	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Finance Bill</h1></div>
	<p>	<b>(Except clauses 3, 9, 10 to 20, 23, 25 and 68)</b></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make an announcement before we start, for the convenience of the Committee. I propose that we have an adjournment for dinner from 7 o'clock till half-past eight o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. On behalf of the Opposition and the Government, I welcome you to our Committee. I should like to raise a matter from our previous sitting, when we discussed debts of overseas Governments and their tax treatment. A substantial amount of money was involved in the issue for major banks, and several Conservative Members spoke in favour of the interests of large banks. Those with interests to declare quite properly declared them, with one exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have a great interest in the clause."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 14 June 1990; c. 223.]</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I declare an interest. In the 1970s, I was a lending banker and, before coming to the House, I was syndication manager of Standard Chartered Bank which, along with many other banks, engaged in sovereign lending"—</p></blockquote>
the tax right-offs of sovereign debt was the matter under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In direct answer to the hon. Lady"—</p></blockquote>
my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was around at the time and aware of what was going on. That is why I have spoken in this debate."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 14 June 1990; c. 226.]</p></blockquote>
That was the extent of the interest that he declared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the latest edition of the document "Register of Members' Interests" he declares under section 2, which deals with employment or office, that he is a parliamentary consultant to Standard Chartered Bank plc. Since the hon. Gentleman spoke far longer on the clause than any other hon. Member, against the thrust of the Government's argument and in favour of the financial interests of banks such as the Standard Chartered Bank plc, surely he should have informed the Committee that he was a parliamentary consultant to one of the banks that had a direct financial interest in the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that this is a matter for the hon. Member himself rather than for the Chairman of this Committee. It could be a matter for the Select Committee on Members' Interests, but it is not possible for me or any other Chairman of this Committee to pursue the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman. Could the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) confirm that he informed my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) that he was about to make this attack on him? It is unfortunate that it should have been made in his absence so that he is unable to defend himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman. I told the hon. Gentleman in our previous sitting that he should declare his interest. He declined to do so on the grounds that it was declared in the "Register of Members' Interests" and so there was no need to tell the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will, perhaps, take note of the measured way in which I replied to the point of order. It does not help to have these exchanges backwards and forwards in Committee. The point has been made. I have said that it is a matter for the hon. Member. If any further action were called for, it would not be a matter for this Committee but for the Select Committee on Members' Interests. It would be helpful to leave the matter there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not disagreeing with you, Mr. Coleman. A misunderstanding has taken place. When I heard my hon. Friend—with whom I subsequently took issue, as I was distressed by the length of his statement—stand up and declare an interest: I thought that that was the end of it. He then went on to elaborate about his previous involvement during the 1970s. Perhaps the misunderstanding is due to faulty punctuation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best thing would be not to pursue this matter any further. If misunderstandings need to be sorted out, it would be best to deal with them behind the scenes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 69</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>WASTE DISPOSAL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Esher)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 56, line 25, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"on or after 6 April 1989"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 178, in page 57, line 26, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(8) This section shall be deemed always to have had effect.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to be able to start our debate on clause 69. Before I do so, I previously said that I would make a disclosure of information—separate from earlier discussions—so I declare that I have taken some advice from the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors. I do not represent that organisation in the House, but I am a non-executive director of a public company that has interests in waste management. I therefore have an interest to disclose related to the amendments that I am proposing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be useful to know which company is involved. There are both cowboy and good companies in this area. It would be helpful to know whether the hon. Gentleman has an interest in one of the good companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does me a great service by inquiring about the company, which is H. T. Hughes plc—a company with a great reputation. Since I joined its board, the company has taken a lead in bringing about environmentally friendly policies for what we all know is a sensitive but important industry. I therefore fully disclose my interest and acknowledge that I possess a very modest number of shares in the company as disclosed in the annual report of accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> The next question would be to ask how little or how much the company pays the hon. Gentleman. I wonder whether he would tell us that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This going backwards and forwards over the same issue is not helping the Committee's progress. That question is irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not rise to that question, Mr. Coleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Coleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Alice Mahon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. I am finding it very difficult to hear with the background noise of traffic coming in through two windows from outside. It is very difficult to hear anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman. In this Room, it can get rather hot. I hate to dispute with my hon. Friend but we have served in Committee a good few days with both sides participating in debates. Admittedly Committee Members occasionally get heated and windows may sometimes need to be open. However, on this occasion, with the noise of the traffic outside and the noise of hon. Members on the inside, we should carefully consider this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how many days you have served in Committee, Mr. Coleman, since you first came to the House and graced these hallowed precincts with your presence. Certainly many debates have taken place on very important matters—not least on whether to operate a ban on smoking. I know that my hon. Friend is not trying to create difficulties, but if such debates were repeated endlessly in each sitting, we could spend hours making those decisions. Perhaps we would, but I doubt whether my hon. Friends would wish to. There is nothing further from the minds of Opposition Members than delaying the progress of the Bill. We all know that the Finance Bill should be the centrepiece of the Government's legislative programme, but such a centrepiece can make progress only when there is consensus in the House. There are great ideological divides—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Consensus is not the issue in the hon. Lady's point of order. The hon. Lady is
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
anxious about the noise from the traffic outside. I suggest that the windows behind me are closed and if we need some fresh air, the windows behind Opposition Members can be opened. The hon. Gentleman is going a little wide. The rules of any Committee in the House do not permit smoking. We should accept my compromise of closing the windows behind me and opening the side windows and then perhaps we can get on with our business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order and your eminent ruling, Mr. Coleman. We should consider the background against which such decisions have been made in the past. I am sure that you have read Sir Robert Cooke's book on the Houses of Parliament, Mr. Coleman and so will realise that in the great fire of 1832, the Select Committee that was established to examine ventilation prompted one of the most fiercely contested parliamentary debates that has ever taken place. The final solution of that debate was evident in the Christmas card that many hon. Members sent to their constituents. The artist's impression on the front of the card showed that the ventilation tower in this building—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whilst I served in the House with Sir Robert Cooke, I did not serve with Sir Robert Peel. What happened in the past is a matter of history. Today we are engaged in discussing the Finance Bill and not in a history lesson. The Committee's job is not to engage in history, but to consider the Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman. The last thing that I wish to do is to contest one of your rulings, which are known throughout the House by all hon. Members who have served under you in various capacities to be the absolute epitomy of wisdom, perhaps excelled only by Solomon. The Opposition want to make progress, but how can we do that when some contributions do not try to help the Committee? Hon. Members have referred to the problem of ventilation. If the windows behind the Chair were opened, that would allow a flood of air in from Westminster Hall. Anyone walking through Westminster Hall will feel a chill. The ghosts of Charles II, or those who made mistakes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must make progress. The hon. Gentleman mentioned Solomon. Solomon requested wisdom and as a result he reigned well. The wisdom of the Committee would be best employed in displaying itself in the proceedings of the Committee and the understanding of the matters before us. It would be much more helpful to the members of the public listening to the Committee if we engaged ourselves properly in our work. The hon. Gentleman is asking me about matters on which I cannot rule, either because they are hypothetical or because they happened in the past and I have no control over them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman. The last thing that I wish to do is delay the proceedings. I have been a Member of Parliament
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
for three years [Hon. Members: "Too long."] but I am naive in these matters and do not understand how they operate. I know that there are things called the usual channels, but I am not sure what they are. In any event, they do not seem to be operating at the moment. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) is not here today because of illness. I hope that his absence and our lack of experience is not being taken advantage of because Opposition Members want to explore many of these issues at great length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman cannot give way to the Financial Secretary because he is addressing a point of order to me and so far I have not discovered what it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman come directly to the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Committee that is to run with due and proper order, requires give and take on both sides. When that is absent, a Committee, even under such expert guidance as yours, Mr. Coleman, descends into chaos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the usual channels will co-operate. I am part of the usual channels and appeal for progress in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. My last point, made as an intervention, led you to intervene. May I invite you to reflect on what you have just said, Mr. Coleman?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much Members of Parliament are paid to make speeches in Committee is of interest to members of a Committee. As I recall, the rules of declaration of interest, which are contained in a book, state that "substantial" shareholdings or a "substantial" amount of land owned by any person should be disclosed. If the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) is receiving a piddling sum for representing the company H. T. Hughes, I do not want to know how much it is. However, it would be of interest to the Committee if such a sum were regarded as substantial, as a speech would then be based on the amount of money given by a company to a Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be rude to the hon. Gentleman but there is a point of principle here that is divorced from the issue. I invite you to reflect on my point, Mr. Coleman, to see whether there is any logic in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that I will reflect on the matter and give it my full consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After that interregnum, I shall concentrate on the point at hand. All my interests are fully disclosed in accordance with the rules of the House and outside the House they are disclosed in accordance with the rules of the Stock Exchange. I stress that I am not paid to make this speech. I hope that the Committee will listen to the experience that
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
I bring to bear as a result of my outside activities which I believe that the House would be wrong to try and stop. Back Benchers would have less of an impact on legislation if that were the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 69 is a welcome move by the Government to reverse a decision made by the courts on 6 April 1989. The decision related to the Rolfe 	<i>v.</i> Wimpey Waste Management Limited case. I did not seek for two of the amendments in my name to be debated first, but as they have been, I must preface my remarks briefly by saying that the waste management industry is extremely important. Land is a finite resource, but waste, apart from a small percentage that can be recycled, is infinite. Consequently, proper management of waste disposal is essential. Most companies, including the one with which I am associated, welcome the increased regulations which are part of the environment protection legislation. Those regulations ensure that waste in landfill sites is disposed of more effectively and in a more environmentally friendly way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the Rolfe 	<i>v.</i> Wimpey Waste Management Limited case arose from the judgment which lumped together certain tax implications of the acquisition of airspace—in other words the hole in the ground—with the costs of preparation and restoration of the landfill site. Costs of preparation and restoration had always been allowed for tax purposes but airspace, which was regarded as land and as a capital asset, had not been allowable against corporation tax. The lumping together of all caused the industry difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy that by introducing clause 69 the Government seek to reverse the situation or reestablish the status quo prior to the Rolfe 	<i>v.</i> Wimpey case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Martlew 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carlisle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman have private negotations with the Minister before the clause came before the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been no private negotiations on any of the amendments in my name, but the industry has had extensive discussions and has lobbied the Treasury. Any interested party might do so on any series of amendments before the Finance Bill Committee. The Government could then save the Committee time by tabling amendments in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman take part in the lobby?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have personally not been part of the lobby, but I disclosed at the beginning of my speech because I thought that the issue should be brought before the Committee, that I have talked to the tax advisers to the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors. It is not a matter of concern that outside bodies lobby the Treasury or discuss matters with members of the Finance Bill Committee. Surely, if we think that something is wrong, we should take it up in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us whether he will benefit financially from the few shares
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
that he holds? I am sorry that hon. Gentlemen find the matter funny, because my question is serious. I have just had a very upsetting experience. When I was a councillor on Calderdale council, two of my colleagues were taken to court on a flimsy excuse. They were found to have had no financial gain, but, technically, were found wrong to have voted in the way that they did. Many Opposition Members find that unacceptable. It is fair to question a member of the Committee who has admitted that he has an interest because he owns shares in a waste disposal company and who has moved major amendments. My question is straightforward. Will the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) directly or indirectly benefit financially, should the amendments be accepted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I went further than I was obliged to, by disclosing a negligible amount of shares in relation to the percentage of the total capital. I did that to help the Committee. I do not know whether I shall benefit, because the Stock Exchange is not always rational. However, waste management companies will benefit from the clarification of some matters tackled by the clause. That is why the Opposition have tabled amendments, which are in the same spirit as those that I tabled. I shall press on, in order to allow the Opposition to present their arguments.

I have set the background to the clause. Although I support Government amendment No. 171, amendments Nos. 173 and 178 attempt to go further than the Government. They seek to ensure that relief for site restoration claims are granted, if they occurred before or after 6 April 1989—when the Court of Appeal made its judgment on the Wimpey case. If clause 69 and new section 91(A) aim to restore the status quo after that case, relief for site restoration payments should not only apply to cases that occurred on or after the 6 April 1989. They should be allowed if they occurred before that date, in accounting periods for which tax assessment are not final. That matter merits further attention from the Treasury. Some companies believe that they have been penalised by the Rolfe 	<i>v.</i> Wimpey Waste Management Ltd case, because their accounts for those periods and for tax assessment are not final. If the Government intend to return to the position that existed before the case, those companies do not understand why they should be penalised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) did not present a convincing case. He must correct me if I am wrong, because he is a director of a waste management company and has been involved with the industry's taxation and administration affairs for many years. My knowledge of waste management is not as broad as his.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 69 was put forward by the Treasury, for reasons that I hope the Financial Secretary will explain. I do not understand why companies would be penalised if amendments Nos. 173 and 178 were not accepted. The judgment of the Rolfe 	<i>v.</i> Wimpey Waste Management Ltd case was given on 6 April 1989. Presumably tax affairs settled, and payments and deductions allowed before that date will not be
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
disturbed. If I am wrong about that, I hope that the hon. Member for Esher will intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those payments and deductions are not to be disturbed, the amendment is pointless unless more tax concessions could be given to waste disposal companies. It is important to consider the appeal judgment in Rolfe 	<i>v.</i> Wimpey Waste Management Ltd., from which we shall often quote in our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot hear. Could my hon. Friend speak up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 456 of "Simon's Tax Cases", Lord Justice Dillon's judgment says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are four principal headings of expenditure: the acquisition costs of the landfill site; the preparation costs before tipping begins; the costs of obtaining planning permission and other licenses (the disposal licence in particular); and the cost of restoring the site at the end of the tipping operation. In addition there are certain other classes of expenditure: first, abortive expenditure—investigating sites that prove useless, and secondly on occasion writing down the value of sites when it appears appropriate if their potential is felt not to be what it had originally been believed to be. But it is common ground that all these heads, principal or ancilliary, stand or fall together—no distinction needs to be drawn."</p></blockquote>
It appears that the hon. Gentleman's company and the waste disposal industry led Lord Justice Dillon to believe that all costs—whether of acquisition, disposal or restoration—stood or fell together. There was no dispute about that from either side in the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Esher does not question Lord Justice Dillon's principal judgment—that the acquisition of a site is a capital acquisition as opposed to being of a revenue nature, why has he tabled the amendment? The waste disposal industry was united with the tax commissioners in saying that all those expenditures stood or fell together. Why has the hon. Gentleman tabled an amendment that seeks to backdate the clause's effect on restoration payments? I suspect that the hon. Member for Esher originally was prepared to go along with the argument because he thought that he could get the whole basket of cherries. Lord Justice Dillon saw to that—he took away not only the basket of cherries, but the vehicle in which they were brought. We agree with the hon. Member for Esher that that is a little unfair, but to what extent was Lord Justice Dillon's judgment the result of representations by the waste management industry? Did the industry get the case horribly and completely wrong? Were their representatives incompetent when they put the case to Mr. Justice Harman and Lord Justice Dillon, even though the tax commissioners had earlier found in their favour?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what went on. I have no interest in waste management. I own no shares in any waste management company, nor in any land on which someone might hope to find airspace or which anyone might want to dig up to make a store for waste. Nor have I been approached or lobbied by a waste management company. I hope, therefore, that my approach is entirely disinterested. My intention is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
merely to get to the bottom of this puzzle, and I must say that I have not been in any way satisfied by what the hon. Member for Esher has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a few other questions that I hope the hon. Gentleman will be able to answer. Amendment No. 173 appears straightforward. Its aim is to strike out from clause 69 the words on page 56, line 25,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"on or after 6 April 1989".</p></blockquote>
The Government intend that new section 91A of the Taxes Act 1988 should apply only after the judgment from Lord Justice Dillon, but the amendment to clause 69 would make it applicable as far back as anyone is likely to go. Would that not impose on the Inland Revenue a considerable, extra administrative burden? Many waste management companies may apply for extra tax deductions. At present, they can only get tax back for six years, but if the amendment is accepted it is possible that in next year's Finance Bill discussions we shall receive letters pressing for the limit to be extended to 10, 20 or even 30 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, but he has been speaking rather quickly and I need to clarify his argument. There is a national association of waste disposal contractors. Does my hon. Friend recollect being lobbied by that organisation about the amendment? Has he received anything about the problems that the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) has identified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) that I do not recollect being lobbied or receiving any letters on the subject. I do not know whether any Opposition Members have received such letters from the waste management industry. That makes me wonder whether that industry is relying on certain Government Members to get the amendment through. There is nothing wrong with being lobbied, but I hope that those hon. Members would tell the Committee why the amendment has been tabled. It is possible, of course, that the hon. Member for Esher has thought of it all by himself, that he is not in any way the puppet of the waste management industry, and that he does not hope to become the next Economic Secretary when the incumbent moves on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a load of rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a load of rubbish. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has said that before, and he is wrong. The whole clause is about rubbish, but the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might like to consider the fact that amendment No. 178 appears to give retrospective benefit. Is it not somewhat illogical for Conservative Members, who are in virtually all circumstances opposed to giving retrospective liability to tax, to argue for retrospective benefits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) makes a
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
pertinent point. A number of hon. Members do not like retrospective legislation when it hurts their particular interests. I include myself as one of them on occasion. I would be very much against any legislation that would tax my constituents in retrospect after they had made their budgets and their plans. In this case, however, retrospective legislation would be of benefit—to the waste disposal industry. Perhaps we should flush out how much benefit to the waste disposal industry there would be if the amendment were passed. There might be a problem if it encouraged a large number of waste disposal companies to go to the Revenue to ask for their books and accounts to be reopened. They might want to go further back than the past six years and the Revenue would resist that. I do not understand who would prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 178, which is coupled with amendment No. 173, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section shall be deemed always to have had effect."</p></blockquote>
If it had always had effect, how far back could we go? Could we go back further than six years? If we could not, the hon. Member for Esher will need to take advice on tabling further amendments on Report to ensure that his intention can be carried out. Even then, the amendment would not be realistic. After so many years, records are inevitably lost. People's memory becomes imperfect and they cannot remember precisely what happened. Financial transactions can be extremely complicated involving contractors, sub-contractors and ad hoc payments and they keep an army of accountants alive and living in good style. The mounds of paper involved are difficult to imagine and after 10 years, many records are thrown away. What would happen if a waste management company that had thrown away its records came along and said, "The amendment has been passed and we believe that we should have an extra tax deduction but we cannot prove it."? The amendment says nothing about the onus of proof. How does the hon. Member for Esher envisage claims being made and settled? I hope that the Financial Secretary will take a robust view and not give way to the hon. Gentleman because I foresee many problems with the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Member for Esher explain the effect of the clause? I suspect that the Financial Secretary knows how much it will cost the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew as little about what the hon. Member for Esher hoped to achieve when he finished speaking to the amendment as I did before he stood up to speak. He told us that attempts were being made to reverse the Rolfe 	<i>v.</i> Wimpey decision made in April 1989. He said that waste is infinite, which we know already, and that we need proper, planned waste management, but he did not fully explain the matter. Perhaps he feels slightly handicapped in spelling out exactly what he hopes to achieve by his amendment. My hon. Friend might be able to tempt the hon. Gentlemen into being more specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax. She is right. We must know
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
what will be the effect of the clause. I do not mean any disrespect to the hon. Member for Esher. But is it not sufficient simply to say that, because of Lord Justice Dillon's judgment and because the Government are introducing new legislation under clause 69, it would have been fair if that legislation had existed previously. We must know whether the provision is operable, who will benefit and by how much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee might be interested to know that we are not discussing tens or hundreds of pounds, but very large sums. I refer to the original decision taken by Mr. Justice Harmon on 29 March 1988 in the case of Rolfe 	<i>v.</i> Wimpey Waste Management Limited. He comments that the pound had lost value and how the sum of money involved was great. Page 331 of "Simon's Tax Cases" refers to the appeals lodged by Wimpey Waste Management Limited against its corporation tax assessments for each accounting period. During the accounting period to 1978, the amount was £10,000 and the date of assessment was 16 July 1979. That does not sound much, but Wimpey Waste Management started operations at about that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report states that, in 1980, the amount had increased to £100,000 and, in 1981, had increased to £1 million. In 1982, the figure was £1 million; in 1983, it was £1.5 million and the last figure given by the report is £1,887,968. That is the assessment for corporation tax purposes. We must not assume that that is the amount of money at stake. Nevertheless, members of the Committee should bear in mind the size of the figure. That is why we insist on some answers to our questions. The matter is important as the assessment may now be higher than £1,887,968. What would be the effect not only on Wimpey Waste Management Limited, but on the Inland Revenue, as a result of claims by all the waste management companies under the clause? I have asked important questions. The sums involved are large. The Committee should demand a full explanation of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) tabled two amendments that would make the new tax relief back-dated not to 1989, as we proposed immediately after the court case, but indefinitely. That would not be consistent with the way in which we normally handle changes in the law. It would not be a desirable precedent. General practice is to introduce new tax reliefs either from Budget day or from the tax year following the Budget. When a new relief is being introduced in response to a court decision, we sometimes go further than that, backdating relief to the date of the court decision. That is what we are doing here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is generally accepted practice that if the Government decide to change the law following a court decision, the decision in that case itself is not altered by the legislation. I doubt whether the Committee would wish to alter that practice. In the context of the clause, it would be quite unprecedented to give statutory relief to Wimpey Waste Management that the court had decided was not due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
As for other cases that were open when the Wimpey case was decided, the general practice is that a judicial decision on the interpretation of tax law is applied to any cases open when that decision was made. We should need strong reasons for departing from that practice. It does not seem that we have such reasons here. Before the Wimpey case, expenditure on restoring waste disposal sites was, so far as the Inland Revenue is aware, generally allowed for tax purposes as a deduction in computing profit. But because no central record of individual cases is available, the Revenue cannot say that relief was given in all cases. Some cases may have been settled on the basis that relief was not due. There was no hard and fast practice; to extend relief retrospectively to open cases would hardly be fair to those who have settled earlier on the basis that relief was not due.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have an estimate—he should have—of how much that will cost the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will have seen from the notes on clauses, it is impossible to estimate. No central record has been kept of how previous cases were decided. As we do not know that, we cannot estimate how many would be open for reassessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at that reply. The right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) has said that he could assess what all sorts of things would cost a Labour Government. Given the help that the Minister gets from the Civil Service and others, surely he could have answered that simple question. Perhaps the right hon. Member for Mole Valley has the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that there is a similarity between a Labour Government and rubbish disposal, but I have never heard the comparison so closely drawn. Several bankers have been able to cost the Labour programme because it was published centrally; the court cases are not collected centrally. For that reason, I do not recommend the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer to an intervention that I made in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). Waste disposal has too often been left to people who have no concern for the environment, for those who work in the industry or for anyone else. I come from a part of the country that suffered a major tragedy with the asbestos scandal in the early 1960s, at Acre Mill, Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire. That was in a neighbouring constituency, but many of my constituents worked there. I know the importance of getting rid of dangerous waste, because we are still suffering the consequences of that disastrous exercise, which did not affect only those who worked in the mill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend does not go on for more than another hour or so. I have spent an extremely profitable 15 minutes in the Library researching the question of the ventilation of the

House of Commons and the expulsion of waste which has been debated in the relevant Select Committee for some two years. The Committee will be anxious to hear the results of my research at some length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for this intervention, and look forward to his contribution to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Calderdale are still living with the consequences of badly managed waste disposal. No doubt every hon. Member could point to sites in his or her constituency that have suffered from bad management. This is an important issue and I make no excuse for asking the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) why he is moving the amendments, and who will benefit from them. Will it be the community at large? What guarantees are there that the hon. Gentleman will be able to obtain financial relief for the companies? Am I right in thinking that that is his aim? I make no excuses; I want detail from the hon. Gentleman who moved his amendment briefly, and vaguely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham, who was very patient, and he understands how seriously we take these matters. I wonder why we have not been lobbied by the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors. I have reread all the papers, with the assistance of my husband, and we have found nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NAWDC, presumably, represents waste disposal contractors. Why has the organisation not lobbied Labour Members? Has it lobbied the hon. Member for Esher, and other Conservative Members? Surely the association's reason for existing is to represent waste disposal contractors. If it is not, what does it do? I find the name of the organisation in some of the documents I received from the Library to help me in the debate. I confess that I know little about the waste disposal industry, and had hoped to find myself in a learning curve today. That was not to be; the mover of the amendment told us nothing to help Opposition Members to make up their minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been a member of a local authority, and when I questioned the hon. Member for Esher on his interests I found myself staggered, even after three years in the House, to find that hon. Members can take part in debates, move amendments, and go through the lobbies and vote after they have said, "I declare an interest; I am a consultant" or "I have shares in this industry." I see those hon. Members as beneficiaries of the legislation that they are proposing. Their financial interest seems plain to me, but, Mr Coleman, I shall not go into the rules of the House too deeply. You would rule me out of order if I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will allude to Members' interests; they are relevant to the debate.

I enjoy the great privilege of serving on the Select Committee on Members' Interests, and find it an enlightening experience. I have the Register of Members' Interests with me and should like to quote from it at length at a more appropriate time later. My hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are not here to debate Members' interests, but the amendment. I have been fairly easy going so far, but I remind the Committee that the amendment refers to the tax treatment of waste. We are not discussing waste in general. Will members of the Committee please stick strictly to the issue of tax treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your timely advice, Mr. Coleman. It would help the Committee if we put on the record the judgment of that particular case. I shall read out the report from the Court of Appeal that was published in 	<i>The Times</i> on 7 April. It is important for members of the Committee to understand the judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend read it extremely carefully, as I am completely thrown by its legal jargon? Will she give a slow and clear exposition of that convoluted and complex legal judgment?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that helpful intervention. Sometimes, one could be accused of wasting time, but this is an important matter that needs time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report in The Times from the Court of Appeal was headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Land fill sites are not current assets"</p></blockquote>.
The case was brought by Rolfe—the inspector of taxes—and Wimpey Waste Management Ltd and was heard before Lord Justices Dillon, Russell and Mann. The judgment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Land fill sites acquired by the waste disposal company for use for a limited period of time as tipping space constituted capital and not current assets of the company.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The substantial expenditure incurred on acquiring and setting up those sites was not allowable as a deduction in computing the company's profits for corporation tax purposes.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Court of Appeal so held dismissing an appeal by the taxpayer company, Wimpey Waste Management Ltd, from the decision of Mr. Justice Harman … that had upheld an appeal by the Crown from a determination of a special commissioner allowing an appeal against corporation tax assessments made on it for accounting periods from 1978 to 1984."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those decisions are not made on a mere whim. You, Mr. Coleman, sit in judgment in maintaining order in the Committee, so will know that such convoluted arguments can take many days. In this instance, my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax referred to 6 April when the case was heard by three eminent justices on 4, 5 and 6 April. That was not a fly-by-night operation in which they had a cup of tea, asked who thought what and sat for five minutes before giving a judgment—the matter, was considered seriously and in detail for a long period. In this instance, the period was three days and we know from our many learned colleagues in the House that a legal day can be very onerous.

I was not sure how many days the appeal had taken but his comments show that the Justices dealt with the matter seriously and in detail. Furthermore, until I obtained those documents from the Library, I was also unaware that the taxpayer company was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. That demonstrates the great care with which the matter was dealt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly the same circumstances prevailed in the case brought by BP Australia Ltd against the taxation authorities in 1966—AC224. There was no possibility of referral to a higher authority and I hope that my hon. Friend will later give way because that case needs to be cited at length. Otherwise, Conservative Members may become confused about this extremely important clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To carry on with the report of the judgment that appeared in 	<i>The Times,</i> it stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The taxpayer company became involved in waste disposal in 1977 and thereafter acquired sites to use for tipping. By 1984 it was providing a comprehensive disposal service to both the private and the public sectors and had some 20 freehold or leasehold sites that were licensed for use for the tipping of waste."</p></blockquote>
From the brief research that I have carried out, I understand that the sites had an average life expectancy of seven years and that is confirmed in the report. When infilling was completed they were restored in accordance with the conditions specified in the licences and then disposed of for grazing or
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
parkland purposes. That worried many of us who served on local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer to one site near a mink farm in my constituency where the local authority contractor filled in the site. I went there following a complaint from a constituent and I was not sure which was the most untidy—the outside of the mink farm or the supposedly restored tipping site.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Topsoiling is probably one of the biggest problems, perhaps in the same sense as in the case of Beauchamp (Inspector of Taxes) v. Woolworth (F.W.) 1988. In that case British Coal had topsoiled a tip and, due to rain, the contradiction between the substrata of the slag heap and the topsoil was like a continuous band among the long grasses. That resulted in the creation of practically a land slip. Part of the site was exposed; it had greenery around the edge and a large slag dome in the middle. Some may say that that would have an artistic effect, but they would not say that if they lived near the site.

I hope that my hon. Friend will not take more than another one and half hours because we wish to discuss some of the issues relating to reclamation and waste.

I am worried about the time span that elapses between infilling of sites and landscaping them for other uses if they become grazing areas or play areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report from which I was quoting states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the taxpayer company's audited accounts the sites were shown as constituting current assets and the taxpayer company claimed that all the expenditure that it had incurred annually on acquiring sites, preparing and developing them and on allocating sums for land restoration was of a revenue nature and deductible in computing its liability to tax. The tax inspector had rejected all those claims."</p></blockquote>
That is important and very clear.

Like my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, I have obtained considerable information from the Library and my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, (Mr. Brown), and I shall go into detail on that later if we can obtain some answers from the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) who tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend does not use all the information this evening, because some of us are looking forward to Thursday evening's debate on the clause. We should not rush through the clause because it deserves far more consideration than my hon. Friend has given it. Many people, such as myself, who live in former mining areas—sadly, the Government have closed all the pits in my constituency—would love to continue the debate, particularly on the question of reclamation. Certainly there are holes in the ground, but there are also inversions—slag heaps—on top of the ground. It seems a paradox that the holes in the ground and the large slag heaps created through digging holes in the ground are both part of the same problem, and there should be more consideration of this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with interest to what the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) has to say, and it is very good indeed. However, unfortunately my train of thought and her presentation are being interrupted by long interventions. I hope that Committee members will bear that in mind and help the hon. Lady and myself so that I can better understand what is being said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of order, but an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about the tax inspector who has rejected the claim from the taxpayer's company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) talks about the tax inspector who rejected the claim, I should add that my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) was right that it took the Appeal Court three days to deliver that judgment. Here we have an amendment that cuts across the whole question of taxation on waste management. I have no doubt that my hon Friend the Member for Halifax agrees that other amendments may be narrower in scope, and that this one is quite wide. I hope that she will deliver her views with care, as I should like to seek to catch your eye later, Mr. Coleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try. My hon. Friend will be patient as this is a very specialised area. We have not been helped, as we have not been lobbied. Often that can be a useful procedure for hon. Members who are dealing with areas in which some Committee members have detailed expertise. Obviously the hon. Member for Esher, who is the director of a waste disposal company, has the advantage over me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had to do my own research into waste disposal, with tiny bits of knowledge from my local authority experience. However, I was never on a committee that dealt with waste disposal, and tended to be on health and housing committees. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) will agree that there are so few women councillors and women hon. Members that we tend to be ghettoised into certain committees. I am sad about that. Later in life I have come to realise that matters such as waste disposal are vital to all of us, yet because of the organisation of society women get pushed into those other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Diane Abbott 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to my hon. Friend. Would she agree that the issue of waste disposal, which concerns the future of the planet, is one of considerable relevance to women?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I thank my hon. Friend who with her usual eloquence has emphasised the point that I sought to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the hon. Lady think about the merits of the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be patient. His hon. Friend gave us so little information and insight into what he sought that I have felt it necessary to go through the judgment in detail, as it is very relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. Since the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) clearly has not followed the relevance of my hon. Friend's contribution, perhaps my hon. Friend should begin again and go more slowly. I warned about the problem of rushing through the clause, particularly as my hon. Friend dealt with a case that took three days among learned justices. We have already encountered problems with the speed with which my hon. Friend seeks to make progress causing great concern among Conservative Members. Perhaps my hon. Friend would take us through the amendment again more slowly and carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may find herself in difficulty with the rules of the House over tedious repetition if she did that. She is explaining her case extremely well and the hon. Gentleman should let her continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant no personal slight to my hon. Friend the way she is presenting her case. Opposition Members have understood my hon. Friend's explanation, but the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) appeared not to recognise its relevance. My hon. Friend may have assumed that the hon. Gentleman knew about the matter. He is most eminent in many spheres and he receives cross-party acclaim, but this may not be one of his strong points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be relieved, Mr. Coleman, to know that I am not going to repeat what I have already said. I wish to carry on where I left off and refer to the tax inspector who had rejected all the claims that were outlined in the document:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"The commissioner who heard the appeal found that in relation to each site that the identifiable asset was the airspace that it provided supported by the land, coupled with the relevant permission to deal with it in a particular way."</p></blockquote>
The airspace is one of the few things about which the hon. Member for Esher enlightened us. He said that the airspace was the hole. I had already sussed that out for myself. I was pleased to note, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington will be, that, in referring to the commissioner, the next paragraph in the report starts "She determined". That must be very good for women. We are always on the lookout for women in high positions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. May I suggest that the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
filibuster. His constant remarks that people should take a long time will appear clearly on the record and will be seen by everyone as filibustering. I fully understand the reasons why the Opposition wish to filibuster although I think that they are foolish and mistaken, and that their filibuster is pointless. If there is to be a filibuster, let it be in the style of the hon. Member for Halifax who deals with substantive matters and not in the pathetic style of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North who is disregarding your judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the hon. Member for Halifax is gracing us with a most enlightened speech. It would be extremely helpful if the hon. Lady were allowed to continue. She is displaying a great deal of expertise which I appreciate, but I do not appreciate it being punctuated constantly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman. I found the Financial Secretary's remarks deeply hurtful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Offensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am not offended, but I am hurt. The Committee has been friendly, especially under your chairmanship, Mr. Coleman. It is out of character for the Financial Secretary to impugn those motives to me. The hon. Gentleman will have seen the figures in the Financial Times which show that, the Government's borrowing requrement is going through the roof. Perhaps that is why—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That has nothing to do with the taxation of waste. I suggest that the Hon. Gentleman allows the hon. Member for Halifax to continue her speech which she is giving with great expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Coleman, that is very gallant and more good-tempered than the Financial Secretary's intervention. The report stated that the commissioner, whom I was delighted to discover is a woman, determined that
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"although land was traditionally regarded as a capital asset in the instant case it has to be regarded"—</p></blockquote>
the photocopy from the Library is not too good as I want to get the grammatical sense of the words correct, I shall repeat that.
	<br><blockquote><p>"She determined that although land was traditionally regarded as a capital asset, in the instant case it had to be regarded in the light of the business for whose purposes it had been acquired and as such had more in common with a builder's trading stock than with fixed assets of an investor in land and as such constituted current assets."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I want to abide by what you said, Mr. Coleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse your views, Mr. Coleman, on some of the interventions that we have heard. However, on a technical point, my hon. Friend touches on the concept of a hole as physical property,
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
which, to a lay person and perhaps to you, Mr. Coleman, would seem to be an odd concept. The idea that fresh air is regarded as property requires detailed explanation. It is reminiscent of a song sung by Bernard Cribbins, which goes something like this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There was I, digging a hole.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A hole in the ground, so big and sort of round.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It's not there now.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The ground's all flat and beneath it is a man in a bowler hat."</p></blockquote>
That song could allude to the type of people to whom my hon. Friend refers—people from local councils and inspectors. Being an inventive man, Bernard Cribbins was perhaps technically aiming at that concept of a hole as property as defined by the man in the bowler hat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I want to discuss Bernard Cribbins and the hole in the ground. I am sure that I should empty the Committee Room very quickly if I attempted to sing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lord Justice Dillon said that the commissioner was wrong in identifying the relevant assets as 'air space'. The assets were the land sites acquired, or interests in them.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Moreover, the sites did not have anything in common with land that was held by a builder as trading stock. The taxpayer company collected waste and deposited it in the land fill sites but never disposed of the sites to its customers.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The sites were essentially the places where the taxpayer company carried on its business of placing and compacting its waste."</p></blockquote>
That is clear. I am grateful to 	<i>The Times</i> because the report has cleared up certain issues that were puzzling me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 	<i>Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick</i> ([1966] AC 295)"—</p></blockquote>
I am sorry if my hon. Friends intended to refer to this judgment, but I shall refer briefly to it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the House of Lords held that leases, some as short as five years, were held by the oil company as capital assets.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Here the land fill sites were held on average for seven years from the start to the finish. The length of time that an asset was held was a very relevant factor."</p></blockquote>
There is another reference to the case. I do not need to go into great detail now and I do not want to disappoint my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, but I am anxious to continue with this judgment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the instant case the land fill sites gave essential continuity to the taxpayer company's business for the by no means trivial period they were held."</p></blockquote>
That would lead to conclude that large amounts were made during the years in which the hole in the ground was being filled up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is referring to a report in 	<i>The Times,</i> which is not a newspaper that I admit to reading. In my part of the country, when people talk about reading 	<i>The Times</i> they mean Glasgow's 	<i>Evening Times,</i> a popular evening newspaper. The "London Times" as we refer to the newspaper from which my hon. Friend is quoting, is rarely seen in that city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not familiar with the case to which my hon. Friend referred. Will she clarify what is meant by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
"air space" in the report? I have also heard it mentioned by the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor). Does it mean the hole dug in the ground? Is it the area above the space, or that left after the infilling is completed? It seems an abstract concept and I am having difficulty getting to grips with it. Does Lord Justice Dillon comment on it in his report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he does. I was about to mention that. "Airspace" is the hole in the ground—it is what is being used. I should like to go through this quite slowly as I want to be certain that I understand the points made in the case. As I have said repeatedly, we were given little information when the amendment was moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to anticipate any remarks that my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) may make, but it might be helpful if I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) that I hope, with your permission, Mr. Coleman, to refer later to the case of Sun Newspapers Ltd. I shall not be referring to Sun Newspapers Ltd as presently constituted because this case, involving the tax authorities, took place in 1938. The case is the Sun Newspapers Ltd v. the Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1938), and the reference is 61 CLR 357. Although it was a long time ago, it is relevant to the questions of newspaper ownership, print and filling in holes in the ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the explanation should come from the hon. Lady who has the floor. I remind her that it is up to her whether she permits interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may recap a little. I shall try and explain to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) about airspace. The report in 	<i>The Times</i> said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the instant case the land fill sites gave essential continuity to the taxpayer company's business for the by no means trivial period they were held—new sites then being acquired as might be needed.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In his judgment, Mr. Justice Harman referred to the 	<i>Regent Oil case and to BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia</i> [1966] … and then expressed his conclusion thus:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'… [the taxpayer company] has to have places (I avoid any specific word) where it could get rid of the waste which it had contracted to dispose of. It needed places. It needed, counsel said, space. His word was "airspace".' "</p></blockquote>
I think that that answers the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been some speculation about what airspace constitutes and whether it is a relevant concept for the purposes of our deliberations. But as far as property developers are concerned, airspace and air rights are very important concepts. Half of the Broadgate development in Hackney, in my constituency, has been built on what were British Rail's air rights as railway line. I will expand on that theme later in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. Mr. Coleman, do we still have a quorum in the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We still have a quorum. Carry on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may return to the part of the judgment that deals with airspace. Mr. Justice Harman referred to a judgment between BP Australia Ltd and the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia. Because of the confusion about the meaning of the word "airspace", it is worth repeating that Mr. Justice Harman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… [the taxpayer company] has to have places (I avoid any specific word) where it could get rid of the waste which it had contracted to dispose of. It needed places. it needed, counsel said, space. His word was "airspace". It is obviously true in a sense that it needs airspace, because unless there is a hole you cannot put something into it."</p></blockquote>
That is as wonderful a truism as I have ever heard. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the other hand, it is quite plain that airspace is not something which even the most ingenious conveyancer of Lincoln's Inn has ever dealt with as an item of property unrelated to the ground over which it lay.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>What the taxpayer company acquired was not airspace, it was land… It was quite clear that the taxpayer company was undoubtedly acquiring real assets."</p></blockquote>
	<i>The Times</i> went on to report Lord Justice Dillon's judgment.
	<br><blockquote><p>"That conclusion was correct. Putting the matter broadly and having regard not only to the fact that what was involved in incurring the expenditure was land but also to the period of its use and the financing arrangements, the sites were capital assets of the taxpayer company.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In 	<i>Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Ltd,</i> Lord Wilberforce commented that the consequences of the findings of facts by commissioners involved a pure question of law.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Thus there was no difficulty in upholding Mr. Justice Harman's decision. It was plain that the commissioner went wrong in law and had misdirected herself. The court was entitled to interfere with her determination."</p></blockquote>
That is the Court of Appeal Judgment that I read—more than once, I must admit—in 	<i>The Times.</i> The Committee is entitled to expect the hon. Member for Esher to have gone into some detail about that judgment and about some of the reasons behind the decision. I do not apologise for using the Committee's time in studying the report in detail. I only wish that some Conservative Members would be frank about what they seek to gain for the waste disposal companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment, I am sorry. Quite right. The hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor), having listened to the Financial Secretary, may beg leave to withdraw the clause. That would be a mistake. The clause is a giant give-away to the waste disposal industry. He has tried to slip it in at 4.30 pm before we were all here. We have listened to the debate and we shall not be caught out. The sum that would be given away would be so large that the Financial Secretary would not dare release a figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that we are considering an amendment, not the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Coleman. Amendments Nos. 173 and 178 were both tabled by the hon. Member for Esher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am worried about the details of amendment No. 178, despite the printing error in the papers in front of us. The amendment is retrospective and could have large financial consequences. The case for it has not been made. If it were to be argued that retrospective relief would discourage illegal fly tipping by contractors and encourage the use of proper, licensed sites, it would be worth balancing it against the potential costs. No such argument has been made. It is difficult to properly assess the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. Do I understand that once we have discussed all the amendments, we can have a full and comprehensive debate on clause stand part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will depend upon how we proceed and whether we have exhausted all the points to be made on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), that is not a question to ask the Chairman at this stage. I ask my hon. Friend to leave that to lie for a little longer. There are many amendments and many points to be made about them, not least that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). However, unless my hon. Friends can say otherwise, it is a point that must be left until a later clause. It cannot influence the amendment that we are considering, which is retrospective. The amendment would mean that the benefits that are to be bestowed—some quite properly—on the waste disposal industry would apply not from 6 April 1989 but without limit, no matter how far back one were to go. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury suggested that there might be some environmental benefits from the amendment. The only way such benefits might arise would be if the waste disposal industry were to decide to spend its extra money on environmental benefits. I suspect that most of the industry would simply give the money to
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
shareholders or double directors' salaries. I realise that that would not apply to all companies—there are some good ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury was saying that we would be more likely to support the amendment if it had some environmental bearing. Fly tipping is a grave issue and an environmental hazard. Constituents visit my surgery every week to complain about it. People dispose of gas and electrical cookers on fly tips. If the amendment were relevant to that, we should regard it differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. Does the hon. Member for Esher envisage that the amendment could have any environmental benefit? I do not believe that it has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boeteng) is here, because he is an expert on the waste disposal industry. He has a list of questions in his pocket. I must tell him that we are still discussing the first group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I might withdraw the amendments on a point of order, because of the Opposition's convincing arguments and the detailed reply given by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman will be allowed to withdraw the amendments on a point of order.

Before he does so—and I would prefer to vote the amendments down—will he answer some of the questions pertaining to the clause that my hon. Friends and I have asked? I shall refer again to the appeal, which was heard by Lord Justice Dillon, and the final paragraph on page 455 of "Simon's Tax Cases", because I want to consider the precise amount of money that the Treasury would give, in tax concessions, to the waste disposal industry, should the amendment be accepted. Lord Justice Dillon summarises the various activities, and the paragraph encapsulates my points in an ordered list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury put that in our policy review? That might elicit an answer from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I can say nothing to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) for the suggestion. But experience shows that publishing Labour party policy documents leads Conservative Members to ask many questions. When we question their approach, we receive very few answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lord Justice Dillon says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The business involves collecting waste from customers and dumping it in waste disposal sites. These are sites, also called
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
landfill sites, in respect of which a disposal licence has been obtained from the county council."</p></blockquote>
That deals with waste collection. If the amendment were accepted, would the waste disposal industry claim further tax concessions from the Treasury because of collecting waste from customers? Would the industry claim further tax concessions because of dumping? I do not object to the amendment not making that clear because it is obliged only to be legally watertight. However, as members of a Committee that is scrutinising proposed legislation and its effect on public revenue—in this case, on public revenue foregone—we must ask for clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Justice Dillon states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These are sites, also called landfill sites, in respect of which a disposal licence has been obtained from the county council."</p></blockquote>
It would be interesting to know whether any tax concessions have been received in the past because of efforts made by waste disposal companies to obtain county council disposal licences. As I understand it, expenditure incurred in that activity will be tax allowable if the clause is agreed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the clause. If the clause is agreed to, the expenditure will be tax allowable. I want to know whether, if the amendment is agreed to, previous expenditure for licences already issued will also be allowable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Justice Dillon continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such a licence specifies the kinds and quantities of waste that may be deposited and prescribed conditions that must be complied with."</p></blockquote>
Costs may be incurred in separating wastes collected so that only those that may be dumped or deposited on the landfill site under the licence are so deposited. I understand that under the clause, such expenditure would be tax allowable, it being revenue expenditure incurred in the normal run of the tax paying company's business or trade. Was it allowable in the past? If it was not, the amendment would make it allowable and that would be an extra drain on the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Justice Dillon further states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The disposal licence is only granted if an appropriate planning permission is in force and there is no likelihood of pollution of water or danger to the public health."</p></blockquote>
I suspect that planning permission will be tax allowable. Before a company can dump waste it needs planning permission for which charges may be made. Will the hon. Member for Esher tell us whether charges for planning permission can be reimbursed as a general principle by a company carrying on a trade and be offset against corporation tax? I do not know, and perhaps it is something that I should know. If they can be offset under the clause, a great deal of money would be lost to the Revenue if the amendment were passed and added to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Planning permission is not the only consideration. It is also necessary to ascertain whether there is any likelihood of water pollution or danger to public health. Those are difficult questions to answer and I am sure that waste disposal companies spend a great
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
deal of money investigating them. I would not object to such activities being tax allowable because it is in the public interest to have a safe water supply free from pollution. There must be no risk of endangering public health as a result of waste tipping by any company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment this far. I hope that it will be true in the future. If it were not true in the past, there would be an unexpected windfall for waste disposal companies—a windfall that I suspect that they had no thought of receiving. Companies would be surprised, if the Committee passed the amendment and the clause, at the amount of money that they could claim. That may be unjustified as companies have made their accounts and done their sums with a view to offsetting certain aspects of their work against tax according to circumstances. They may have been able to juggle their accounts in the past and may continue to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Justice Dillon goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has been the practice of the taxpayer to acquire disused gravel pits or quarries and, having obtained the necessary permissions and licences, to fill them in with the customer's waste. Such landfill sites may be acquired by the taxpayer by outright purchase of the freehold or by acquiring a long or short lease at a premium or by obtaining for a premium a licence to tip on the land. In some cases the taxpayer may tip by agreement on some other operator's landfill site."</p></blockquote>
That is another part of the business succinctly and clearly expressed by Lord Justice Dillon in his summing up. He clarifies another activity undertaken by the waste disposal industry. It would be interesting to know—and the hon. Member for Esher should tell the Committee—whether any new benefit will accrue from that part of a company's activities in respect of taxation if the amendment were passed. If so, how much will the waste disposal industry get?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Justice Dillon continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After a disposal licence has been granted and before any waste can be deposited, certain preparatory works must be completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and the disposal authority, and these will or may include site roads, security fencing and gates and a site control office."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Esher knows what I shall ask. Are these activities, or have they been, tax allowable? If they are, his amendment will have little effect. But I suspect that some of these activities have not been tax-allowable in the past, and that his amendment will make them so. If so, how much will it cost the Treasury? A lot of money could be involved. Roads and site control offices, which have to be manned, can be very expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Justice Dillon continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the infilling has been completed the landfill site has to be restored in accordance with the conditions laid down in the planning permission. This generally involves covering the waste with a layer of clay one metre deep on top of which is spread a layer of top soil to promote plant growth."</p></blockquote>
Here we arrive at the nub of clause 69, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The following sections shall be inserted after section 91 of the Taxes Act 1988—".</p></blockquote>
Underneath, the subject of the clause is defined as "Waste disposal: restoration payments." We are now at the heart of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 91A states that the new section applies
	<br><blockquote><p>"on or after 6th April 1989".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
The hon. Member for Esher is attempting to scrub out those words to make the section apply however many years have gone by. If one assumes that that amendment is not otiose, there must be something behind it, but we have not seen what it is. If there is nothing behind the amendment, because of previous provisions creating air space, landfill sites and so on and the seeking of planning permission and licenses to dispose, it is innocuous. There must be something about restoration behind it. I hope that the hon. Member for Esher will tell us whether waste companies have been unable to obtain tax concessions when they have had to restore a site and put down a layer of clay lm deep on the waste, and thereafter a layer of topsoil to promote plant growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities may demand more than lm of clay covered with a layer of topsoil. They may demand that shrubs and grass are planted, and that the site is monitored and tested regularly to ensure that there has been no build up of methane gas or any other toxic substance—in addition to any monitoring done while the site is being filled in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are restoration activities that are central to the clause. The clause applies to such activities only when they were undertaken on or after 6 April 1989. The amendment seeks to delete that date and to make the clause apply to activities that have taken place in earlier years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much would the amendment cost the Treasury? The Financial Secretary will not tell us. I suspect that the sum is astronomic. Lord Justice Dillon continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The average life expectancy of the taxpayer's landfill sites is in the region of seven years from preparation through infilling to completion. It may be as much as ten years. The working or earning life of a site, that is the infill period, is approximately four years unless extended by the acquisition of adjacent land. On completion of the making good after infilling, the lease of a leasehold site will probably be surrendered to the landlord; a licence to tip will be spent; freehold land will of course continue to belong to the taxpayer; it will be suitable for grazing or as amenity land but for little if anything else, and its value will be very low compared with the original value—in effect it will have only a small residual value."</p></blockquote>
The Opposition are not clear about the value of the land. We understand that that is a capital value, and so tax concessions cannot be given by allowing the cost to be offset against corporation tax. There may be concession under capital tax legislation, but that is all. That is what the appeal was over. I trust that clause 69 will not allow any sale of land to be included in a revenue transaction and offset against corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Financial Secretary cannot confirm that fact, I hope that the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) can, as he must have done his homework on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to Lord Justice Dillon, but I hope that he is not forgetting Lord Justice Russell and Lord Justice Mann, who agreed with the remarks of Lord Justice Dillon in their entirety and had nothing to add to them. I should however, like my hon. Friend to touch on the history of the judgment, even though it was only on the 4, 5
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
and 6 April 1989. Science in reclamation and toxicity is moving forward at a rapid pace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend, with his knowledge of chemistry, examine the figures in the Dillon judgment? I refer to the infill site's life being seven years and its effective life being four years? We are considering highly toxic chemical waste and waste with properties about which we are unsure. There is nuclear waste, too, although I accept that that does not apply in this instance. We are discovering the interaction between various chemicals daily. Even the clay lid used for capping these bins may lead to further chemical problems. While treating the Dillon judgment with all the respect that it deserves, will my hon. Friend none the less accept that it is very much a moveable feast in terms of the chemical reactions that may take place 10, 20 or 30 years from now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises many matters, but I am not qualified to make judgments that would be worth listening to by anyone else. As I said, my knowledge of chemistry is rudimentary, so I must leave those judgments to someone else. Although I referred to Lord Justice Dillon, the judgment was made in the Court of Appeal by Lord Justices Dillon, Russell and Mann. In page 462 of "Simon's Tax Cases", Lord Justice Dillon states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Accordingly, for my part, I would dismiss this appeal."</p></blockquote>
Lord Justice Russell states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I agree and there is nothing that I can usefully add."</p></blockquote>
Lord Justice Mann states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I agree and there is nothing I can usefully add."</p></blockquote>
I stand corrected by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen). I should have referred to the Lord Justices of Appeal rather than only to Lord Justice Dillon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend correct a misapprehension in the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)? He said that the clause and the amendments did not refer to the disposal of nuclear waste. I understand that British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, which disposes of low-level nuclear waste at a licensed site at Drigg in Cumbria, would be covered by the provisions of the clause and the retrospection that the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) seeks to insert. We are not discussing waste that may be completely innocent in content, but potentially dangerous quantities of waste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Martlew 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carlisle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) mentioned Drigg, which is not far from where I live. Rumour has it that the rabbits who live on the nuclear tip are 5 ft tall. That is incorrect. I spent a long time looking for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue that matter, as rabbits do not pay tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that the Drigg duct will be covered by the tax exemption. People who are not as informed as me have alarmed us about the dangers at Drigg. It is fairly low-level waste, although, initially, it was dumped badly. Much work has gone into Drigg to make it one of the safest nuclear dumps in Europe—if, indeed, there can be a safe nuclear dump.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that rabbits do not pay tax, but many people in South Africa, Australia and elsewhere who, although they do not pay tax to this country, will make up, through their votes, the constitution of future Finance Bill Committees. I am not sure that my hon. Friend was absolutely right. Nevertheless, we should consider the amendments carefully before we reach a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend wants to make progress, but will he consider the reference made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) to "innocent waste"? On reflection, I wonder whether that expression is helpful. I had the pleasure of serving for some time on the Select Committee on the Environment. One of its conclusions was that to talk of "innocent waste" might be misleading, and that we should refer instead to hazardous and non-hazardous waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain circumstances, non-hazardous waste, when mixed with hazardous waste or even purely as a result of chemical processes such as the falling of rain, can become hazardous, so it is not entirely helpful to refer to waste as "innocent", although it is understandable for the lay person to refer to it as such. Will my hon. Friend take that distinction into account in his response to the amendment? My hon. Friend who tabled the amendment—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I must not be beguiled by the smiling face of the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor), but I know that he had in mind when tabling the amendment the distinction between hazardous and non-hazardous waste, because that distinction is constantly in the industry's mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I had hoped that Front Benchers would set a good example to Back Benchers when it came to interventions. The hon. Member's intervention was extremely long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North has made some interesting and enlightening interventions, but none of us can pretend, without turning the truth upside down, that they were short. I am not criticising my hon. Friend, and I beseech him again to make his own speech after I have finished mine. We must get to the bottom of the amendment and get it right. Nothing I have heard this afternoon leads me to believe that we can support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall respond to my hon. Friends who have intervened. I must tread carefully in this matter. I have noted that we shall discuss a Liberal amendment later. It is amendment No. 99, and refers to line 3 of clause 69. It states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"after 'disposal' insert 'or storage'."</p></blockquote>
It would be improper to discuss that amendment now, and I do not intend to do so, but it would enlarge the definition of a "waste disposal site" to include the storage of materials. My hon. Friends' made important interventions because Drigg is not a disposal site, but a storage site.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand to be corrected by my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew), but when I was a member of the Select Committee on the Environment and I visited the Drigg site about four or five years ago, it resembled a municipal rubbish tip rather than a storage site. I am sure that progress has since been made but, in those days, it was very much a tip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall stand by the principle, which I hope you will uphold, Mr. Coleman, that an intervention cannot follow another without the hon. Member who has the Floor uttering a word. However, I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend, on whose words we all hang. I want briefly to follow the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury and to reassure him that some progress has been made, largely as a result of the visit of the Select Committee on the Environment and the interest taken in the matter by its distinguished Chairman and members. The site has been considerably improved, but it is still a place for disposal as opposed to storage, so my hon. Friend's point was well founded. Low-grade nuclear waste is disposed of there, which is commonly the product of hospitals, schools and industrial users. There are many lessons to be learnt from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friends say. I have not been to that area, but I have seen pictures of Drigg. I hope that it is not the case now, but the pictures showed a little river flowing into the sea as a result of that municipal waste tip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is important to the debate on the amendment but, unfortunately, it has raised more questions than answers. If the amendment is accepted, what extra benefits will accrue to BNFL, which I believe is in charge in Cumberland? What will it be able to claim for tax purposes that it could not claim if the amendment of the hon. Member for Esher were not accepted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the intriguing prospect of what could be done if the Liberal amendment were accepted, because it would widen the scope on the Bill even further. I shall not discuss amendment No. 99 because I shall make my speech on it when we reach it, but we cannot forget about it when we are considering this amendment. It bears upon and refers to storage facilities for waste. I do not know whether material can be stored for a week or so before being put on board a ship and moved to a South Pacific island for disposal, or stored somewhere else before
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
being dumped in a clay pit in Bedfordshire, but the amendment would mean that the new tax regime would be applicable to storage as well. More importantly, it would have implications for the nuclear waste disposal and storage industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has opened a new area that needs deep exploration, if that is an appropriate phrase to use in these circumstances. I have a copy of the second report on toxic waste by the Select Committee on the Environment, but do not tangle with my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng). I offer that as friendly advice to my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham. I have read several of the interventions that he made in the Select Committee and they are pertinent. I am sure that he will seek to elaborate on them later but rather than rushing into judgment I have arranged for a messenger to bring me a memorandum of evidence on those matters. It comes from Biotreatment Ltd, Chemical Industries Association Ltd and the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors. It will be found to be the most relevant when it arrives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I trust that that information will be strictly relevant to tax treatment and to the amendment, otherwise I shall come down heavily on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Absolutely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I have been very much on the ball in terms of sticking to the point of the amendment. I shall not laugh or smile; I am not trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes. This is an important and wide-ranging amendment. It is interesting that although the hon. Member for Esher is no doubt waiting to speak and answer our questions, he has not been jumping up and down, saying that he can save the Committee time. If some light had been shed on these matters earlier, perhaps we could have curtailed the debate a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to the judgment of Lord Justices Dillon, Russell and Mann and to page 457 of "Simon's Tax Cases". I should like the hon. Member for Esher to put our minds at rest about the difference between capital and revenue expenditure. Capital expenditure will not be allowed under the new regime set out in clause 69, which is limited to revenue expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend addresses himself to the relevant part of Lord Justice Dillon's judgment, will he bear in mind the effect of the case of Knight v. Calder Grove Estates, which dealt with the distinction between capital and revenue? Even Lord Justice Dillon was minded to refer to it in his judgment. I hope that that has not escaped the notice of my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will take my hon. Friend's advice and deal with that case in a little more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major problems with this type of legislation is deciding what is capital expenditure—
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
that is, what would not fall within the ambit of the amendment or, indeed, clause 69—and what has always been regarded as revenue expenditure, is therefore not changed by the new regime and can be set against corporation tax. It may be imagined that the difference is easy to understand and that there is no problem, but that is not the case. There are people who may not be in the City but who have something in the building society that they call their capital. Once a year, a small sum—interest—is added to that capital, which they can use for revenue expenditure to keep themselves alive. The distinction is easy and there is no need to dwell on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) mentioned the case of Knight 	<i>v.</i> Calder Grove Estates which was in 1954. The lawyers in this Committee must know what the figures 35 TC 447 mean. Will the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) tell us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It refers to tax cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quote from the part of the summing up of Lord Justices Denning et al. upon which clause 69 rests and upon which the hon. Member for Esher has based the amendment in his name. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"	<i>Knight (Inspector v Calder Grove Estates</i> (1954) 35 TC 447 was in fact a decision of Lord Upjohn himself when sitting at first instance. Land there had been acquired for opencast mining and the expenditure on acquiring it was held to be a capital expenditure. The judge rejected an argument that the expenditure was of a revenue nature because it was, and I quote, 'purely transitory'. In 	<i>Regent Oil</i> Lord Reid expressed the view … that the decision in 	<i>Knight v Calder Grove Estates</i> was right, and again I quote: '… because there land was purchased'."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that my hon. Friend wishes to simplify the matter for the Committee and take us through it in a clear and concise way rather than to deal with issues that might be raised by others, but the judgments that he cites which relate directly to the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Esher, deal with the treatment of capital expenditure in the waste disposal industry. We are discussing a Conservative Back Bench amendment, not one tabled by the Opposition. Has my hon. Friend considered that if we accept amendment No. 99 tabled by the Liberal Democrat party, and which relates to waste storage, we shall have to consider all these points again in relation to the waste storage industry? The taxation regime may be different for that industry. We do not even know whether the Liberal Democrats intend to move their amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) will remember that, during the passage of last year's Finance Bill, he nobly stood in for Liberal Democrats and moved their amendments. Has he thought about having to do that again and about how he would deal with the problem of capital taxation of the waste storage industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. What happens to the Liberal Democrat amendment is not relevant.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always welcome the terse and pithy speeches of the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), but the time has come to draw attention to the fact that three hours has been devoted to two amendments which deal with the time at which the clause should begin to be effective. What is the reason for this sustained filibuster? I was led to believe that it was to punish my hon. Friends who spoke for slightly more than one hour on clause 66, which took a total of two and half hours. Are we to assume that one word from my hon. Friends requires three words of reply from Opposition Members? Do Opposition Members consider that the clause is trivial and should, therefore, be treated in a trivial way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It seems to me that there is an infectious disease of long interventions floating around the Committee. My strictures apply as much to the Government Front Bench as to the Opposition
