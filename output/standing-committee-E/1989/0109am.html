<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service and Community Care Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Dame Janet. I was not in the Committee Room at the end of our last sitting—I am also serving on the Coal Industry Bill Committee—when I understand that Members declared interests. I discussed my case with the Registrar of Members' Interests, who advised me that I have no direct interest in this Bill. To avoid doubt, however, I mentioned that Lazard Brothers and Company Ltd. and Scope Communications Management Ltd., the two companies that I advise, occasionally act for clients who may have interests in the health industry.<br><br>
I declare another indirect interest: my wife is a junior hospital doctor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I am sorry to have to return to a matter that I raised at our last sitting, but I intend to persist with it, if necessary on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
During the recess, I made further inquiries into the matter. At our sitting on 19 December, I raised two issues on a point of order relating to Members' private interests and to the rules that the Prime Minister is required to enforce in relation to ministerial interests.<br><br>
I raised the issue of investment placed by financial intermediaries on behalf of Ministers without their knowledge. I quoted a case which arose some five weeks ago in which I said that I believed a Secretary of State had been unreasonably treated by the national media.<br><br>
I raised the matter of Ministers' current interests, which arose from an intervention by the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who said that he had divested himself of his interests. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I sold all interest in my company well before the last general election. I have no further interest in it".—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 19 December 1989; c.37.] </p></blockquote>
Ministers often declare interests. A highly principled Minister in the Scottish Office — the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)—declared an interest in some housing during the Housing (Scotland) Bill Committee on 21 January 1988. He is an honourable man and he declared that interest even though he thought that he did not have to do so.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary said that he had severed all his interests in the company. He referred to a date prior to the general election. The company accounts for his company do not reveal that; they reveal that six days after the general election, he resigned his directorship of, that company. During the period up until his resignation date, which is recorded as 16 June in those company accounts, he is shown as receiving not only a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
director's salary but a chairman's salary or allowance. Therefore, what is recorded in <i>Hansard</i> for that date in relation to our Committee proceedings is not strictly correct. No doubt the Minister will have an explanation for that.<br><br>
The problem, based on the extensive work that I have done, is that Michael Forsyth Ltd is acting in the market as if it is connected to a Minister of the Crown. It trades in his name. When a director of the company was asked about that one and a half years ago by Mr. Robin Dunwoodie of <i>The Scotsman,</i> he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is quite simple. We purchased the company about 12 months ago from Michael before he became a Minister, and we purchased the name of the company. That was part of the assets — there wasn't any point in buying it if we didn't buy the name".</p></blockquote>
Then there was reference to a forthcoming conference. The journalist asked the director:
<br><blockquote><p>"Wasn't this trading deliberately on the name of a Minister?"</p></blockquote> The director replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am not prepared to comment any further on that".</p></blockquote>
We have a Minister in this Committee who may not have a direct pecuniary interest in a particular company at this stage; I shall come to that in a moment. But in Scotland, and perhaps in other parts of the country, that company is trading on his name. In discussions with Companies House in private yesterday, we were told that it would not now be possible to register a company in the name of any Minister if it could be seen that the intention was to use that Minister's name in the conduct of business. Therefore, I begin to question the right of this Minister to sit on this Bill.<br><br>
Committee Members may be interested to learn this. I am informed that the resignation was seen in the trade as only temporary while the hon. Gentleman remains a Minister or is a Member of the House of Commons. The general view in the trade is that if the Minister were no longer a Minister or did not hold his seat, he would be reappointed and could acquire new shares.<br><br>
Daily contact with the company is kept through the Minister's secretary, a Mrs. Griselda Hayes, who, I understand, works for the Minister in the House of Commons at his parliamentary desk. Griselda Hayes is married to a man — <i>[Interruption.]</i> — who purchased half the shares in Michael Forsyth Ltd when the Minister became a Minister. So there is a direct link between the company and the Minister.<br><br>
Michael Forsyth Ltd is now owned by two gentlemen, a Mr. Robertson and a Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes's wife sits as secretary at the Minister's parliamentary desk — or she did until a few months ago. No doubt the Minister will clarify the matter. The House of Commons and Members' interests computer shows her to be his secretary. The House of Commons switchboard regards her as his secretary. She is on answerphone this morning in that name, so perhaps I am wrong. But she is the wife of the man who bought half the shares in the company.<br><br>
Any member of this Committee who writes to a Minister might put the letter on the letter board downstairs. I might wish to write to the Minister about privatisation or particular contracts in Scotland. I have a list of contracts in Scotland that have been given to private companies. The list includes companies that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
have been represented by Michael Forsyth Ltd either directly or through various privatisation — interested associations.<br><br>
If I write to the Minister and my correspondence is not addressed in the proper way, it will probably arrive on the desk of a Mrs. Griselda Hayes who, I am sure, is a perfectly nice woman. But is the relationship between the Minister and me compromised when my correspondence passes over the desk of the wife of a director of a company that is trading in the name of the Minister? I believe that this matter is of great importance.<br><br>
There is a way out. The Minister should give an undertaking to the Committee that he will not, on either losing his seat or his ministerial post, acquire—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —in either his—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am calling for order. When I do so I expect to be obeyed immediately.<br><br>
We are now going way beyond any possible point of order for the Chair. It is points of order for the Chair that concern me. Let me make it clear: it is the responsibility of a Member to declare any direct pecuniary interest that he may have. We cannot enter into the realms of speculation, as the hon. Member is now doing. If there is a vote and it is challenged on the ground of a direct pecuniary interest then we deal with it through a motion.<br><br>
The hon. Member has made his points fully and if the Minister who has been named wishes to make a statement, I shall take it now. If he does not, that is entirely a matter for him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it might help the Committee and enable us to get on with our proceedings if I deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours).<br><br>
I shall make the same point that I made previously when I refuted the view then put forward by the hon. Gentleman. Had he taken the opportunity to talk to me beforehand I could have saved the Committee time and the hon. Gentleman embarrassment in respect of his facts. I told the Committee when it first met that I had sold my interest in Michael Forsyth Associates before the general election. The hon. Gentleman, presumably, can distinguish between being a shareholder and being a director. It is certainly correct that I resigned as a director of Michael Forsyth Ltd and Michael Forsyth Associates on my appointment as a Minister. Therefore, no conflict of interests exists.<br><br>
With regard to Mrs. Hayes, if the hon. Gentleman had done a little more research he would have discovered that Mrs. Hayes recently had a baby and has not been working in the House of Commons. In fact, my correspondence is dealt with in Scotland. Therefore none of these things causes a conflict of interests. I have always been scrupulous in declaring my interests and in making sure that there is no conflict of interest of any kind.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Workington will accept what I have said. The fact that he seeks to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
digress on a Bill of such importance indicates, perhaps, the poverty of the Opposition's case against our reforms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I believe, and am reliably informed, that an undertaking has been given by the directors of the company to the Minister that he has the right to reacquire shares, or to acquire new shares, and to be reappointed to the company if he loses his seat or his ministerial post. The Committee needs an undertaking, before it discusses the Bill—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is totally out of order. No Committee could make such a requirement; it is not required in the House. If the hon. Member wishes to have some sort of new arrangement it must not be pursued here. We have to operate the rules as they are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Couchman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) and for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) quite properly indicated their interest in this important Bill by virtue of their sponsorship by the National Union of Public Employees. Is the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) going to declare his interest in the Confederation of Health Service Employees? That union has at least as much interest in the procedures here and in the Bill as do the hon. Members who are sponsored by NUPE. I am aware that the Register of Members' Interests says that the hon. Gentleman receives no personal remuneration, but this is a declarable financial sponsorship gift. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman, who seems to carry such a heavy burden of conscience for all members of the Committee, will declare his own interest.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cambell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to his own comments. Addressing the Chair, he said at our first sitting:
<br><blockquote><p>"I spoke with you before the Committee began its sittings. Dame Janet. You suggested that you would prefer to take declarations of interest between the sittings motion and the procedural motions which are the substantive part of the debate on the Bill." —[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 19 September 1989: c.37.]</p></blockquote>
When we come to that point, I shall take appropriate action.<br><br>
You said, Dame Janet, that the Committee is not in a position to seek undertakings from the Minister. If that is so, perhaps I may ask the Minister whether he will give an undertaking that on losing either his seat or a ministerial post, he will not acquire, in his name or his wife's, stock in Michael Forsyth Ltd or any company connected by way of—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I regard that as totally out of order. I advise the Minister not to answer it because that, too, would be out of order. — [Interruption.] Order. I have said that that is not a matter for the Chair and I do not expect to have—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who will take the action then?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the hon. Gentleman is so keen that every absolute rule and convention be observed, I remind him that seated interjections when the Chairman is on her feet are not in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You say, Dame Janet, that the Committee is not in a position to extract such an undertaking, that you also are not and that I should not try; and you advised the Minister not to reply. However, the point remains: will the Minister re-acquire his interest in the shares of the company in future? If he does, and any benefit accrues to the value of the company between now and that future juncture, that is a pecuniary interest. I feel that the Minister should make a statement on the issue today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The rule is that it be a direct pecuniary interest. This could not be a direct pecuniary interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Workington has thrown back at me words that I uttered at our first sitting. At the end of that sitting, which was interrupted by the call to adjourn at 1 pm, we were declaring our various interests in the Bill and a number of Opposition Members had declared such interests. Before the hon. Gentleman began speaking this morning, Dame Janet, you began to call the Committee to order to discuss the Bill. I took it then that the hon. Gentleman was not about to declare his interest in COHSE. Surely it is entirely proper for the Committee to be aware that the man who holds this great weight of conscience for everyone else should have such a lightweight conscience when his own interests are involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. David Hinchliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. It is important that we clear up this issue as it raises a number of important principles which cause me concern.<br><br>
The Bill has been presented to us as a package of organisational change. However, underpinning it is a clear attempt to move services that previously were public services out to the market. Those who will benefit directly from the Bill's provisions are a number of private companies which provide cleaning, catering and portering services. Indeed, a number of areas will benefit directly from the proposals, and not only in the Health Service.<br><br>
In community care, we are moving towards self-management units in local authorities, so we shall see privatisation of the home-help services and increasing privatisation of the residential care service, which is becoming a huge business, with many companies being quoted on the stock exchange.<br><br>
My point of order relates to the fact that it is clear from the evidence given by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) that the Minister could benefit directly from the provisions of the Bill through his connections, which could be resumed either when he is no longer a Minister or when he loses his seat, with a company connected with Pritchard Services and with others that are benefiting from privatisation. So, with great respect, Dame Janet, I submit that the matter needs to be clarified at the outset.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to operate the rules as they are, and I am quite clear in my own mind that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
interest could not be regarded as a direct pecuniary interest, as I understand it and as we operate the system now. If any attempts are made to change the way in which we operate, they cannot be made through this Committee; they should be made by other means, not during the Committee stage of a Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I wrote to a Minister some years ago about domestics' pay and conditions within the authority for which I worked. If I write to a Minister today and my letter is opened by his secretary who is married to a major competitor, am I expected to take it on trust that there would be no connection? I think that there would be. In the letter that I wrote, I gave many details of domestic contracts, and the public should know for certain that there can be no connection. Is there any difference between a deferred interest, whereby a person has a monetary gain ultimately, and a pecuniary interest? If there is such a difference, I cannot see it.<br><br>
Two of my colleagues are councillors in the Calderdale area, one of whom has been fined in court for not declaring an interest; in fact, it was against his own interest, but he was still fined. I cannot go into details about the other colleague, who is awaiting a court hearing, but nothing has been gained in either instance. In the first case, as I said, it was against my colleague's interest because the matter arose over an improvement area which he voted against, although his property would have benefited from it. He was still fined. It is a cockeyed law that does that. I cannot believe that the public will be happy about the Minister's silence and dodging.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister made his statement. He says that he has no direct pecuniary interest, and he has made that quite clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to come back on this, Dame Janet, but I think that you are looking at the wrong rules. There are two completely different rules. I have sat for two years on the Select Committee on Members' Interests (Declaration), and I am sure that you will accord me the right at least to know what the distinction is. There are rules that apply to Ministers, and the Prime Minister is responsible for overseeing and monitoring their operation, and there are rules that apply to Members of Parliament. It may well be that the Minister falls within the parliamentary rules: I have never contested that. The Minister himself rose during my intervention on 12 December 1989, or whenever it was, to say that he was not dealing with the point that I was raising.<br><br>
I am dealing with the ministerial rules, and I have a copy with me. They are entitled:
<br><blockquote><p>"Royal Commission on Standards of Conduct in Public Life</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Ministers' Private Interests</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Memorandum by the Secretary of the Cabinet</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>1. The Commission have asked for evidence on the regulation of private financial and business interests of Ministers of the Crown."</p></blockquote>
It then sets out the principles:
<br><blockquote><p>"The principles which should guide Ministers in deciding whether they may properly continue to hold Company Directorships and similar offices have been stated".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not to do with the Committee or anything for which I have any responsibility, and I must call a halt to it now.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that 1 intend to persist, Dame Janet, because I believe that I have a right to do so. The rules say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Ministers must so order their affairs".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the hon. Gentleman to sit down. This is as far as I can take the matter, because I can deal with it only in so far as it affects members of the Committee. The hon. Gentleman is raising issues that go far beyond that. Certainly, he is at liberty to pursue them in other ways, but I am afraid that that is it, as far as this Committee is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. You referred to direct interests in your ruling. I put it to you that it does not refer to direct interests; it deals with the question that<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"Ministers must so order their affairs that no conflict arises, or appears to arise".</p></blockquote>
That is not a direct interest, but it may exist in the public mind. The fact that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has an agreement that he may in future return to a company that is trading in his name in an area for which he has departmental responsibility could lead to suspicion in the public mind; and you should rule on it, Dame Janet, in the light of the rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, that set of principles or rules relates to matters that lie outside the Committee and the House with regard to Members of Parliament. Therefore, I cannot allow the hon. Member to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. You say that the matter rests outside the House. The answer to the problem is to suspend the Committee until the Prime Minister—<i>[Interruption.]</i> These are important matters, and if Conservative Members do not believe me, they should ask the general public what they think. The Prime Minister should rule on whether she is satisfied that no conflict arises or appears to arise between the Minister's private interests and his public duties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made the points clear. I also have an overriding duty as Chairman to ensure that matters are dealt with as expeditiously as possible. Does the Under-Secretary wish to make a further point? After that I must call an end to the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman's thesis is that there is an arrangement between me and Michael Forsyth Ltd, or Michael Forsyth Associates, that will enable me to acquire shares in the event of my losing my seat, which is highly unlikely, or of my wishing to go back into business. There is no such arrangement, and the premise upon which the hon. Gentleman has wasted the past 25 minutes of the Committee's time is false.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. The Minister did not reply to my point. He referred to the loss of his seat; I referred to loss of ministerial post. I know that there is not an agreement in writing; the agreement takes another form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have said that I do not regard that as a proper point for the Minister to reply to.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook <span class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. As you will be aware, on Thursday the House will debate the ambulance dispute, which is of especial concern to many members of the Committee, a number of whom always seek to intervene in my speeches. I believe that discussions have taken place about the convenience of the Committee not sitting on Thursday afternoon. May we get on record what arrangements have been reached?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is strictly not a matter for the Chairman, who is the servant of the Committee with regard to times of sittings. But I have no doubt that what are described as "the usual channels" will have some arrangements in mind. One usual channel coming up?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greg Knight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. There have been discussions through the usual channels, and it has been agreed that the Committee will not sit on Thursday afternoon. Someone from the ministerial Bench will so move on Thursday morning on the basis that we sit beyond 7pm this evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to return to my point of order, Dame Janet. The Minister has still not told us that he will not acquire or re-acquire shares in, or seek to be a director of, Michael Forsyth Ltd at some stage in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already said that I do not regard—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sit down. I have already said that I do not regard that as a point of order for the Minister to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. The Minister knows that when the public read about our proceedings they will wonder why he refused to give an undertaking to the Committee on the matter.<br><br>
If he seeks to rejoin the company that he has left, which is trading in matters relating to his ministerial responsibility, he stands to be a beneficiary.<br><br>
I persist, Dame Janet: the Minister should be required to give an undertaking. If he does not, the Committee's proceedings should be suspended until the matter is cleared up. People in Scotland want to know why the Minister is sitting on the Committee, and I have come to the Committee today to find out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. The Bill is one of the most important measures to be considered by the House this year. The National Health Service employs more than 1 million people, and all members of the Committee use it. We have now spent half an hour on an entirely bogus point of order. Members of the press have come to hear about the National Health Service, not to hear this nonsense. My hon. Friend the Minister has given the clearest undertaking, so may we please get on with our business?</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must move to the Committee's business. I am not prepared to take any more.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. The Minister can get us out of this corner. All he has to do is to tell the Committee that he will not—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is out of order. I again invite him to sit down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Cambell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to press the point of order, Dame Janet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not prepared to take a further point of order on the matter.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'> Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspend th Committee for 10 minutes.</span></p>
<p>11.2 am</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
<p>11.13 am</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. It is wrong of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) to detain the Committee in this way.<br><br>
I used the opportunity of the adjournment to ring Michael Forsyth Ltd, which I have not done for a long time. I spoke to one of the directors who told me that none of the company's clients is in any way involved in health matters. I know that the hon. Gentleman is basing his view of Pritchard Services on the "Public Relations Yearbook", but Pritchard Services no longer exists as a company as it was taken over by Initial some years ago. The hon. Gentleman is labouring under yet
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
another misapprehension. He was pressing me to assure the Committee that there was no formal link of the kind that he said existed. He told the Committee that there was an arrangement whereby if I ceased to be a Minister or a Member of Parliament I could acquire shares—presumably at a value that would enable me to gain from an improved share value—or become a director. I have no recollection of such an arrangement. I have checked with one of the directors of the company, and there is no such recollection. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his comments and allow the Committee to continue.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Once again the Minister has carefully avoided replying precisely to what I said. I asked for an undertaking that he would not seek to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already said that the hon. Member should not ask that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. The "Public Relations Yearbook", 1989 refers to Pritchard Services, which is a major company in the area that is subject to privatisation. It is linked, as the Under-Secretary said, to Initial, which has a string of Scottish contracts. I have a list of them, and there are eight contacts in Glasgow alone. The Minister has already admitted the link. He said that Initial does not act for Pritchards, but the return that was filled in by Michael Forsyth Ltd includes Pritchard Services under the heading:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any clients not served on a continuing basis for whom ad hoc assignments were carried out during the last year".</p></blockquote>
In 1989, Michael Forsyth Ltd declared Pritchard Services as one of its ad hoc clients. I rest my case. Will the Minister give an undertaking that he will not seek to re-acquire shares or a directorship in Michael Forsyth Ltd in the event of his ceasing to be a Minister or losing his seat at the next general election, or at any other time? Will he give a long-term, indefinite assurance that there will be no links in the future between him or any member of his family and Michael Forsyth Ltd? If he will not give that assurance he may well be —</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are back to the point that I ruled was not a matter for the Committee or for the Chair to decide, and certainly not a matter to which the Minister need reply. The case must rest there, and we must turn to the substantive business of the Committee. We have not yet reached the first clause or amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Dame Janet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it the same point of order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hereby declare that I receive no personal remuneration from the Confederation of Heath Service Employees. I receive no income or expenses—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Election expenses?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All moneys paid by COHSE are paid to my constituency party. Furthermore, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
object to the rules whereby Members of Parliament are required to declare sponsorship when no money is paid to them personally, while some Members receive, through their constituency associations, large sums of money from local companies, which do not have to be declared in the Register of Members' interests. That is an inequality and the register should be reformed. If Conservative Members are not required to declare contributions to be used for political purposes paid to their constituency associations from companies in their constituencies, Labour Members should not be required to declare sponsorship. I declare sponsorship under protest, believing that we are being unequally treated.<br><br>
I return to the issue of a Member of Parliament gaining in his back pocket—gaining directly, in my view; I had time to consider it during the 10-minute suspension. The Minister was asked repeatedly to give an undertaking that he will not have any connections with the company in the future, and I hope that the public will hear and see what is happening. The Minister persistently refused to give that undertaking. The company is directly involved in promoting privatisation. I have documents relating to contracts that it has undertaken; I know its clients and what meetings, conferences and seminars it has arranged. I know its business. It trades in the name of a Minster who refuses to sever future connections with it. What is happening in the Committee today is wrong. I shall press the matter until the Minister is removed from the Committee. He should not sit on the Committee: he knows that and so do I. If he gives Labour Members the undertaking that we require, I shall resume my seat and we can discuss the Bill. If he does not do so, I shall continue to press for the matter to be resolved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that such an undertaking is not required by the rules under which we operate. I cannot, therefore, let the matter go further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span> </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it in order for an hon. Member to make a tape recording of his remarks in Committee? Surely the rules of the House do not allow that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of such a recording. I trust that nothing is going on that is out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I am sorry to press the matter—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is pursuing the same point, I must tell him that in my opinion the matter has been dealt with and we should therefore move on. I request that he resumes his seat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point or order. Dame Janet. I am not prepared to give way now because the issue is one of great principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I do not believe that you called the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) or acknowledged his point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I requested the hon. Gentleman to resume his seat. Will he please sit down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman took his seat, but I do not believe that you called him, Dame Janet. I beg to move, that the Committee do now adjourn.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
The effect of my motion, if it is accepted by the Committee, would be that we would adjourn and resume our proceedings at 4.30 pm. During our adjournment, I shall approach my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House and consider raising the matter on the Floor of the House at 3.30 pm.<br><br>
I understand, Dame Janet, that you have no powers to require the hon. Gentleman to be suspended from the Committee. Mr. Speaker will be told at 3.30 pm that the hon. Member for Workington has been barracking the Chair with points of order and has refused to resume his seat when required to do so, he refused to desist from pursuing an argument that he was told repeatedly was out of order. In effect, he uttered threats by saying that he would not allow the Committee to begin proceedings on the Bill unless and until my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who is devoid of any criticism, is withdrawn from the Committee. That is a serious matter which must be raised with the Speaker at 3.30 pm. I trust that Mr. Speaker will be able to ensure that the other members of the Committee can resume the proceedings at 4.30 pm and get on with discussion of the Bill.<br><br>
In view of what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, I make it clear that while I accept that the matter is entirely for the hon. Member for Workington, who acts in collusion with no one and is beyond the control of his colleagues and anyone else, our agreement not to sit on Thursday afternoon cannot proceed if a Back Bench Member ensures that we lose all our proceedings on Tuesday morning. That will no doubt be discussed further by the usual channels.<br><br>
I do not intend to intervene further on the irrelevant point that has been raised but the remarks of the hon. Member for Workington about his COHSE sponsorship were disingenuous.<br><br>
There is nothing wrong with his sponsorship, but other Members declare their sponsorship. He has a direct interest in furthering COHSE's cause however, because it pays for his election expenses. The idea that it is a matter of no concern to the hon. Gentleman is one which, frankly, I do not believe. In America, people would be astounded to hear that a Congressman was somehow wholly detached from all the backers who pay the necessary expenses to get him re-elected. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) said, the interpretations of the hon. Member for Workington of the conscience of the House are highly selective and somewhat bizarre.<br><br>
The final revelation was to discover that the hon. Gentleman was taping his lengthy interventions. Obviously, he does not even trust himself when he is on his feet. He ought now to desist but it is plain that he will not. Therefore, I beg to move, that further consideration be now adjourned. I hope that we can resume our proceedings in a more sensible and intelligent fashion at 4.30 pm today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I respond to the motion, I should say, for the avoidance of doubt, that I am sponsored by the National Union of Railwaymen. I am not aware that it organises any members in the Health Service, but I shall take the precaution of checking during the adjournment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
The Secretary of State said that he intends to raise the matter on the Floor of the House this afternoon. I think that all sides of this dispute would agree that that is the correct course to take. Irrespective of the narrow point of order, the Opposition believe that there is a point of substance which requires wider ventilation and may require a higher authority for advice. Therefore, we do not propose to object to the motion.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
Perhaps I may assure the Secretary of State that if on any future occasion he wishes to adjourn the proceedings on the Bill, we shall be happy to accommodate him.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p>Adjourned accordingly at twenty-six minutes past Eleven o'clock till this day at half-past Four o'clock.</p>
