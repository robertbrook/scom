	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service and Community Care Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross and Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. On Tuesday evening we debated aspects of the Bill affecting Scotland, particularly the Scottish health boards. The hon. Members for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) and I all spoke. The Minister with responsibilities for health in Scotland replied to our questions. However, we read in some of yesterday's Scottish newspapers that on the same day, elsewhere, the Minister made an important statement about two Scottish health boards that would be involved in pilot schemes. The schemes are relevant to the national health service that the Bill will create in Scotland. As we had been debating that issue, would not it have been more courteous to the Committee for the Minister to have given us that information during Tuesday's sitting, rather than leave his announcement until the next day? It would have been relevant to the discussion then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. However, If the Minister would like to make a brief comment, he may do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The press release that the hon. Gentleman referred to was about the operation of contracts in two pilot schemes for health boards; it had nothing to do with the membership and composition of health boards, which we discussed on Tuesday. We shall discuss the operation of contracts later. It was important that an announcement was made as soon as the schemes were completed. The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) will be able to discuss that and other matters later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Would it be possible to expedite the publication of the evidence that the Secretary of State for Health gave to the Select Committee on Social Services yesterday? What the Minister told that Committee has a great bearing on our consideration of the Bill. He made statements that have not been brought before this Committee, and are not therefore known to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chairman. If the hon. Member would like to make representations to the Chairman or Clerk of the relevant Select Committee, it would be in order for him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand, Dame Janet, that it is not a matter for you, but we shall be debating matters this afternoon that relate directly to the evidence that the Minister gave yesterday. The Bill is being driven through Parliament. I believe that the Committee should see the
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
report of what the Minister said to the Select Committee in reply to questions from the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard what the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said, but I can deal only with matters that relate to my responsibilities as Chairman of this Committee. There is a way for the hon. Member to deal with the matter, but it is not through me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I appreciate the care with which you phrased your ruling on the point of order, raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). Nevertheless, I am sure that you recognise that it is reasonable. Would it not be appropriate for you to pass on the request from members of the Committee, as that might carry more weight and might, therefore, expedite publication of the report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is beyond my power, but the point has been clearly stated and I am sure that ears will be listening. I cannot take the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Jerry Hayes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. My hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) and I were present at the Select Committee hearing yesterday. If Opposition Members wish to know what the Secretary of State said, we shall happily tell them, and make representations to the Chairman of the Select Committee so that this Committee may receive a transcript of the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of the amendments—certainly those standing in my name and in the names of my hon. Friends —have the same objectives. I assure the Under-Secretary that they have been tabled in a spirit of helpfulness, and with the anxious hope of improving the Bill. We hope for a similarly helpful and positive response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments address twin problems. Clause 3 sets out the primary duties and functions of district health authorities, and is the only clause in the Bill to do so. I invite Committee members, all of whom have read the clause in detail, to reflect on what it tells us about those duties and functions, and to put themselves in the position of a visitor from Mars who, with no knowledge of the National Health Service, is confronted with clause 3. Such a person would discover that the functions and duties of DHAs are to place contracts, because, according to clause 3, that, and nothing else, is their sole responsibility. It mentions no obligations to ensure standards or types of medical care, but merely an obligation to place contracts on behalf of the resident population. Those on the Treasury Bench think that they need stipulate only that health authorities should place contracts. That is a striking testimony to their confidence in commercial contracts as a way of securing public service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first problem, therefore, relates to the minimum health provision expected of DHAs. The second problem addressed by the amendments is the absence in the Bill of any reference to the core services, which were debated extensively during discussions on the White Paper. Committee members will remember that core services were presented in the White Paper as the basis on which existing specialties and provisions of hospital treatment would be protected. Given the importance that Ministers attached to core services every time they were interrogated in the House and in public, it is striking that there is nothing in either the clauses or schedules that insists that core services be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
The amendments seek to solve both problems, by defining the functions of the DHAs and thus simultaneously imposing on them the need to preserve core services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend been informed whether the model contracts to be drawn up have been made available to the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has asked a pertinent question. I have not seen any model contracts, though they have been circulated. I should not be surprised to find my hon. Friend ahead of me in the matter, and if he has seen one of them I should welcome his sharing it with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend know that yesterday during evidence to the Select Committee on Social Services reference was made to model contracts? Therefore they exist, and should be made available to help the Committee's discussion. If they are not, that would reveal that the Government do not want us to have an informed debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the advantage of the hon. Members for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) and for Maidstone (Miss Widdicombe), who attended the Select Committee yesterday. But as my hon. Friend says, this Committee is debating district health authorities and the contracts that they will place one with another in the context of clause 3, and of clause 4, which deals specifically with contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Workington that if evidence about material contracts has been given to the Select Committee, it should be made available to this Committee. My hon. Friend will remember that there is a provision albeit a dead-letter one, for a Standing Committee first to meet as a Special Standing Committee before considering a Bill. It is a matter of regret that we were not given that opportunity to call just such evidence. No doubt the hon. Member for Harlow will be happy to accept—possibly he will be unable to resist—the opportunity to participate in the debate and share with us the evidence that was given yesterday. A leak from the hon. Member for Harlow would constitute a refreshing reversal of our roles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have sought to define health authority contracts and to provide legislative backing for the core services by stipulating in the amendments that each one should be provided by health authorities. Amendment No. 189 would ensure that accident and emergency services were provided by the health authority. Amendment No. 202 refers to general medicine; amendment No. 203 to geriatrics; amendment No. 204 to psychiatry; amendment No. 208 to public health; and amendment No. 209 to community health services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary objects that it is too cumbersome to list each core service separately, we have offered the alternative—it is a multiple choice question —of amendment No. 207, in which all the services are rolled together in a single subsection. The Under-Secretary cannot reasonably object to listing the core services that should be provided by district health authorities, because they have been lifted from the White Paper. I expect an unusual degree of harmony and cross-party unity in the Committee on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have embroidered the list of core services a little by widening it to include the two most conspicuous omissions from the list published in the White Paper. We include
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
maternity services as a core service in amendment No. 206. The Committee should note that when the White Paper listed the core services, it mentioned services that "need guaranteed local access." There is a similar reference in working paper 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working papers are intended to provide the technical detail necessary to back up the White Paper. However, the working paper's paragraph on core services provides less technical detail than the original White Paper. One lobby organisation observed that it is a striking case of a contract's small print being printed in larger type than the initial document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In working paper 1 the statement is further expanded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Core services are those which must be provided locally".</p></blockquote>
It is unlikely that, had he been a woman, the Secretary of State for Health would have commited himself to the proposition that maternity services were not among the services that must be provided locally. For convenient ante-natal care for pregnant women—some of whom will be heavily pregnant—and access to the delivery room for women in labour, it is vital that maternity services be provided locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had in the House a number of exchanges and debates on the ambulance dispute. I do not wish to put myself on the wrong side of the Chair by elaborating on them, but one point that has been mentioned is that too often ambulance staff have to carry out deliveries at the kerbside because they do not have time to get to the maternity hospital. If we do not oblige district health authorities to provide local maternity services, such deliveries are likely to become more common.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that there will be some cross-party agreement on this. I hope that some Conservative Members will support the amendment because nothing gives rise to greater anxiety in rural areas than the withdrawal of local maternity services. I also hope that the amendment will not be resisted by the Minister. I noticed a quotation in the Nottingham 	<i>Evening Post,</i> which took the matter up. It obtained a comment from a spokesperson at the Department of Health, who said that maternity services had not ben excluded by Ministers; they had merely forgotten about them. We have now reminded Ministers and we hope that maternity services will be accepted as a core service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other addition that we seek to make, in amendment No. 205, is the paediatric service. It is important that paediatric services be provided locally. It is in the nature of the paediatric service that it caters for young children and it is natural for young children in hospital to be distressed and anxious. They are in unfamiliar surroundings. It is important to them and their parents that the parents, especially the mother, have access to them. Young children in hospital tend to have mothers who have young children at home as well. The difficulty for young mothers visiting children in hospital is compounded by the fact that during the daytime the husband is likely to have the car to travel to work. My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) will forgive me, I am sure, for parading a stereotype, but unfortunately it is typical of many young families.

I speak with some feeling on the subject as we have had a long campaign in my constituency to bring in paediatric services from Edinburgh. One of my constituents gave birth to twins, one of whom had to be taken into intensive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
care in Edinburgh and the other of whom was discharged. She found herself for three months with one infant at home and the other in a hospital 20 miles away by road and one and three quarter hours away by public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I go round the country and meet district general managers and discuss closures of units with them, I find that they can almost always give me, to the last 10th of a mile, the distance between the unit that is closed and the unit that replaces it. I also invariably find that when I ask them how many changes of bus are involved in that journey, they cannot tell me. Decisions about closure and the placing of contracts are made by people who frequently use cars. Their decisions affect the way in which health is delivered to people who have no easy access to private transport. That is why it is important that paediatric services also be provided locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may not wish to resist this contention, because when my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham effectively exposed the importance of paediatrics being a core service, the then Minister for Health the hon. and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor), appeared on television that night to say how grateful he was to my hon. Friend for giving him the opportunity to say that paediatrics would be a core service. We look forward to hearing that assurance not simply on television but in Committee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that it is important that all these core services be listed in the legislation as obligations on district health authorities. The truth is that the invention of the concept of core services by Ministers at the Department of Health is in itself an admission that some specialties will be at risk from the new commercial environment in which the health authorities have to operate. The idea of core services was introduced only as a means of protecting some specialties from being shared as a result of cost pressures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty with the Minister's approach to the problem is that the Government refuse to list those core services by saying that it is up to the local health authority to decide what is needed. Therefore, by definition there cannot be a central core of specialties that are locally defined. That is like the Secretary of State for Education and Science inventing the core curriculum and then saying that the components of the core curriculum should be left to local education authorities. If the idea of core services is to be meaningful, it must be centrally recorded somewhere and laid down. The logical place to do that is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a formidable range of professional medical bodies which take the same view as that which we are advocating in the amendments. They insist that it is not sufficient to leave core services for local determination; it is essential that core services should be stipulated centrally. I shall refer briefly to the impressive number of professional medical organisations which support the contention for their own specialities. For instance, the Royal College of Midwives says that it is essential that maternity services should be a core service; the Royal College of Physicians stresses the need for a full range of care services for chronic medical illness in children and adults; the Royal College of Radiologists stresses the need for core servies in radiodiagnosis; the Royal College of Psychiatrists stresses that core services must include all aspects of psychiatric services; the conference of colleges stressed that a full range of core services must be developed to include obstetrics, paediatrics and the full integrated care of the chronic sick and disabled. Finally, the British
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
Geriatric Society, which combined consultants with people also concerned with geriatrics outside the medical profession, expressed extreme concern that only some geriatric and psychiatric hospital services will be included in the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that powerful expression of medical opinion, the sources of which were never consulted when the White Paper was written, it is important for the Committee, at the very least, to write into the Bill the core services named by Ministers, and subsequently accepted by Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends will understand that as a result of the debates on clause 1, when we discussed membership of the health authorities, and the refusal of the Minister to accept our amendments to clause 1, we are faced with health authorities which are not accountable to local people and which do not represent anyone. Indeed, the Under-Secretary placed particular stress on the importance of them not representing anyone. Therefore, they will have no obligation to consult local authorities about who should be on them or what they should do. They will exist merely to take a corporate view of what specialties they think they should provide to a population by which they were not elected, to which they are not accountable and which they must not represent. In those circumstances, surely it is not sufficient to leave solely to their discretion which core services should be provided for their districts, and in their hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall touch on a technical point which I suspect may form part of the Under-Secretary's response. Each of our amendments stress that a core service should be provided within a district. I anticipate that the Under-Secretary may respond by saying that it will be sufficient for a district health authority to provide for a core service by contract with a nearby hospital. If we can rephrase this to embrace the concept of being approximate, adjacent, or near to, I shall be willing to consider that, but I will look askance at any DHA which claims that it can get by with no maternity services anywhere within its boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to establish the principle that core services preferably be provided in the district or, at the very least, nearby, and that it will not be sufficient—so far as I am aware, it would be technically competent according to the Bill—for the district health authority to place a contract for the provision of a core service with a hospital that is neither within its district nor adjacent to the boundaries of its district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the issue of principle. Hon. Members who have read debates of 1945–48 on the origins of the National Health Service will be aware that they did not turn merely on the importance of a public service rather than a private one; they turned equally on the amazingly uneven provision of hospital care in England, Wales and Scotland at the time, and on the great importance of developing a genuinely national Health Service that would provide hospital services for each community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of a district general hospital providing comprehensive care for most operations that can be undertaken without complications is one of the most important attractions and achievements of the National Health Service. It would be left at risk in a commercial environment, which leaves it open to DHAs to say that it is no longer their function to ensure provision of a local district general hospital and that their function is simply to place contracts on behalf of their resident population, not necessarily within their district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
That would be a great loss to the service provided to patients, in terms of convenience to them. It would mean a loss of partnership between the hospital and the district primary care services. It would represent also a loss of community pride in the service of the local hospital. Most of all, it would mean a loss of choice to patients. It is all very well for Ministers to say that patients should be free to exercise their choice of whether to be served by their local hospital or to go to one some distance away which may be able to treat them more quickly, but that choice can be exercised only if the local hospital provides the specialty. If we are to protect patient choice, we must protect specialties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that all those potential losses are worth avoiding. If the Minister is determined to take the Health Service down the road to commercial contracts and a business-like commercial basis for health care provision, we do not have the vote to prevent him from imposing that on the British people. We have the right to ask him here at least to accept these minimal protections to ensure that specialties are not shed in pursuit of commercial profit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 221 and 222, which stand in my name. Like the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), I preface my remarks by saying that the amendments are designed to be helpful. But as I agree with the policy and thrust of the Bill, perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will accept my assurances more readily than those of the hon. Member for Livingston.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These and others of my amendments seek to write into the Bill assurances that Ministers have already given, or to attempt to reinforce the consumerist thrust of the Bill which is embodied in the documents "Patients First", "Working for Patients" and others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman continues, may I say that there is something of a hum of conversation which makes it difficult for me to hear him? I am sure that it is inadvertent, but it is a little trying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 221 relates to the assessment of need and the consultation that should take place locally before the annual document is published. At present, DHAs and regional health authorities have a responsibility regularly to review the health of the population in their area. This is made clear in departmental circular 88/64. They must also publish an annual report on their population's health. The report is a public document which must be presented formally. So the principle of assessment, consultation and publication has been conceded. The amendment seeks to write that process into the new procedure. I believe that under the new regime, it will be even more important for DHAs and RHAs to carry it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of consultation, the circular to which I referred makes it clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each health authority should … maintain close collaboration with local authorities, FPCs, the HEA and other public and voluntary agencies in matters affecting the health of the public with particular reference to the prevention of disease and the promotion of health." </p></blockquote>
There is not a lot of difference between that and subsection (1B) of my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new regime, the purchase and provision of services will be split, of course. The health authorities will by and large be the purchasers and the provision will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
done under contract. The assessment of need will be much more important under the new regime than it is now, because at present district health authorities have some flexibility to move resources within the year because they are both the purchaser and the provider, but under a regime in which contracts have to be placed at the beginning of the year, there is a loss of flexibility, so one must get those contracts right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have said that under the new regime the district health authorities will be free of the responsibility of providing services so that they may concentrate on their new role, and their speeches show that an important part of that new role is the assessment of need. I have been re-reading a very good speech made on 19 December by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State on the role of district health authorities:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I particularly welcome the opportunity this occasion affords to stress the importance of having strong effective Districts whose primary role will be as the 'patients friends', ensuring their particular needs are identified and then met better than the present system allows. To accomplish this, Districts must carry out some key functions";</p></blockquote>
and he went on to develop that idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the document sent to Committee members, "Contracts for Health Services", the introduction identifies and addresses the key issues arising from the changing role of district health authorities. The new role moves away from planning and managing services for a catchment population towards identifying the service requirements of a resident population, and planning and managing their purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against the background of the new role of district health authorities, I turn to clause 3, which I have read, at the invitation of the hon. Member for Livingston. It is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Primary and other functions of health authorities"</p></blockquote>
There is no reference at all to the assessment of need. "Provision" is mentioned 15 times, and of course that is a responsibility, but "assessment" does not appear at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory and financial memorandum on clause 3 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State proposes to direct that, apart from certain functions such as the provision of accident and emergency services to all who need them, a DHA's primary function will be the exercise of its delegated powers in arranging the provision of services to its resident population."</p></blockquote>
The important strategic role of the assessment of need is again omitted, and I think that if we are to give a signal in this clause to district health authorities about their new role, and restate the Government's philosophy, we should insert in it the role which I have just identified. It is a role to which Ministers obviously attach great importance, because it is in the documents to which I have referred and in many of their speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 221 seeks to do this. It states that the district health authorities must assess need and in so doing consult various people. I hope that the Government will have no disagreement with me in principle about that approach. I am entirely flexible as to how we do it, and because my amendment is written in ordinary English which can be understood I am sure that I will be told that it is technically deficient, unlike the rest of the Bill, which is technically perfect but sometimes difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 222 addresses one of the conflicts inherent in the Government's approach. On the one hand is the consumerist approach of making services more responsive to patients. I very much welcome that approach, as does the Consumers Association in a briefing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
which all Committee members have received. There is also, however, the attempt to develop a damand-oriented approach, as opposed to the current supply-oriented approach. That is one thrust of the Government's policy. On the other hand, there is the internal market approach —the pursuit of efficiency, value for money and the placing of contracts that represent value for money. To go too far down that road involves conflict with the first thrust of convenience for patients. There is a dilemma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to tilt the balance back towards the patient by putting parameters around the placing of out-of-district contracts. The parameters are set out in five paragraphs which, I hope, speak for themselves. The amendment also addresses the political problem that it is widely assumed that health authorities will be free to place contracts out of district simply because they are cheaper. But it is clear to anyone who reads Ministers' speeches that that is not the intention. The paragraph of the speech that I quoted a few moments ago makes it quite clear that the preference will be for local provision. Paragraph 9 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To stay with access for a moment, if Districts are to get the best value and quality, they must be prepared to look outside their own boundaries for some services. Small minded, parochial district sufficiency is a thing of the past. But equally there are some services where easy access is a vital element in the quality equation. Some services will need to be local—for clinical reasons; for the convenience of patients—e.g. because of public transport flows; and because some facilities, screening, immunisation etc. will only be used if they are readily accessible. Many patients are elderly; many are children. Travel is by no means always possible, let alone desirable."</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to embody that philosophy in the Bill. It was a presumption on industry provision that, where it makes sense, provision is made outside the district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendments are slightly more flexible than those moved by the hon. Member for Livingston. His amendments insist on industry provision, though in his closing remarks, I think he recognised the weakness of his case. Certainly within London, industry provision is not as important as local provision, and local provision often happens to be outside the district. A person living in Acton will be closer to Hammersmith hospital—in a different district—than to Ealing hospital—in the same district. Although the hon. Gentleman spoke about local provision, his amendments refer to industry provision. My amendment No. 222 is more acceptable because it is less restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to dwell on core services, as my hon. Friend the Minister seems to have recognised that use of the term "core services" was perhaps incorrect. I incline to the view that a core service is a core service, wherever one lives. If maternity is a core service in one's own area, it is still a core service if one moves to another area. Core is core. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister would care to express core services in another way, because he seemed to imply that core services was the wrong expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to set out procedures for change to the new system. First, it proposes that decisions should be made at district level, and is consistent with amendment No. 221. That is the right level at which to make decisions about where services should be provided. Secondly, it begins from the presumption in favour of local services —at present, that is not in the Bill—and accords with the Government's recognition in paragraph 4.15 of the White Paper that for many important services
	<br><blockquote><p>"patients need guaranteed local access".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
The amendment provides that guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it recognises that notwithstanding that preference, there are many services which can quite properly and sensibly be provided beyond the boundaries of the district. They include specialist treatments, the need for which cannot be justified within a single district, or where it is necessary to develop a regional or, in some instances, a national centre of excellent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the amendment requires that the district health authority should balance, in determining where each category of service should be provided, the benefits of having it outside but more specialised, or having it less specialised but more local. It outlines a process of consultation which I am sure that good district health authorities would wish to do and no doubt already do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there is no disagreement in principle on either amendment. I am entirely flexible as to how to achieve the goals, but in my view they should be written into the Bill if we are to send out the right signals from the Committee and if the Government's proposals are not to be misinterpreted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our first sitting after the Christmas recess, the interests of members of the committee were raised. My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)—he has just left the Committee Room—declared, tongue in cheek, that he had an interest as a Member of Parliament sponsored by the National Union of Railwaymen. But with the possible exception of the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, I suspect that my hon. Friend has more of a vested interest in the Bill than any other member of the Committee. The legislation will force patients to travel far and wide and the NUR will have more interest in it than it realises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston said that the problems facing individual patients and their relatives were not borne in mind when the legislation was drafted. The Bill will mean that patients right, left and centre will have to travel many miles to receive treatment that was previously available closer to home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some years ago I visited a member of my family in hospital about 15 miles from where we lived. I went to see him twice a day for a long time because he was seriously ill. I was fortunate because I had the use of a motor vehicle and had no difficulty in driving to and from the hospital. But many of my constituents who travel to that hospital —Killingbeck, in Leeds, which treats heart patients from Yorkshire—do not have a motor vehicle and may have to take perhaps six buses in getting to and from the hospital. It should not be assumed that the Bill will not inconvenience our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
One of the problems of this place is that hon. Members are unrepresentative of the general public in many respects. I suspect that every member of the Committee has daily use of a car, but many of our constituents, especially women and elderly people, do not. Travelling to and from a hospital is not easy for them. They are forced to use public transport, which in many areas has been decimated by the Government's policies. The Government have underestimated the Bill's implications for patients and their relatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe), who is not in the Committee at present, may refer to the proposals as the Sainsbury philosophy. Conservative Members assume that there is no difference between running a supermarket and running a National Health Service. The Government bring in people from supermarkets to tell them how to run the NHS—the Griffiths report on management in the NHS is an obvious example. The Government appointed someone from Marks and Spencer to tell them how to run a caring service. I am astonished at such a philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implications of that philosophy are evident in the contract system. I refer to the report to Wakefield health authority. I apologise for being parochial, but it is important that we consider how the legislation will affect our constituents. If Conservative Members did that, and listened to their constituents, few of them would vote or speak for the Bill. Paragraph 17 of the district general manager's report to the Wakefield health authority suggests that the entire Health Service in Wakefield should opt out and become a trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hope that that will be noted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a reasonable debate; we are not wasting time. We cannot be accused of delaying the Committee because we refer to the direct implications of the legislation on our constituents. As my hon. Friend said, it is worrying that so many Conservative Members have left the Committee. They clearly have no interest in listening to our arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to paragraph 17 of the report to my health authority which went through on the nod about two weeks ago. I shall read the paragraph because it is relevant to the amendments. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A trust will be able to retain operating surpluses. This power provides a clear advantage since it will allow Trusts to plan ahead and to follow sensible and proven financial policies rather than being constrained by the annual cash limits system which would continue to apply to Managed Units. Surpluses generated can be invested in new assets, used to repay loans, or invested to earn interest."</p></blockquote>
I read the document three times—it is 14 pages long. It mentioned surpluses but there was no reference to unprofitable services that do not generate a surplus. Therein lies the doubt about the future provision for health care in areas such as mine upon which people rely. I want to know what will happen when provisions do not generate a surplus. Such questions are not answered by the district general manager in the Wakefield health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue that arises from the Sainsbury philosophy is that the proposals offer choice. Patient
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
choice underpins the Government's claims for the legislation. I am anxious about it because, as a patient living in the Wakefield health authority area, I could be forced to attend Methley Park hospital, near Leeds, for treatment under the contract arrangements in the Bill. That is a private hospital. At present, I can choose not to have private care. In future I may not have such a choice. I would not want to be seen dead in a private hospital. It is not merely a political issue for me, or for many of my constituents. It is a deeply-held moral conviction that private care is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

After waiting for his operation for 18 months he had reached the stage at which the hospital could do little for him. My father was in the bed next to a patient with the same problem who had been on the National Health waiting list for three months, had queue-jumped and been treated privately.

The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) and his hon. Friends talk about choice, a word frequently used by the Conservative Members. But at the end of the day, in the Government's language, choice amounts to one thing: the possession of monetary advantage. Unfortunately, every week I see people on NHS waiting lists. They are told by their GPs that if they pay £50, £60 or £100 they can queue-jump but many cannot afford to. The free choice that seems apparent to Conservative Members does not exist.

I want to put an argument to the hon. Gentleman that I think would be put to him by a member of the West German Social Democratic party. West Germany spends considerably more on health care than we do but a much higher proportion of that health care is paid for by private contributions throughout society. The position taken by West Germany social democratic society is that if people can afford to contribute some of their higher earnings to health care that will release more resources for people who cannot afford to make that contribution.

Its money comes from public subsidies and from getting doctors and 2,000 nurses a year—trained by the NHS using public resources—to go into the private sector. The huge cost of training a doctor is not paid for by the private sector. It also uses the equipment and facilities of the NHS, which makes it totally dependent upon the National Health Service for its existence.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. Before the hon. Gentleman continues with his speech could I say that, although I listened to the exchanges with interest, they are now going wide of the amendments under consideration? We cannot
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I shall not be drawn into the area that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) mentioned. However, his wife was fortunate because she did not end up in Addenbrooke's hospital, or in Farnborough hospital, Hampshire where they allow funeral directors to place advertisements on the hospital walls. Frankly, I would not like my hospital bed to be beside an advertisement for an undertaker. It does not encourage anyone to look forward to complete recovery when such advertisements are staring him in the face.

I want to make my concern about the core services apparent, especially with regard to maternity care. Constituents of mine who are pregnant now have the choice of a number of hospitals in which to spend their confinement. They may enter the Staincliffe general hospital, Dewsbury, or the General Infirmary, Pontefract, but the majority choose the local Manygates maternity hospital, Wakefield. That amount of choice is commendable. Women, and men who are fortunate enough to be fathers and involved in the birth of their children, are aware that different maternity hospitals have different practices and place different emphasis on certain matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the Manygates maternity hospital in Wakefield—I have a personal interest because I was born there, as were my son and daughter, and we received a first class service—in the context of what is proposed by the legislation. We have no guarantee that a core service will be provided because that hospital is scheduled for closure within the next eight years. The authority wants the maternity service to be based at the district general site at Pinderfields hospital. I do not object to that because there are sound medical reasons for moving the maternity services near the other facilities. I am worried that because of the legislation my constituents may well completely lose a maternity service because the Bill gives no guarantee that that core provision will be made in my constituency. I shall be interested in the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am desperately worried that many other services that we assumed would be provided indefinitely by the NHS in my area may be lost. As surpluses may not be generated in some places and a service becomes a loser service and a drain on the new hospital trust's resources, it may be lost and my constituents will be forced to travel far and wide.

Amendments Nos. 189 and 202 to 210 go to the core of the Bill. They seek to ensure that the NHS becomes a comprehensive service locally and nationally, enabling people to have the widest possible range of services in their areas. A rejection of the amendments by the Minister would be firm evidence that the Government are not committed to the continuation of a comprehensive NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:With respect, the hon. Gentleman slightly misquoted me. I spoke of a comprehensive local health service.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I disagree fundamentally with the hon. Gentleman. My right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a complete misunderstanding of core services. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State was honest enough to admit at yesterday's Select Committee hearing that perhaps the term "core service" should not have been used. Everyone thought of the core curriculum that we debated when the Education Reform Bill, as it then was, was passing through the House, but there is no connection. The hon. Gentleman must try to understand that district health authorities will be required to provide a local health service—the type of comprehensive service that we all want. There will be regulations and directions from Ministers. If they do not provide that service and go off on a frolic of their own, the Secretary of State will step in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:One of the difficulties with major legislative proposals is that often all we do in Committee or on the Floor of the House is introduce a legislative framework and give the Secretary of State of the day power to introduce regulations.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I pointed out that regulations are already required by the National Health Service Act 1977 and that the Bill does not repeal them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. Before the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:You are absolutely right, Dame Janet: you always are. I was directing my thoughts to the amendments relating specifically to core services. The Opposition are hopelessly confused on the subject, and are rather irresponsibly giving the impression to many vulnerable people—as the hon. Member for Wakefield did, but without malice, I am sure—that they will be forced to travel. That is nonsense. We have all heard of cross-boundary flows. People from my constituency travel to London, to Guy's and to other hospitals, because they have the choice to do so. The only difference is that we shall make the system work more efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current ridiculous state of affairs means that the system of payment for cross-boundary flow does not work. The efficiency trap then begins, which means that health authorities which treat ever more people from outside their
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
area lose financially. That will end. We shall increase patient choice and patient care. The Opposition's amendments—whether from incompetence or deliberately I know not, but the Committee will decide—would restrict choice. They would cause problems by causing local authorities to treat people within their own boundaries, which they do not do now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman believes that the Secretary of State has an absolute duty to provide certain services in a locality. On 15 February last I asked the Secretary of State whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"district health authorities and the self-governing hospital will have to provide an operational base for accident and emergency within their locality".</p></blockquote>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"District health authorities will be required to ensure that accident and emergency services, which are core services, are available locally. They may, if they choose, arrange for these services to be provided in their own authority area or in a neighbouring authority area".—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 15 February 1989; Vol. 147, c.	<i> 265–6.</i>]</p></blockquote>
I felt that there was more to it than that. I asked about Calderdale and Bradford. It is clear that Bradford health authority will be able to provide accident and emergency services if the district health authority at Calderdale decides that that is local. That is no guarantee that we shall have an accident and emergency service, and no amount of words will convince the people of Halifax to the contrary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I disagree. It depends upon which way one takes that answer. A Secretary of State cannot lay down precisely which core services a DHA will have. If he does, what is the point of having a local health authority or requiring the DHA to look after its locality's comprehensive health care? We might as well try to do it from Whitehall. We tried that and it was a dismal and appalling failure. There has to be wide discretion with a great deal of common sense. If a DHA does not regard accident and emergency care as a core service and does not think that it ought to provide it, the Secretary of State will step in. I have no doubt that that is how the provision will work. We must give local people the opportunity to stop that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Medical Association argued mistakenly about fragmentaion. The DHAs will have the power to stop localised fragmentation of the Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:In his reply to my question on 15 February the right hon. and learned Gentleman spoke about self-governing hospitals. He stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Self-governing hospitals which provide accident and emergency services will continue to provide them unless the district agrees to their relocation." —	<i>[Official Report,</i> 15 February 1989; Vol. 147, c. 266.]</p></blockquote>
The position is plain. The hospitals can put them in another town or city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It would be nonsense to put those services in a town or city that did not serve the interests of a locality. The decision has to be made by a local health authority. It has been said many times by successive Ministers, and no doubt my hon. Friend the Minister for Health will reiterate the point, that if an eccentricity is clearly against the interests of a local population, the Secretary of State will have power to step in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we heard recently, the cumulative health council will have observer status on DHAs. Its position will be clear. It will be the first to make a fuss if local eccentricities arise. It will write to local authorities as will the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon), who will also go straight to the Secretary of State, cause a great row and demand his

intervention. That is the right way to run a local health service. Let the local people run it and let reserve powers be used only if things go wrong. That is what will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have never really understood that core services relate to self-governing NHS trusts. They have nothing to do with the hospitals that do not choose to opt out of National Health Service or regional health authority bureaucracies. It is irresponsible of the Opposition to suggest that people will not know whether they will have accident and emergency facilities, or maternity, paediatric or geriatric services. That is patently nonsense, and I hope that that line of argument will be discontinued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:You are absolutely right, Dame Janet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of the service will be protected by the contractual system. That will be made clear by my hon. Friend the Minister when he winds up the debate. The district health authorities, acting as purchasers, will be free to award contracts outside their own directly-controlled units, and through the clinical audit process. We have not heard much about the latter, although it is to be a major factor in quality control which the Health Service does not have at the moment. Hon. Members ought to know that many district health authorities are already working on quality specifications for contracts. Also, the Government are providing cash to support a series of quality initiatives, including the total quality management scheme, which is being run by 17 district health authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I shall speak briefly to amendments Nos. 160 and 205. They would ensure that children's services, includng community child health services, are regarded as part of the core service in any district or area health authority and are reasonably accessible to its population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments highlight the Opposition's belief that the child health service should be fully integrated as between hospital and community. It should provide acute care, disease prevention, and care for the chronically ill or disabled child, and so support the care given by the general practitioner. Labour Members, and the British Paediatric Association, believe that hospital care for children should be based on a comprehensive children's department, which should have ample provision for in-patient, out-patient
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
and day-care facilities. Children should also be guaranteed the services of regional paediatric specialists in unusual or complex disorders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure that any contract between district health authorities and hospital trusts would include the maintainence of nationally set standards for the quality of child health care. The British Paediatric Association is worried that without those nationally set standards, general practitioners may be inhibited on grounds of cost from referring children to hospital. The indentification and treatment of disorders which may have implications extending into adult life may also be delayed. If hospital trusts are allowed to treat children in inappropriate adult wards, as happens now in the East Glamorgan general hospital in my constituency, because of a desperate shortage of funds for providing accommodation for children, those children will suffer, and not only in an unspecified psychological fashion. Cost restraints in hospital trusts could inhibit referral to specialist children regional and supra-regional services. The lack of mandatory core provision of paediatric services may well result in a fragmentation of the community child health services and threaten the close, informal links that have developed between the child health services, GPs, other health professionals and the complex inter-agency work with social services and education departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BPA has recommended that core services in every district and area health authority must include a child health service that is fully integrated between hospital and community. In other words, there must be paediatric medical care, community child health services and emergency, general and orthopaedic surgery for children. The association believes that nearly all DHAs should undertake common operative elective procedures on children, and many will undertake ear, nose, throat and eye operations. Also, maternity and neonatal services must be sited where there is a comprehensive children's department. It is surely sensible that special consideration should be given to regional services for children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 160 does not seek in any way to restraint the spirit of enterprise, efficiency and customer orientation that the Government claim to encourage in the Bill. Rather, it seeks to ensure that this vital and sensitive area of health care is on hand for the most vital of our resources—our children. Many right hon. and hon. Members will understand, as parents, the anxiety that can be generated by the lack of such provision for child health care. Lack of it can cause the sometimes needless perpetuation of illness and suffering among children and serious dislocation of life for families that are forced to travel great distances to seek proper health provision for their children. Lack of schools or other amenities can result in awful blight to communities—the slow draining away to better served areas of young families seeking better security for their children—and the lack of core provision of child health care facilities will have much the same effect. That core provision, no less the communications infrastructure and education system, is a central and irreplaceable element of the service infrastructure that underpins the life of communities and regions. That is why I ask the Committee to support amendment No. 160.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I need to speak only briefly, and I shall do so by way of a question to my hon. Friend the Minister. It concerns a fascinating almost philosophical issue that arises in considering a statute: should it be prescriptive in detail or lay down general duties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments tabled by Opposition Members seem, at first sight, to be sensible. They list a series of duties, including general medicine, geriatrics, paediatrics and maternity services, which must be available to the general public. At first sight, therefore, they seem useful amendments that should be accepted. However, my hon. Friend the Minister should answer the question put to him by my hon. Friends the Members for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) and for Harlow (Mr. Hayes): is it right that the Secretary of State is already required under existing legislation to provide a comprehensive range of services, and he delegates that requirement to the DHAs? If that is right, the amendments tabled by Labour Members, I am sure in good faith, may muddy the water, confuse the issue and have an effect that is the opposite of what they seek to achieve: the limitation of the duties of authorities towards the services that they specify. That would be counterproductive to the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have summed up the debate and distilled its essence as best I can, and if my hon. Friend the Minister can reassure us, I am sure that there will be no need for us even to divide on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I wish to comment on the contribution of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). The duty of the Secretary of State is quite clearly set down in section 1 of the National Health Service Act 1977. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the Secretary of State's duty to continue the promotion in England and Wales of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvement—
	<ol>
	<li>in the physical and mental health of the people of those countries, and</li>
	<li>in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
In other words, the Secretary of State has the overall responsibility for the provision of health care in England and Wales. But the Act delegates his responsibilities to RHAs, DHAs and—in Wales—what are now called area health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So how does each district or area define a responsibility that is not set down in tablets of stone in the Act? It makes a decision about its responsibility in accordance with guidelines issued by the Department of Health, in England, and by the Welsh Office in Wales. At present, AHAs and DHAs have a statutory responsibility to provide certain services. That was at the heart of the NHS when it was established. There is a legal responsibility on each DHA to discharge certain functions. The problem with the Bill is that that statutory responsibility is no longer at the heart of its proposals. Instead of statutory responsibility, there is a contractual responsibility. The way in which the contract services are to be discharged is now at the heart of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harlow is not in his place and I apologise for speaking about him in his absence, but engaging fellow that he is, he has not understood the Bill. It is clear that he has not read the 1977 Act; secondly, he has not read the Bill; thirdly, he has not read the White Paper and the working papers that accompany it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It seems that the hon. Gentleman is making a fundamental mistake. If I contract out a
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
service for which I am responsible, I am still responsible for ensuring that the service is delivered, though the deliverer may be a different person. There is no fundamental difference between the 1977 Act and the Bill. The Health Service authority will still be responsible for ensuring that the services are provided although the way in which they are delivered may change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I must correct the hon. Gentleman. There is a fundamental difference. Under the present arrangement, each DHA has a legal obligation to provide a service within its boundaries. The problem arises because under the Bill it can do so in other ways. It can contract out, or agree with a neighbouring authority that those services should be provided 50, 60, 70 or 80 miles away—and still comply with the terms of the Bill. That is the problem which has to be faced, and the hon. Member for Harlow did not address it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have talked about how the new contractual relationship will apply. The real danger of these provisions is that health authorities now under tremendous financial restrain with very tight budgets, will have the right to opt out of providing services which are expensive and difficult to provide in their area. Let us talk about three or four of these: first, mental health strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry to take the hon. Gentleman back a fraction—he has much greater knowledge of the service than I have—but what is the current mechanism under which a district does not provide a service within its own boundary and sends all its patients across the frontier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:We accept that while each area health authority is obliged to provide certain basic services, certain types of treatment need to be undergone in specialised hospitals. For example, patients in my area are sent to Clatterbridge hospital for cancer treatment. That has been a source of concern because of the travelling involved, but not every district hospital can provide the specialist services which Clatterbridge hospital can. Therefore, for specialist services, patients are sometimes sent outside their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harlow said that area health authorities which ran specialist services were properly and adequately compensated for the additional cost, which I accept, and the Bill contains provisions which try to overcome that problem. I find no difficulty accepting them, but I fear that with the new contractual arrangements under the Bill, district health authorities will be able to decide not to provide the Cinderella services, saying "They are too expensive. This year we will overshoot our budget. Next year we will make a contractual arrangement with a neighbouring authority and pool our resources."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I accept that point, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to bear in mind that my constituency is a rural area, where there are vast distances to travel. If someone living in Holyhead needs a service, for example, he already has to travel 23 miles to the nearest district general hospital; and if the services is not there, he is obliged to travel at least 70 miles to the next hospital. The problem is one of logistics, distance and inconvenience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Ynys Môn, especially on the Children Bill, I would be greatly surprised if he had not. I found that the hon. Gentleman worked very hard at understanding the Bill, dealing with the Government's response and the working papers, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the confusion and problems over local provision which he mentioned will be made more difficult because of the Government's steadfast resistance to the arguments that are advanced on behalf of the mentally ill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Absolutely. I was coming to that. I shall give an example of what I mean about DHAs coming to certain decisions. Every year in January, coming up to the end of the financial year, they are in financial crisis because they are running out of money. In the past, they have frozen posts which they describe as non-essential, such as cleaners and porters, for example. This year they are freezing medical posts because of the constraints on them. I have a letter from the chairman of the advisory sub-committee on mental health in Wales which tells me that Gwynedd health authority has frozen the post of a consultant psychiatrist in mental handicap, which will deprive the districts of Arfon, Dwyfor and Ynys Môn of a specialist medical service in mental handicap. The post will not be filled because of the financial constraints at the end of the financial year, thus making a nonsense of Gwynedd's contribution to the all-Wales strategy on mental handicap of which it has been in the forefront, as I am sure the Minister from the Welsh Office will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Committee make of that? As a result of financial constraints, a particular health authority has decided not to make an appointment, and because there is no consultant, the importance which the DHA attaches to the post is degraded. The psychiatrist concerned wrote to me as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Colleagues in Gwynedd have therefore decided on this occasion to speak out against what would seem to be a deliberate 'cut' in the mental handicap service as opposed to services for other disabled people, and have asked me, as Chairman of their College in Wales, to write to you to let you know what is happening and of our concern about cuts in patient care."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. It is in order for the hon. Gentleman to make a passing reference to a particular situation to illustrate a point which relates to the amendments, but I fear that he is now digressing from that. May I remind him of the amendments that are under consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am obliged to you for reminding me, Dame Janet. The point which I am trying to illustrate is that unless core services are defined in the Bill, services which are not seen as core services could be sidelined by a DHA under financial constraint. There is no way in which Gwynedd health authority would ever decide in cold blood that it could do without the service to which I referred, but the financial constraints on it may force it to consider that option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The South Manchester has a similar problem, where 100 posts have been frozen. Half of the posts of psychiatric community nurse are unfilled. As a result, the movement
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
of people out into community care has had to stop and the remaining community-based psychiatric nurses have had to move back into hospital to fill the vacant nursing posts to ensure that there is psychiatric patient service in the authority. Therefore, community care loses out and support for psychiatric care is seriously undermined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for highlighting the point from his own experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, let me remind Committee members of what the Government said in their White Paper. In paragraph 4.15, they say that core services are those
	<br><blockquote><p>"to which patients need guaranteed local access."</p></blockquote>
However, according to working paper 2, it will be for each district to consider what their core services should be in the light of their own circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although five broad categories are outlined in the White Paper suggesting core services that each district health authority should have, they are not included in the Bill. There will be no legal requirement to provide them. Provided that the authority makes a contract with a privately-run hospital or an NHS trust in its own area or with a neighbouring authority, the inconvenience of the patient will not matter. Patients' choice, which Conservative Members champion will not be a requirement, provided the authority can discharge its responsibilities under the broad brush of the Bill.

I have strayed slightly from the amendments but it was necessary to put the record straight on what the Government intend to do. The amendment, which seeks to introduce some certainty into core services, is essential for patients if they are to know what they will get in their area when the Bill becomes law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My first point is in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) and of amendment No. 221 in which he dealt with the assessment of need and the importance of its being enshrined in a public document. My hon. Friend made it clear that authorities have been advised by circular to do that, and my hon. Friend the Minister made it plain that he regards it as extremely important. I hope that when my hon. Friend the Minister replies to the debate he will deal with that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second and third points relate to the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). The Opposition may unwittingly have tabled the amendments to the wrong clauses. As I understand it from reading the Bill, the amendments relate more specifically to clauses 5 to 10, which deal with NHS trusts. They do not relate to clause 3. Therefore, I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister would clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments are set wrongly against the clause, are they not too restrictive in their definition of core services? Would they not leave the Bill in a much worse condition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I want to speak for only two minutes. Most of the arguments have been advanced by my hon. Friends. In the "NHS and Independent Hospitals" report by the National Audit Office there is a clear statement based on interviews with health authorities, especially the North West Thames region, following the waiting list initiative, that patients are reluctant to travel. It was based on interviews undertaken
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
by National Audit Office officials with consultants in those areas, and can be found in paragraph 2.23.1 hope that the Minister takes note of it. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The region considered that the poor response was due to general practitioner and consultant concern over transferring patients to other consultants and patients' reluctance to travel."</p></blockquote>
So it is established by the National Audit Office as a principle.

When my wife was pregnant in 1976, she did not want to have her baby in a hospital outside Workington. She was required to have the baby in Whitehaven because of a complication in the Workington maternity unit. That unit is now closed, which means that all babies from my constituency have to be born in Whitehaven. The Minister is saying that the district health authority covering my constituency could decide that local provision could be provided in an area that might extend as far as Barrow-in-Furness, Kendal or Carlisle. I should like the Minister to deny that if it is not true. On behalf of my constituents, I strongly object to that possibility, which the Bill does not rule out. They will be able to read in their local paper that I have asked the Minister to ensure that that does not happen. My belief is that he is unable to give me such an assurance, because of the nature of the contracts, to which we have been denied access, and of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I shall speak especially to amendment No. 189.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) referred to the notes on the Bill which describe accident and emergency services as core services, but, on something so essential, it is what the Bill says that matters. Amendment No. 189 is phrased with limpid clarity and simply says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each district health authority shall ensure that the following service is provided within the district; accident and emergency services and services taking immediate admissions from A amp; E units (including general surgery)."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton referred also to inconvenience and hardship. But there is no greater inconvenience or hardship than to need emergency treatment only to find that none is immediately available. This is another area in which choice is absolutely meaningless. A clear obligation should be written into the Bill. The general public require that, as do the health authorities and hospital administrators, who need to know that they have an immediate and direct obligation. That is why the amendment is proper, is in the right place and should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accident and emergency service is in the front line. Its effective local provision should not be a matter of flexibility. Conservative Members make great play of the need for flexibility, but people should have no doubts about that service. The delivery of a service is important, but so is confidence in it. We can all imagine incidents that might happen—a train or car crash, a heart attack, or a gas explosion—and on such occasions we need to know that the emergency service will be available quickly, with the high quality of treatment that is required. We should not have to worry about how far we have to be taken for treatment, or how long that will take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have said that the amendment will limit the Bill and limit the scope of district health authorities. They are right; that is what we want to do. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) has spoken about the flood of documents on profit-related
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
services within health authorities. That flood has been directed by Government pressure, even in advance of the Bill. It is creating the wrong pressure on decision-making within hospital services. The Bill should require, in unequivocal language—some administrators still manage to interpret it creatively—that accident and emergency services be local.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my hon. Friends have said that health services need to be local and I shall refer to a parochial example. In the South Glamorgan area, there is a problem over the future of the accident and emergency unit. The hospital providing those services is in the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, and it is just across the border with my constituency. The staff there provide an excellent service in a building with facilities that should belong to medical history rather than modern medical practice. The Bill undermines planning procedures, and that is only one reason why the South Glamorgan health plan is in disarray.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Wales must be worried, because his constituents are affected by the doubt over the future of the service. There should not be even the slightest risk of accident and emergency provision being in the next county or further afield, yet the Bill will allow that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have referred to cross-boundary services. They are not normally a problem in my constituency, although in Llantwit Major, for instance, the ambulance service has to decide whether to go east to Cardiff or west to Bridgend. It is a crucial service, and it played a major part in discussions during the Vale of Glamorgan by-election in 1989, when the Labour party candidate, now my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith), highlighted the inadequacy of emergency provision in the rural parts of the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxiety about the emergency services is the main reason why the ambulance workers' cause has been taken up so passionately by the public, and the issue was telling during the by-election. The Vale of Glamorgan is the smallest county in Wales, and one of the smallest, if not the smallest, in England or Wales, yet the emergency services are a major issue there. They must be a major issue in every county in the country. To suggest that an accident and emergency unit could be in the next county is as ludicrous as suggesting that there should be tendering for ambulance services and choices available to patients at the roadside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) referred earlier to a written answer that she received from the Secretary of State, in which he made it clear that district health authorities
	<br><blockquote><p>"may, if they choose, arrange for these services to be provided in their own authority area or in a neighbouring authority area depending on what is more convenient for patients." —	<i>[Official Report,</i> 15 February 1989; Vol. 147, c. 266.]</p></blockquote>
There will be no assurance, if it is not contained in the Bill, that the convenience of patients will be properly considered when such decisions are taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I tried to pin the Minister down on the question of whether Halifax will keep its existing accident and emergency service. Halifax is in the middle of the Pennines and people in some villages already find it difficult to get to a central point. If there were an amalgamation and Kirklees had to provide the accident and emergency service, lives would be lost. It would not be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
possible to reach the emergency services in anything like the time that they can be reached now—and it is already difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend illustrates the point perfectly. I note that the answer that she received continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Self-governing hospitals which provide accident and emergency services will continue to provide them unless the district agrees to their relocation." —	<i>[Official Report,</i> 15 February 1989; Vol. 147 c. 266.]</p></blockquote>
Within what criteria will the district allow relocation? The fact that the Secretary of State allows for such a possibility is shocking and disturbing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many major issues involving accident and emergency units—and trauma services in general—should be explored. The Royal College of Surgeons has explored them well in a valuable paper produced several months ago. It is essential to plan for the services, and to find a balance between the concentration of expertise and special facilities, and convenience and speed of access and response. Cost comes into the equation, but these are the most important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, however, and the pressure placed by the Government on everyone in the Health Service, put cost first, second and last. It should not have that pre-eminent position. When the immediacy of services is at issue, and when people need help to survive, cost should not occupy that position. The matter is blunt and urgent. The Bill does nothing to help planning of and debate on the provision of accident and emergency services; it introduces confusion and inefficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have spoken today of letting local people run the health services. That is hypocritical nonsense, because the Government have spent 10 years undermining local decision-making in the Health Service, and the Bill takes that further. People want immediate, accessible high-quality local accident and emergency services: they should be written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are not just confused; they show a fundamental failure to understand the health needs of individuals and of communities. Their needs should be the starting point for health care. I urge the Government to accept the amendment. It is ludicrous to suggest that the public do not want an assurance in the Bill that accident and emergency units will be provided as basic requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I welcome the debate. It will clarify the Government's intentions and set on record what my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary has said in correspondence with my hon. Friends and me. In the earlier months of the campaign against the Bill and against the White Paper, much anxiety was created, especially in rural areas such as my constituency, because people were worried that patients would have to travel long distances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what my hon. Friends the Members for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) and for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) was wrong about the accident and emergency services. My constituents and my family will be interested in the outcome of the debate. My family lives equidistantly from three general hospitals, about 25 miles from Taunton, Barnstaple and Exeter. Many patients in rural
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
areas already have to travel some distance to hospitals. They should be reassured that when they need treatment they will not have to travel further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones). Like other hon. Members, he overstated his case. My mother lives in his constituency. During the last decade she has had one minor stroke and a more serious one that required urgent attention in the general hospital just outside Bangor on the mainland, 20-odd miles from her home. I therefore have a personal interest in the Minister's response to the debate. Any assurances will be welcomed by my constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I refer to amendments Nos. 283 and 212, which relate to core services and the contract system. The amendments change the word "power" in clause 3 to "duty" in respect of regional, district or special health authorities. The change of wording represents the difference in attitude and in principle between the Government and the Opposition. To judge by the contributions from Labour and Plaid Cymru Members this morning, Opposition Members believe that a comprehensive core service is a right. Most patients recognise and readily expect such a service to be provided by a district hospital. It is the duty of the state, through the tax system, to ensure that such facilities are available. The Government, especially the Department of Health, believe that a power be available to health authorities, not a duty incumbent upon them. That is the difference between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members say that Opposition Members have been playing on people's fears. But the absence in the legislation of a categorically defined maternity service is bound to provoke fear, mistrust and apprehension among the public. Far from being irresponsible in pointing it out, any hon. Member would be failing in his responsibility to constituents if he did not draw attention to it as a manifest shortcoming of the legislation. That is only an example and the debate has been useful in drawing attention to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be a duty at all times and on every occasion to override the contract system if it is to benefit the individual. The Government have said repeatedly that the Bill is about the rights of the patient who is viewed as a consumer within a restructured market place. The truth is closer to the comment some time ago in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In Mr. Clarke's proposed health care market, almost all the money will be supplied by Central Government. Final consumers (patients) will have no direct purchasing power."</p></blockquote>
There will be no patient choice in the economic sense, as the Government suggest. Patients will be removed further from decision-making in the NHS. They will have a comprehensive choice only by having the option of going private. Our debate should be about improving the NHS, not about private health care. That alternative is inescapable, and the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) testified to it most eloquently. He highlighted the proposal's deficiencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, patients who wish to be treated by a particular specialist or at a certain hospital have to convince their GP that that is right, unless there is a medical reason for their going elsewhere. The patients' views are therefore taken into account. If the Government were serious about a patient market, they would seek to achieve easier cross-boundary flows. But under the new rules, the doctor must justify breaking the contract. He is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
unlikely to wish to do so unless his clinical judgment advises him otherwise. Insuring that the patients' wishes are met will not be a feature of the new system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am reluctant to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but he is arguing about contracts which relate to clause 4. I thought that he would refer to contracts and relate the issue to the amendments. He has not done so. I ask him please to return to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am trying not to deviate too far from the amendments, but this clause cannot be viewed in isolation from the following clause. We are discussing core services and the rights of the patient. It is difficult artificially to divorce that from what will happen to the doctor-patient relationship when the patient demands the right to a certain referral. The doctor will be in a difficult relationship with the authority in deciding whether to override the contract. I shall bear your stricture in mind, Dame Janet, because it has helped me to make my point more clearly, without going down the highways and byways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members pointed out that there is no adequate definition of a core service in the Bill. It would seem better for the Government to follow the recommendation of the Royal College of Midwives and others that core services be written into the Bill as the National Health Service facilities that we now assume to be widely available in every locality. The onus would then be on the authority to opt out of any one service. A set of core services should not just be drawn up at community level. If there is a national criterion, the onus will be on the local authority to justify deviations or withdrawals from it. That would be infinitely preferable to the proposals in the Bill.

12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to develop the point that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) made about Cumbria, which is the part of the country that he represents. The regional and geographical problems are replicated to the power of 10 in the part of the country that I represent: the vast and dispersed highlands and islands of Scotland. There is only one major hospital, in Inverness —Raigmore Hospital—which is an excellent hospital with an excellent range of facilities. I hate to think what would happen if it opted out. If, for the sake of argument, its core services did not include maternity, it would be beyond comprehension how the Health Service there could cope in a practical way. Nothing in the Bill will guarantee that that disastrous state of affairs will not develop. That is a deficiency in the Bill, and the Government should redress it by responding positively to these and other amendments, and to the arguments that we shall have on the next clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I want to speak to amendments Nos. 206 and 158. My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) made a very telling comment when he said that maternity services had not been excluded, but forgotten, and it is significant that the Department of Health should admit to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter from Mrs. Mackintosh, the secretary to the Halifax branch of the Royal College of Midwives, dated 12 January. She wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On behalf of the local branch of the Royal College, together with most midwives in the UK, may I say that we are all extremely disturbed that there is still no reference to the Maternity Service being considered a core service in the governments N.H.S. Bill.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Surely it cannot be acceptable that such an important aspect of health care should be ignored at this important time. Mr. Clarke's interest in the service and the midwifery profession appears to be non-existent."</p></blockquote>
I want the Minister to prove Mrs. Mackintosh and the midwives wrong. I want him to say that the Government, who profess to be deeply committed to choice, will put their money where their mouth is, and allow the choice that now exists to continue and to improve. Under the present NHS system a woman can choose where to have her baby; she can choose either her local hospital or one in a different district if that is more convenient or if it has more suitable care. I should be horrified if my constituents could not choose to come into Halifax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much confusion about the Government's definition of "local". They intend to push that responsibility on to panels mainly composed of male business men. However, my constituents and I believe Halifax to be local for maternity services, especially considering the geography of the town and the fact that many of its hill villages are above the snow line, which means that it is difficult to get to the local maternity hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective of all involved with maternity services in the past decade has been to ensure fewer departmental divisions between those who provide the service, so that a woman has access to a team of professionals who work together on an integrated basis. My hon. Friends the Members for Peckham (Ms. Harman) and for Livingston and also Conservative Members have spoken about an integrated comprehensive service. We want to keep what we have and improve upon it if possible. We are all deeply worried that that will not happen. Patterns of care involving midwives working both in hospitals and in community service have been developed to ensure continuity for women. We want that continued. We also want the shared care between hospital, community service and general practitioners that has developed over the years to continue and to improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been advised by a body of expert opinion. The Women's National Commission proposed in its report,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Women and the Health Service"</p></blockquote>
that those responsible for antenatal care consider whether their classes and clinics are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Accessible, conveniently sited and timed with regard to local transport".</p></blockquote>
That is essential for maternity service ante-natal and post-natal care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Community Health Councils for England and Wales produced a report after careful and detailed study across the country. The report concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The length of time and costs incurred by women in travelling to ante-natal clinics are significant factors in determining whether they continue with ante-natal care".</p></blockquote>
That relates strongly to the amendments. I urge the Minister to accept that, for maternity services, "local" must mean just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal College of Midwives submitted evidence to the Social Services Committee in April 1989. It was emphatic about the inclusion of maternity services. I urge the Minister to include many of its recommendations in the Bill. Its memorandum stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provision of appropriate maternity care for each woman should be provided as close as possible to the woman's home.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The maternity services should provide flexible responsible care so that the individual needs of the woman and her family are met.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>The service should be managed and funded as an integrated whole so that there are no artificial divisions between the various settings where the woman receives care. The individual should experience a co-ordinated service, comparable standards and consistent advice whenever she is receiving care. Experience has demonstrated that where the hospital maternity and community services have been managed separately, these objectives are not achieved."</p></blockquote>
It is therefore vital that the Government make provision in the Bill for this core service for maternity care. I urge the Minister to reconsider this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most immediate effects of the White Paper proposals will be the fragmentation of the service. Opted-out hospitals will become separate competing units and competition will engender separation rather than co-operation. Hospitals will have contracts with various DHAs and GPs from different arears. Therefore the building of a pattern of team work between hospital, community services and GPs will become more difficult in each area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that we are talking about real people who will have real babies. They are not an accounting cost item. I also remind him that this country does not have a good record on infant mortality. Much of that is due to the location—which is vital—and to the provision of services. The deregulation of bus services has made it far more difficult for women in Halifax to get to antenatal clinics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I urge the Minister to consider these excellent amendments and to give women the message that the Government will include the maternity service in the Bill and recognise that it should be a local service and that there should be statutory provision for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley (Manchester, Wittington)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I shall be brief, but I shall return to that speech later. We are concerned to ensure that the nature and range of the core services are spelled out on the face of the Bill, for the very reasons that Conservative Members have argued that it is not necessary. They have said that the Minister already has a duty to provide comprehensive health care, delegated through the district and regional health authorities. But those authorities have a second duty, in that in each financial year, they have to balance the books.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever I have challenged South Manchester health authority to provide that range of services to meet the needs of local people, it has said that its paramount duty in each financial year is to keep within its cash-limited budget. The only year when that requirement was not paramount was 1987, the year of the general election, when the Tory-controlled health authority was allowed not to balance its books until after the general election. It did not work in the case of my constituency in Withington, but that was the only year in which the health auhority was allowed to overspend to try to fudge the issue of underprovision of health care to meet the needs of local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can already see the problems which South Manchester health authority and many other health authorities are experiencing through not having the resources to meet the range of comprehensive health care which is required. That is another reason why we are so concerned to specify what is required on the face of the Bill. For example, yesterday I had the pleasure of having lunch with Princess Diana at my health authority—not alone, I hasten to add. She came to open the new
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
Nightingale centre for breast screening, a vital new service within south Manchester. However, because of the financial pressure on South Manchester health authority, the very ward where women are placed when they are found to have an abnormality as a result of the screening is currently closed because there are no resources to keep it open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In welcoming Princess Diana to the facility, the chair of South Manchester health authority reminded her that she had the pleasure of visiting our health authority last when she and Prince Charles visited patients who were desperately injured in the Manchester air disaster. She visited Wythenshawe hospital, whose accident and emergency depertment close to the airport had taken in the desparately injured people in that disaster. What is the situation now? As the parliamentary Under-Secretary well knows, South Manchester health authority proposes to close down that accident and emergency department and transfer all its facilities to Withington hospital. Many people know that in the rush hour it takes half an hour to get to Withington from Wythenshawe where the airport is located. If that disaster happened in the rush hour after the accident and emergency department in Wythenshawe closed it would be compounded, because of the reduced services. The whole argument about the Secretary of State's duty to provide comprehensive health care is already being undermined seriously by lack of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 159 widens the debate from specific core services to the need for health authorities to look at comprehensive health care requirements, particularly for elderly people. There is no group of people who are in need of greater access to health care in their own locality—close to where they live. That is essential, first of all because of the growing number of elderly people in greater Manchester, who now comprise 20 per cent. of the population, I believe. Secondly, they are less likely to have access to private transport and will have to rely much more on public transport. Thirdly, they are the group that moves in and out of hospital services and a comprehensive range of GP, domiciliary and hospital based services must be ensured for each community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
we know that if that comprehensive range of services for elderly people is lost, they will be expected to cross boundaries to other districts, travel many miles to receive health care and they will lose rightful access to such services. They will be locked away in their homes and they will not receive essential health or domiciliary care because services have been seriously undermined by cash shortages. Every district health authority must provide a comprehensive health care plan for the elderly to ensure that they know what services are available. I support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) that seeks to ensure that district health authorities meet the needs of elderly people, and others, by matching needs to resources and that each community has access to local health care.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Amendment No. 256 bears a certain similarity to amendment No. 221 tabled by the hon. Member for Ealing, Act (Sir G. Young). The amendment seeks to use what the Government have already conceded in their public health circular 88/64 and the requirement in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
that circular to produce an annual statement of public health care needs in particular areas as the building block of a new approach to health care needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look back at the 1980s, the significant factor was a break through in the Health Service—not this vague, generalised and rather glib Bill—that came with the publication in 1988 of the Acheson report entitled "Public Health in England". That will be seen as the real turning point in health care provision. For the first time in recent decades, that report reminded the Health Service bureaucracy what health is all about and how it is generated. The model of consumption that we are being given as the model of Health Service provision is entirely incorrect. The model we should be adopting is as suggested in amendment No. 221, and in my amendment. We should build a new conception of public health need and use that as a basis for providing public health services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Acheson report reminded us of a simple point. We become ill largely because of the jobs we do—our occupational environment—stress, and the homes and communities in which we live. There are powerful connections between the circumstances of the community and the health needs of the individual. What we do about major health problems that generate the needs and create the expense within the NHS, such as heart and stroke illness, cancer, accidents that affect so many young people, and mental illness—the Cinderella service within the NHS —is fundamentally important. We should deal not only with those conditions when they present themselves, but with their causes, and make them the basic building blocks of the health care system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must shake the domination of elective acute surgery. It dominates discussion in the NHS, but it is not where the money goes. The model of contract that the Government offer leads back to the domination of elective acute surgery, and we must prevent that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, one sixth of hospital medical specialists deal with mental illness and geriatrics, yet those specialities account for more than half of the hospital beds and about half of the expenditure. We need a concept of health needs that changes the priorities—changes from the ground floor. My amendment, like those standing in the name of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton, seeks to create the basic building block—a public health statement, an annual audit of public health needs. My amendment goes further, because it seeks to include within that statement a statement of health advice and education needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I specify the need for family planning advice, because we all know that family planning services are being run down as a result of present cuts in expenditure. My amendment also specifies that the statement should include advice on the planned termination of pregnancy. If such advice were available, there would be fewer late planned terminations and more early planned terminations. It is my belief that there would be fewer planned terminations of pregnancy overall.

My amendment asks for discussion about the annual report between the DHA and the community that it serves. It asks that whatever plans the health authority has in mind to meet the needs that it has identified should be laid on the table and be open for public discussion. The implied model is not the model of the consumer; it is the model of the citizen. We want more choice when it comes to our personal health, and that cannot be disconnected from collective choices about the kind of world in which we live and the kind of communities in which we live, because they
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
generate specific illnesses. There is a link between how we live, how we get ill and how we die. The model of contract that the Bill offers does not recognise that link; it seeks to fragment it. My amendment seeks to put it together again and provide a statement of the consequential research and training needs that will accompany that new conception of the Health Service. We want a Health Service, not an illness service—not one that takes the patterns of illness as given to us at the door of the hospital, but one that seeks to identify their causes and to link the causes with the consequences. That is not a matter of purchasers and providers; it is not a matter of contracts. But it might start to give us the kind of Health Service that we should expect in the year 2000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Mr. Roger Freeman):Although I have always sought to accommodate the Committee's clear wish to move to a decision on a group of amendments, it is clearly unrealistic for me to try to answer in less than four minutes all the questions that have been raised. With the agreement of the Committee, therefore, I shall endeavour to answer my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) and the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe), and then return later in the day to the main points raised by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and many of his hon. Friends. I am grateful for the clarification given by my hon. Friends the Members for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) and for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell), and I hope to return to the key issues this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton spoke to amendments Nos. 221 and 222. We have considerable sympathy with his case for the second amendment, and I know that other members of the Committee have supported him. My hon. Friend is surely right to say that a DHA has responsibility for planning carefully how to provide health care for the residents of its catchment area. Not only should it consult on the basis of its assessment, it should also seek to publish in the form of a health report the consequences of its actions. We shall consider how best to express the implicit duty to assess in regulations that will be laid before Parliament after the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Harlow, prompted by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett), was right to point out that regulations were laid under the National Health Service Act 1977 regarding the duties of DHAs. We shall in due course lay regulations that spell out those duties more clearly; they will be subject to the negative resolution procedure. I assure my hon. Friend that we shall reflect carefully on how best to encapsulate his contribution in regulations.

As to publication of an annual health report, my hon. Friend acknowledged that such a report is already required by statute and published by the director of public health—the new title, following the Acheson report, of the old district medical officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not follow my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton into being over-prescriptive about what the annual public health report should contain, as there is already a statutory requirement. The record will show my hon. Friend's contributions on what he thinks should be in the report. No doubt we shall return to the subject on later clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton was most helpful as regards the data that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
DHAs will require when planning the health care needs of their catchment population. I hope that the Committee will agree with me on what I trust is genuinely a bipartisan matter. We believe that non-clinical registration data collected by FPCs—the future family health service authorities—should be available to DHAs for the planning of health care for their catchment populations. Some FPCs already pass on the data to DHAs. I wish to make it plain on behalf of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and my other colleagues that we consider that a sensible move. We hope that it has the wholehearted support of the Committee.

The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) was wide of the mark in seeking to engender unnecessary fears about patients having to travel great distances for treatment. The whole purpose of the contracting of elective surgery is to widen choice and enable patients seeking a varicose vein operation, hip or knee replacement or a corneal graft to have surgery more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
The hon. Member for Wakefield approached the subject in a highly negative and scaremongering way. Four parties must agree before one of these operations can take place. First, the patient's agreement is necessary. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) cited the National Audit Office. I shall return to his other points this afternoon. There is evidence from a MORI poll that 88 per cent. of patients are willing to travel for quicker treatment and 92 per cent. for better treatment. Therefore, elective surgery outside the district requires agreement by the patient, referral by the doctor, funding by the district health authority and agreement by the receiving hospital to perform the operation. Our proposals would extend choice and enable certain operations to be performed more quickly.
