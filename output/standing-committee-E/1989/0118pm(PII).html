	<p>	<i>[continuation from col. 260]</i></p>
	<p>8.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, shall say a few words on family planning and about negotiating and buying contracts. That could have a disastrous effect on the family planning service. At present, the DHA provides family planning services that give women a choice. I am worried that the choice available to women whether to go to a clinic or to their GPs for contraceptive advice could be restricted under the contract arrangements, although the Government stated that women should have that choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local family planning clinics are important to women, especially those who already have small children, because they are convenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local family planning clinics are held in expensive properties in sought-after locations. It is possible that managers with an eye to profit before service could consider the buildings as a means of making extra money and refer women to their GPs. Women will thus no longer have the option of going to a clinic, and some are reluctant to go to their GPs. Many women, especially the young, are worried that GPs may not provide the same confidential and comprehensive service as the clinics. Women who attend the clinics are offered eight different methods of contraception and specialist counselling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An NHS in which the patients follow the money could have a detrimental effect on a good service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) would vitiate the proposed contracting system. In reply to the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon), we hope that DHAs will consult local GPs about their existing referral patterns and their wishes in respect of future referrals, including those to family planning clinics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect that in the first year, 1991–92, the contracts will broadly reflect the existing referral pattern. Many DHAs and GPs do not know their existing referral patterns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Peckham mentioned noncontractual, emergency referrals. Under clause 4, there is an automatic procedure for emergency referrals outside the contracting system. The receiving hospital will send the bill for treatment to the appropriate DHA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Peckham asked me about nonemergency, non-contractual referrals. The document, "Contracts for Health Services: Operational Principles", to which several hon. Members referred, sets out the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
procedure for such referrals. We want a sensible, quick consultation between the GP and the DHA—not the district general manager — on those ad hoc, one-off, nonemergency referrals. We want common sense to be used in granting permission for such referrals. It is not possible to specify how large the contingency fund should be in each DHA because that depends upon how well it can fulfil the GPs' contractual requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Peckham argued that some hospitals are not accepting patients because they are under funded. I agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) and for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) that some hospitals are not accepting referrals because their budgets for particular specialties have run out; for example, the consultants may have worked so effectively and efficiently that they cannot undertake any more hip replacements for the rest of the financial year. That is the efficiency trap to which my hon. Friends referred. Our proposals for contracting and allowing money to flow from one district to another will help to resolve that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose a fairer system of allocating funds to DHAs based on weighted capitation. Contracts will be placed in advance of that allocation, and it will take some years to achieve. When the districts have a fair, automatic allocation of money, it will be up to them to place contracts and to decide on the location of services for patients. Money will flow across district boundaries to the receiving hospitals. That will enable part of the problem of the efficiency trap to be solved. I hope that the hon. Member for Peckham will not press her amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend what happens if a patient who has been referred to another health district for an operation subsequently needs remedial treatment. He will have to return to the health district where the operation was carried out or have treatment locally. Who will be responsible for paying for the remedial treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rehabilitation would usually be provided in the home district authority. If the patient required further treatment or surgery, the same procedure would apply. The patient's own district would pay the hospital for further treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used the term "remedial treatment". Let me give an example: a hospital authority might contract an operation to another DHA. That operation goes wrong, or is not successful and it is the fault of the DHA in which the operation was performed. It is surely fair that the district that contracted to perform the operation should pay for remedial work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. He is right to mention the prospect of disagreement between health authorities, and, if we reach the relevant amendments this evening, I assure him that I shall deal with the question of arbitration. If there is negligence, as my hon. Friend will know, there are established procedures for patients to pursue claims for negligence. With those remarks, I hope that the hon. Member for Peckham will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only in the last couple of minutes of his response did the Minister come into touch with reality. It is ironic—indeed,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>263</span>
scandalous—when the Government have been in office for 10 years, to hear a Minister talk about hospitals running out of budget because of efficiency. It is nonsensical. Hospitals around the country have problems because of the Government's mismanagement of the NHS and because they have not provided resources where they are needed. The Government have created the NHS's problems and have introduced many distortions and anomalies into the system. People are angry at the Government spending millions of pounds on bureaucracy, instead of meeting or even assessing need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can answer the question which I put to the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) and which she did not answer. It was about contracts. The hon. Lady said that some system would have to be found to recompense DH As that received surplus patients. Surely that procedure is itself analogous to a contract whereby the Government underwrite the Bill, and would it not automatically generate the bureaucracy that the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) has just castigated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a simple answer: no. To recompense another authority for expenditure on a patient who has come from outside the area is a matter that can be dealt with simply and in isolation from the general planning of health care. I do not see the problem, and in my view, my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) answered the question fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister responded in tones of sweet reason, as always, but it is the reasonableness of a money man who understands the price of everything and the value of nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Original! Brilliant!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hardly original, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is so much noise that I cannot hear the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that I do not claim to be original, but I claim to apply that quotation in an extremely appropriate manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In seeking to amend the Bill, we hope to create real choice, as distinct from the spurious imitation of choice that is offered by the Bill and the White Paper. We are offering improvements to an unsatisfactory proposal in an unsatisfactory Bill. We would not choose the starting point of the Bill, but we are endeavouring to improve the Bill. The debate has exposed the fact that the Government are not interested in freedom of choice; they are not interested in quality of service, not in learning from the experience of patients and GPs, which we were told about by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham; they are interested only in pushing through a dogmatic measure. I regret that the Minister is unwilling to accept the improvements that we have offered, and that is why we must press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not have lost the morning's sitting if Ministers had replied to my question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak, first, to amendment No. 150. It seeks to ensure that the great advances made in the appropriate care of children in hospital are not thrown away in the new competitive environment created by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much progress has been made recently on the most effective and appropriate treatment of children who are hospitalised — not least, on how best to protect their psychological wellbeing. The trauma of a child's separation from its parents at a time of illness and anxiety is real, can cause considerable psychological damage, and can impair recovery. Consequently, it is now accepted practice to allow parents to stay with their children in hospital because it ensures the minimum disruption to their wellbeing and decreases their feeling of vulnerability. We believe that those welcome advances in treatment methods should be guaranteed, despite the switch to the profit motive, to say nothing of the competitive ethos which lies at the heart of the Bill and which is such anathema to Labour Members and the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with only one example of the anxiety about quality of care that has been generated by the Government's blind belief that market health care provision works. There are many, many other worries, which is not surprising when the Bill contains no strategy to maintain and improve quality. The Department of Health does not even know how to measure quality, so how can it claim to be protecting it? I shall say considerably more later about the Department's ability to measure quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will create a myriad of incentives to lower quality by introducing considerations of profitability into a market where the consumer can never be sovereign because he or she does not have enough information. The competitive pressure to survive by making a profit will induce providers to lower the quality of care. That in turn is wasteful of resources and leads to poorer health outcomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contracting process will have an adverse effect on quality. In the absence of very close monitoring and regulation, it will encourage the creation of packages of care which will be bought and sold on the internal market. It fails to provide continuity of treatment for episodes of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) evidently is so uncertain of his ground that he has to read every word of the text that has been provided for him. Would it not be more convenient for the Committee if he handed that brief to the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff? The Committee could then proceed with the normal discussion of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. Each hon. Member must decide how to present his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours </div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be pleased to respond to that intervention, Dame Janet. I have two methods of taking part in a debate. If I have time, I speak freely and without notes. If time is limited, I speak from a brief. The problem is that the speed with which the Bill is being driven through the Committee means that hon. Members increasingly have to resort to briefs. I should also point out to the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) that my brief is in longhand. I wrote it myself.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
The Bill fails to provide continuity for episodes of illness in their entirety. An opted-out hospital may thus perform an operation but leave all the follow-up care to other agencies. That will be especially true if a patient has to travel for treatment. The lack of co-ordination is very often detrimental to the patient's health. Amendment No. 151 would ensure that advances in child health care were maintained. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I cannot understand how the Government can oppose it—	<i>[Interruption]</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I deplore some of the seated observations on principle. Some of them are especially stupid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is kind of you, Dame Janet, to intervene to protect me. However, you need not bother. I shall simply plough on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 152 and 153 are slightly different. Essentially, they deal with very important staffing issues. They seek to maintain and improve upon the current employment standards in the National Health Service, thereby guaranteeing the quality of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are both moral and practical reasons why the amendments should be accepted. The National Health Service is the largest employer in western Europe, with slightly more than 1 million employees. It is a very labour intensive public service, and spends three quarters of its budget on its pay bill. It has often been said, but it bears repetition, that the National Health Service's most precious asset is the people who work in it. The amendments seek to protect that asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience of competitive tendering for cleaning, catering and domestic services offers some salutary lessons about the effects of the contracting process. The Government are fond of claiming that such privatisation saves millions of pounds, but the reality is a grim tale of cuts in wages and hours, and of loss of holiday entitlement and sick pay. Savings have been made at the expense of dedicated and committed National Health Service employees. The previous employment of one of the Ministers involved in the Bill consisted of driving health authorities into entering into such contracts wherever possible. The hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) knew that his work involved the exploitation of labour and the lowering of employment conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot continue to sanction such treatment of National Health Service staff, wherever they work. Not only is it wrong, but the looming demographic crisis means that it is also foolish and irresponsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Health Service is entering a period when it will have to compete with other employers for the diminishing pool of young workers if it is to guarantee appropriate staffing levels. That means developing fair employment practices, guaranteeing equal rights for women and ethnic minorities, and so on. Women are crucial to the future of the NHS and they currently make up 80 per cent. of the entire work force. In some areas the NHS relies on ethnic minority communities for staffing and all too often such workers are found in the lowest grades with little hope of career progression. Without the equal opportunity strategies outlined in amendments Nos. 151 and 153, the widening alternative employment prospects for women and ethnic minorities in other areas of the economy are likely to lead to a more severe staffing crisis than at present.

Amendments Nos. 150, 151 and 153 should not go unchallenged. The Opposition Front Bench spokesmen who tabled the amendments have encapsulated all their prejudices, bigotries and so on into those three amendments. My only concern is that, when the Bill receives the Royal Assent and becomes the law of the land and the systems are set up under which patient care will be provided—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only concern is that the service should improve and not deteriorate. There is scarcely a hospital in the land that would be able to comply with the terms of the amendments. If the Committee were unwise enough to accept the amendments, every hospital would be barred from taking on any contracts with the new providing authorities. There is no doubt that the Committee in its wisdom will throw the amendments out as rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) referred to demographic changes. The number of people aged between 16 and 24 years is expected to fall by almost two million during the next 10 years. The NHS must respond to those demographic changes by introducing work patterns that suit women if it is to avoid what the Government have suggested will be a staffing crisis of unprecedented proportions. Those were the terms of a press release by the former Minister for Health, and I presume that it was not motivated by bigotry, prejudice and ignorance, although it might have been motivated by an understanding of the problems. If the NHS were to rely on female school leavers, it would have to recruit half of all the girls leaving school in the 1990s. If the Health Service does not adapt to the consequences of demographic changes, there will be crises and panic similar to that in the education service where there are not enough teachers in schools, and where many teachers, although fully qualified, are not working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the NHS is a major employer of women, it is not an attractive one. In 1987, three quarters of the number of women working in the NHS earned less than £8,300 compared with fewer than half the number of men. Women are much less likely to be employed in higher grades. Last year, the national steering group on equal opportunities in the NHS, which was set up by the Government—again, not I assume motivated by bigotry, ignorance and prejudice — issued its report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only twice in our proceedings has an hon. Member declined to give way to an intervention and, both times it was the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) in response to me. Will my hon. Friend consider whether it really is a matter of bigotry and prejudice to arrange for parents to stay overnight in the hospital in which their child is a patient? Did not the Prime Minister say that last night? Did she not say that fathers should not desert their children? When the Children Bill was enacted, it rightly declared that the interest of the child was paramount. What was bigoted and prejudiced about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national steering group on equal opportunities in the NHS concluded that the NHS assumed that its employees' working lives would comprise unbroken, full-time work. If the employees did not conform to that, they were penalised in respect of their promotion prospects and pay. In short, the NHS assumed that its women employees would have a male employment pattern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady might be interested to know that my wife works in the National Health Service. She was the first person in her teaching hospital to apply for a job share. She had to do all the work herself to persuade the hospital to employ her on that basis. There are now a large number of job sharers, not only in that hospital, but throughout that district health authority area. That way forward is entirely appropriate; it does not require further protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some progress has been made, but it is patchy and too slow. We must accelerate that progress or we shall face a staffing crisis, and employees will not be in the Health Service when we need them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A survey was carried out in north Staffordshire on the difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff. It concluded that three major factors were barriers to women returning to work in the NHS after maternity leave: lack of domestic child care support, lack of opportunity for job sharers at all levels and lack of returner schemes to enable women to bridge the gap when returning to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that the Minister for Health is never in Committee when we discuss women's issues such as family planning, maternity services or women employees in the NHS. Although she was aware that the amendment would be discussed, we could count on her not being here. Even if the Under-Secretary of State for Health does not accept the amendment, will he undertake to initiate a programme to ensure that it suits women to work in the National Health Service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reforms should include recruitment inducements, career-break schemes, training and flexible working arrangements. Goals must be set. The NHS management board and other top managers must ensure that health authorities meet specific targets so that we can measure progress and not have to rely on anecdotal information about the wives of Members of Parliament—welcome, though it is. The Government must recognise that the norm of NHS employment patterns has to change to reflect that it is mainly an employer of women, not men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NHS must recognise that it employs women who are workers and mothers, and workers and carers of elderly parents. The NHS forces women either to be torn in half trying to balance both roles or to choose between them.

Women are the present work force of the NHS, and older women will be its future work force. Unless the Government plan sensibly and take concerted action, those women will not be there when we need them. Our amendments seek to ensure that they are.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek your guidance, Dame Janet, and perhaps that of my hon. Friend the Minister. Speeches have been made on three of the four amendments. Amendment No. 227 seems to touch on a different aspect. I do not criticise your selection or grouping of amendments, Dame Janet. I shall defer further comment if my hon. Friend the Minister intends to speak about whether there should be a statement of the standards of goods and services within a NHS contract. But we may be able to explore the subject more fully when we discuss later amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government believe that the introduction of contracting and the other reforms in the White Paper will encourage good practice and improve the quality of service in the NHS. The introduction of choice tends to improve the quality of services. When rational, intelligent human beings sitting on district health authorities seek to improve the quality of services available in their catchment areas, they usually succeed in doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) — choice and a contracting system will improve quality. I agree with many of the comments made by the hon. Members for Peckham (Ms. Harman) and for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), especially about overnight accommodation. My wife has just enjoyed that excellent facility at St. Thomas' with our youngest child. It is becoming more widely available in the NHS. It is equitable and required in the Health Service of the future, because we face a demographic trough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to convey a reasoned response to the hon. Lady's arguments. To encourage the employment of women, especially among qualified staff, we need returner schemes, flexible working hours and creche facilities. Whenever my colleagues and I visit hospitals we ask administrators whether they adopt such practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NHS has an excellent record of employing people from ethnic minorities. We want a higher proportion of them to seek employment in the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that when he goes to hospitals he asks administrators whether they have creche facilities. It would be useful for the Minister to say that, henceforth, the Government will collect information centrally about the provision being made and the creche facilities that are available. It is daft for the Government to say that those facilities are needed and, when Parliamentary questions are asked about the number of creches that are available, to reply that the information is not held centrally. Will he arrange for the collection of that information so that we may measure progress without having to rely on anecdotes about his wife and those of other hon. Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly reasonable request. The collection of information poses an extra burden but, certainly, I shall consider it. I am sure that the hon. Lady will ask further questions about the matter, so I shall look into the central collection of the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a great mistake for my hon. Friend to miss an opportunity to say that the role of volunteers in the National Health Service is not only important but expanding rapidly. It plays a major part in preventing older people from getting ill by providing them with a range of interesting and valuable functions to perform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with the intervention made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims). We intend to set up a framework for contracting and that is why we seek to establish a contracting mechanism through primary legislation but not in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect district health authorities to make decisions about what they wish to place in contracts, and what may be included will be based on guidance that we shall issue. As I said to the hon. Member for Workington, within the next few weeks, the Department will issue guidance on specimen or model contracts to provide clear instructions about the way in which district health authorities can achieve improvements in the quality and standards of health care from the various providers. Obviously, the contracts will be based on the law of the land relating to equal opportunities and our definite desire to improve the quality of the health care that is provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand what sort of competitive pressure on a directly-managed hospital would make it want to provide overnight facilities for the parents of a child receiving treatment. I understand instinctively how competition works but not how competitive pressure could require my district hospital, for example, to introduce such facilities. Surely, the pressure is to reduce costs at every stage and not to include something that could be taken away. There is no competition and there will be none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's philosophical approach is different from mine. He sees the National Health Service through the eyes of a believer, in a command economy and structure for it. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is still too much noise and far too many seated interventions. I know that it has been a long day, but I like certain courtesies to be observed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not believe that we should specify and stipulate in great detail the nature and quality of services provided by means of primary legislation. That is impossible, so it is not the right way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our approach is to set in place a framework for contracting. It is marginal only in certain cases because most services must be provided locally at a district general hospital, but some choice is possible, as I said, for elective surgery. A key element that a district health authority would take into account when placing contracts, not in paediatrics but in elective surgery, is the quality of the service provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the model contracts will be available within the next few weeks. Will they be available for scrutiny by the Committee, because that would be extremely useful?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered that question.

If I heard my hon. Friend correctly, he said that the contracts will be based on the law of the land. Those may not have been his exact words, but I believe that the contracts will not be legally enforceable. So it is important to know what will be in them and how they will be enforced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that my hon. Friend did not hear what I hope that I said about contracts being based in part on the general law of the land governing, for example, equal opportunities. We do not propose that the contracts will be legally enforceable in the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that we have not dealt with overnight accommodation in enough detail. I remember being lobbied two or three years ago by an admirable organisation called NAWCH, which looks after the interests of children in hospital. As a result of extensive correspondence and pressure, Ministers at my hon. Friend's Department gave considerable guidance on the provision of overnight accommodation for children in hospital. I understand that that guidance still exists. Is there any reason why that guidance will not continue to be valid under this legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said already that we regard that practice as good. We want a higher proportion of hospitals involved in paediatric care to provide overnight accommodation, and a consistent advance in that provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Minister is dreaming; he does not live in the real world. I shall tell him what will happen in the self-governing hospitals. There will be pressure from within the hospitals to get the best consultants. The price of employing consultants will increase, and they will demand more and more expensive equipment. Wherever possible, they will work in high-technology areas of medical care. More of the budgets will be directed towards those areas and, although we welcome that, we know that they will be developed only at the cost of making minor but important concessions in general health care. The Minister may deny it, but that is how the market works. If he does not believe me, he should ask consultants what they intend to do. When the wages council agreements have been broken and the pay review board for doctors has been abolished, consultants will command an increasingly high proportion of medical budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reject the hon. Gentleman's argument: it is he who does not live in the real world.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 213, in page 4, line 25, at end insert—

I shall not detain the Committee. We shall return to the many aspects of the contract system set out in clause 4.1 want to talk about doctors and their rights of referral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Family practitioner committees write to doctors for information about what are charmingly described as their "referral habits". They promise that, under the new regime that will follow the implementation of the Bill, they will do their best to ensure that rights of referral for individual patients are accommodated and upheld. The doctors are worried, as the Minister knows, that Government plans will mean that their clinical judgment could be undermined or overturned. Where there is a good, local district hospital, which is providing a good range of services, most local general practitioners usually want to refer their patients to it. The contract system meets that objective—there is no serious doubt about that. The legitimate anxiety arises in complicated cases in which the doctor's clinical judgment is to send the patient not to the customary point of reference — the local hospital—but elsewhere. The local treatment for a speciality may not be up to standard. The doctor and patient, based on their long-standing professional relationship, may know that a particular hospital setup outwith the immediate area is the best one

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>273</span>
to use. In those cases, medical anxiety over the Bill is well-placed. My amendment, though it could no doubt have been more felicitously drafted, seeks to highlight that. Doctors may find their clinical judgment and their ability to do their best for their patients called into doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will no doubt become as worried as I became when I looked further into the yellow document which the Minister said was the authoritative source for the Government's views. Paragraph 3.16 of "Contracts for Health Services: Operational Principles" states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A presumption of the right to make an extra-contractual referral cannot therefore be a guarantee that the DHA would in all cases agree to meet the cost."</p></blockquote>
That envisages extra-contractual referrals for which the cost will not be met. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"DHAs will however need to develop sensitive procedures for handling such cases."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I am sure that that is not the complete assurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The phrase "develop sensitive procedures", smacks of Sir Humphrey in "Yes, Prime Minister". It covers the predictable multitude of sins that will arise when general practitioners and patients find themselves in the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am beginning to think that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) has Liberal inclinations because he has quoted so often from the yellow book—I recall that in days gone by, Liberals talked of such a book. They laid great store by it, but I am sure that it is not the same because it had much more good sense in it than that which the Minister has brought forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made reassuring noises about referral, but are clear that the general practitioners' right of referral cannot be interpreted as a licence for practitioners to disregard the contractual arrangement. A presumption of the right to make an extra-contractual referral cannot be a guarantee that the DHA will meet the cost in all cases. Given the basis that the Government have outlined for contracts, it is nonsensical that they should have proceeded without building in guarantees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with the words of the president of the Royal College of Nursing, Christine Hancock, who has experience both as a nurse and as an administrator. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The stark fact is that under the Government's health market the doctor's judgment on where his or her patient should be treated may be discounted. The patient's wishes will simply be irrelevant."</p></blockquote>
If that is even the threat of the legislation, I do not see how the Committee — far less the full House—can pass it in unamended form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in something of a quandry because the hon. Gentleman seemed to be speaking about a different amendment, although you called amendment No. 213, Dame Janet. With your permission, I shall answer the thrust of his remarks although amendment No. 213 concerns an entirely different subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) referred to the yellow pages. I know that he is not implying that the document from which he was quoting was secret. It is "Contracts for Health Services: Operational Principles", which is published by Her
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>274</span>
Majesty's Stationery Office, and I have put a copy in the Library. We are not in any way seeking to hide an important document from Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) said, paragraphs 3.14, 3.15 and 3.16 of the document refer to non-emergency, non-contractual referrals. I frankly admit that we have been forced to consider how we can provide guidance on a simple, quick and non-bureaucratic method to cover the referral of patients not covered by contracts. That might involve one or two patients and doctors and two hospitals for nonemergency treatment—typically, elective surgery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we have made substantial progress for the medical profession with our proposals, and I commend the document to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The significance of the document from which we have all been quoting is precisely that it is not secret: it has been sent to every general manager in the country. It is a public document, and is part of the subject of this debate. When general practitioners make extra-contractural referrals, the district health authority may not pay. If the district health authority does not pay, who does? That is a simple enough question. It is there in black and white in the Minister's own document which every general manager in the country has that the district health authority may not pay in all cases. Who pays when the district health authority does not pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State for Health said yesterday to the Select Committee that we are pleased at the response from the number of GP practices which want to become fund holders. Ultimately, we would like more decisions to be made by primary health care providers and general practices because then there would be no question about who paid. Those who hold the funds in the practice will make those decisions. I have already said that in a contracting system in which district health authorities make the decisions about contracts, there are bound to be potential referrals — non-emergency referrals — outside contracts. There will have to be prior clearance between the doctor and the district health authority. That is inescapable, but we want the process to be simple, quick and non-bureaucratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye did not get on to the arguments for amendment No. 213, I must say that it would effectively make contracts legally enforceable in the courts. That is not our intention; we believe that would be cumbersome and inappropriate. A system of arbitration is better, and that is provided by clause 4. We have not yet worked out the details of or decided on the precise method of arbritation, but it will be for the Secretary of State to arbitrate in those cases where there is dispute on contracts already in place, and where conciliation by the regional health authorities has not worked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 246, in page 4, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) Any health service body which is party to an NHS contract as a provider shall not refuse any reasonable request on behalf of the acquirer for access to premises or data, provided such access is for the sole purpose of ensuring compliance with specifications within the contract, and that such disclosure does not enable identification of individual patient records.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would make the Secretary of State ensure that NHS units have adequate information of management systems before they enter the so-called market in health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are in such a rush to legislate that they have not catered adequately for the possibility of, for example, the provider overcharging when the loser will be the taxpayer, or undercharging when the loser will be the patient — as the unit strives to restrict costs to stay within its budget. My hon. Friends will agree that such a scenario is all too familiar within the Government's management of the Health Service today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In support of the amendment I quote three authorities. First, the Select Committee on Social Services said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that the Government do not attempt a full separation of purchasing from providing health care until the necessary infrastructure in terms of systems, equipment and staff is in place."</p></blockquote>
In August 1989, the National Audit Office reported a lack of systems within the NHS able to cope with the market envisaged in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the independent King's Fund Centre pointed out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is … important to stress that unless prices actually reflect costs, there is absolutely no reason to suppose that efficiency will result. Decisions based on imperfect price signals will result in the misallocation of resources."</p></blockquote>
As my hon. Friend said, the Government are failing to understand the way that the market that they have created will work. That is reinforced by those quotations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Information systems do not yet exist in a dependable form. Instead of moving forward carefully and securing each step before going on to the next, instead of learning the lessons of adequate pilot projects, instead of learning from the fact that the 1989 information report did not work and had to be speedily withdrawn, the Government are again pursuing dogma at a cost to patients and taxpayers alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment as a piece of sweet reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 246 stands in the name of the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones). It would give the inquirer access to information and must be in the public interest when we are considering the bureaucratic nightmare in which the public interest would be lost if the Government had their way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to amendment No. 246, already referred to by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). I am grateful for his support of the principle of my amendment. It is designed to uphold the quality of care — a principle to which the Government presumably subscribe. It would allow district health authorities as health care purchasers to have access to the premises and data of health care providers, to ensure that contract specifications are being met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>276</span>
The Government have already agreed that there should be some access provision for purchasers. I refer to the document that has so occupied the Committee— "Contracts for Health Services: Operational Principles", which was published by the Department in 1989.I shall not read paragraph 4.17 as I am sure that the Minister is fully aware of its contents, but it sets out the Government's arguments for providing protection. We are conscious that, although that provision for access to information was suggested in the paragraph to which I referred, it has not been included in the Bill. Why have the Government included it in the yellow document, or whatever we wish to call it? When the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr Bennett) refers to it as the "Lloyd George document", I wonder what Lloyd George would think about some of our remarks today. I do not understand why the Government have given credence to the principle in that document but are not willing to see it enshrined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a provision would protect those district health authorities in rural areas that face a monoploy supply of health services. There may only be one main hospital. If access rights were negotiable under contracts, monopoly providers would be able to whittle away demands for access. Disclosure of patient data is vital for the effective monitoring of standards and these are important issues of patient confidentiality, which is a delicate matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must balance the need for accurate information for the purchaser with the confidentiality of patients, without allowing providers to use the latter as an excuse. I believe that such a delicate matter should be covered by statutory regulations. I shall not develop my argument further as I know that we wish to make progress, but I expect a positive response from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the central problems of the National Health Service. For more than 40 years, it has failed completely to provide itself, or anyone else, with the necessary information. We have now made immense strides towards doing something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like an assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister that the necessary information will be sought from the bottom up, rather than from the top down. Although we are discussing management information, there is no doubt that if it is collected by distant administrators and their staff, the professional staff will find it both difficult and unattractive to provide it. Administrators will ask for such information in terms that make little sense to the professionals from whom they wish to derive it. There is considerable goodwill among professionals in the NHS who want to know more about the service, its costings and genesis. It would be much better to provide professionals with cheap information technology which they can use to interact with one another, rather than having a massive top down information revolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to respond to the three contributions to the debate. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) spoke about financial management information systems. On 11 January we published working paper 11, which deals with the information requirements in the Health Service and the information technology support to it. I commend that document to interested hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman argued that the reports of the Select Committee on Social Services and of the National Audit Office, published this summer, suggested that we were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>277</span>
unable to build a satisfactory contracting system on the existing information costing system. I dispute that incorrect conclusion. We shall build our contracting system on the existing information system — the so-called Korner information system, which was named after the formidable lady who introduced into the National Health Service in England a new system of collecting data about patient activity and costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we shall use the existing information to introduce contracting from 1 April 1991. Only 26 hospitals are currently introducing the resource management initiative, which aims to involve clinicians in making decisions on resources. Much later, when we have the full benefit of the resource management initiative operating in 260 acute hospitals, we could then have a more sophisticated contracting system. It is on that point that the Select Committee on Social Services and the National Audit Office were perhaps mistaken. But at the outset the system will be relatively simple and straight forward, based on the existing information system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those of us who have examined the basis of contracting are worried that the National Health Service has the capacity to build a huge bureaucracy to monitor the contracts between various authorities. Will my hon. Friend assure the Committee that that will not happen and that all measures will be aimed at securing the most modern and efficient technology to monitor those contracts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's fear, but I am glad to tell him that I think that it is misplaced, that an army of bureaucrats will monitor the flow of contracts and paperwork.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) talked about compliance and monitoring. We have published a consultative document on the pricing and openness of contracts that discusses to what extent hospitals providing services to district health authorities should disclose fully their costs and the details of the contracts. We have received many responses to that document and shall make a decision in due course. The extent to which contracts
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>278</span>
must be transparent, looking beneath the prices at the underlying costs, and the extent to which details of the contracts will be open, will be decided by the Secretary of State for Health who will issue directions to the Health Service on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) made a plea about the amount of information required centrally by the Department of Health and by the National Health Service management executive. I share his views. We are determined to reduce the flow of paperwork upwards in the Health Service and have set in train a review, to be completed by 30 June 1990. That will require answers to questions, such as the question on creche facilities put by the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman), in the information provided to the Department of Health by district health authorities and hospitals. We shall start from the assumption that no information is required, unless thoroughly justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister glides blandly over a series of minefields. He ignores the evidence of the knowledge available throughout the Health Service. I regret his failure to respond positively to the opportunities provided by the amendments. During the remainder of our proceedings on the Bill I hope that the Minister will consider the points that have been made, otherwise we shall face some disasters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
