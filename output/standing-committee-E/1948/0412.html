The excepted dates are next Thursday and the first Tuesday when we resume, but I hope that we may make sufficiently good progress to enable us to conclude our proceedings this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two announcements for the information of the Committee. One is with respect to manuscript and starred Amendments. Adequate notice should be given of Amendments, as moving them without notice causes inconvenience. As a general rule I do not intend to call manuscript Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(ADDITION TO DEFINITION OF "CARE AND TREATMENT" IN RELATION TO INSANITY.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 5, at the beginning, to insert "Notwithstanding anything in." It will probably be for the convenience of the Committee if we consider this Amendment together with the next Amendment, in line 5, to leave out from "1937," to the end of the Clause, and to add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person shall be deemed for the purposes of section one hundred and seventy-six of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, to be under care and treatment—
	<ol>
	<li>while detained in pursuance of any order or warrant for his detention or custody as a lunatic under the Lunacy (Scotland) Acts,' 1857 to 1919;</li>
	<li>while detained in pursuance of any order for his detention or treatment as a person of unsound mind or a person suffering from mental illness made under any law for the time being in force in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man or any of the Channel Islands (including any such law relating to criminal lunatics); or</li>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1102</span>
	<li>while receiving mental treatment as a voluntary patient under the Mental Treatment Act, 1930, or under any such law as is mentioned in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of this subsection, being treatment which follows without any interval a period during which he was detained as mentioned in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) or paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of this subsection."</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be convenient to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of these Amendments is to provide that the rights of a spouse to divorce the other spouse on the grounds of insanity shall not depend upon where the other spouse may happen to have been detained in the British Isles. As the law now stands a court can grant a decree of divorce on proof that a person is of incurably unsound mind and that that person has been continuously under care and treatment for at least five years immediately preceding the petition. "Care and treatment" is defined, and one meaning of that phrase is detention pursuant to an order under the Lunacy and Mental Treatment Acts, 1890 to 1930; but if the detention is under the Lunacy (Scotland) Acts, that detention cannot count as part of the period of five years which it is necessary to establish for the purpose of obtaining a decree in the English courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will see that by subsection (	<i>a</i>) of the second Amendment it is intended to provide that in future detention under the Lunacy (Scotland) Acts shall count towards that period of five years. This is really only bringing the law of England into line with that of Scotland because detention under the Lunacy Acts of England counts if proceedings are brought in Scotland for divorce on grounds of insanity. No one will object to that. Subsection (	<i>b</i>) is intended to make the same extension with regard to Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. If we are to include the period of detention in Scotland, it seems a little illogical that detention in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or Northern Ireland should be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I need do more than draw attention to the fact that there is, in subsection (	<i>b</i>), the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"treatment as a person of unsound mind or a person suffering from mental illness …"</p></blockquote>
The inclusion of the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person suffering from mental illness"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1103</span>
does not extend the law at all. In this country, when a person is having temporary treatment and then an order is made for him to continue receiving that treatment, the detention for the period for the purpose of obtaining a divorce will start from the date of the making of the order. The effect of subsection (	<i>b</i>) is to provide that the same will happen in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. It cannot happen in Scotland because there is no provision there for voluntary treatment similar to the voluntary treatment under the 1930 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (	<i>c</i>) merely brings this part of this provision into line with the 1937 Act, which provided that voluntary treatment following immediately upon detention within the meaning of the Act could be counted towards the five-year period. These Amendments are therefore merely intended to make it possible to obtain a divorce for insanity even though the spouse happens to have been detained outside England but in some other part of the British Isles. I think that this proposal will be entirely uncontroversial. I hope no one will oppose it. It will do considerable good in a small number of cases, and it is a change in the law which is worth making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godfrey Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise not for the purpose of being a nuisance, but merely to point out that conditions in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are quite different from those in Scotland. In this Parliament we are not responsible for the law of the Channel Islands, or of the Isle of Man, but we are responsible for the law of Scotland. One can imagine a situation arising in which those Parliaments, quite outside our jurisdiction and control, make alterations in the law with which we do not agree. In passing a Clause like this we are, to some extent, putting ourselves into the hands of those Parliaments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my hon. Friend that we are not doing anything of the sort. I think he can take it from me, without my giving a long explanation, that that is not so. He will see that under paragraph (	<i>b</i>) detention does not count, unless under an order, and he need have no fears that we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1104</span>
legislating for control to pass away from this country in those respects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Sir Thomas Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is Eire treated under this Clause as a foreign country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Eire does not come within the scope of these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Alan Herbert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish entirely to support these Amendments, the necessity for which I know very well as a result of long correspondence for many years. There is a tiny drafting point I wish to raise. It may arise from the fact that the Amendment is in a different form from the original Measure. In paragraph (	<i>c</i>) should not the word be "section" and not "subsection"? However, that can be considered at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Frank Soskice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the Amendment, and I hope that my hon. Friends will be able to view it in the same way as I do. Its object has been fully explained. It rectifies anomalies in the law as it exists and I hope, therefore, that the Committee will agree to the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to take the opportunity of saying on behalf of my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General how sorry he is at not to be able to be here during the rest of this morning's proceedings, and to intimate on his behalf that he entirely supports not only this Amendment, but the other Amendments which appear on the Order Paper, and generally the purposes of the Bill. I know that he would desire me to say that on his behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the point raised by the junior Burgess for Oxford University (Sir A. Herbert), I understand it is the duty of the responsible clerk to see that subsections and Sections are put in their proper form and order when the Bill comes up for Report and Third Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Further Amendment made: In page 1, line 5, leave out from "1937," to end of Clause, and add:

Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, to be under care and treatment—
	<ol>
	<li>while detained in pursuance of any order or warrant for his detention or custody as a lunatic under the Lunacy (Scotland) Acts, 1857 to 1919;</li>
	<li>while detained in pursuance of any order for his detention or treatment as a person of unsound mind or a person suffering from mental illness made under any law for the time being in force in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man or any of the Channel Islands (including any such law relating to criminal lunatics); or</li>
	<li>while receiving mental treatment as a voluntary patient under the Mental Treatment Act, 1930, or under any such law as is mentioned in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of this subsection, being treatment which follows without any interval a period during which he was detained as mentioned in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) or (	<i>b</i>) of this subsection."—[	<i>Mr. Manningham-Buller.</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 2.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(POWER TO VARY ORDERS FOR MAINTENANCE IN THE EVENT OF REMARRIAGE.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 10, to leave out "subsection (2)," and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The power of the court under section four teen of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1938 (which provides for the discharge, variation or suspension of certain orders) shall be exercisable in relation to any order for the securing of a gross or annual sum made under subsection (1)."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment deals with a different point. Any order made for monthly or weekly payments by a husband to his divorced wife can 'be discharged, varied, or suspended by a subsequent order under the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1938. Curiously enough, there is no power at present to vary an order which is made for secured maintenance, not even though the lady in whose favour that order is made should have the good fortune subsequently to marry a millionaire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinnard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be a disaster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be a disaster, but the second husband might be a financial asset, at least temporarily, and it seems a little hard that the first husband should have to go on paying under an order for secured maintenance when it may be that the need for such maintenance has completely vanished. It would be convenient if we also considered the next Amendment, in line 11, to leave
	<span class='label label-info column'>1106</span>
out from "1925," to the end of the Clause, and to add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or any similar order made under any enactment repealed by the last-mentioned Act, in like manner as it is exercisable in relation to the orders mentioned in the said section fourteen.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) The powers exercisable by the court under the said section fourteen as amended by this Act in relation to any order shall be exercisable also in relation to any deed or other instrument executed in pursuance of the order."</p></blockquote>
These two Amendments would provide that there should be power of variation, and subsection (2) of the second Amendment is merely declaratory that the power should exist for the variation of an order for secured maintenance. Again, I hope that this matter will not be controversial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to support this Amendment. Its object has been explained, and we think it a useful Amendment. I would recommend my hon.

cation, order that any infant who is for the time being a ward of Court shall cease to be a ward of Court."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
It may surprise some hon. Members to know that any British infant can be made a ward of court by merely settling a small sum of money upon that infant and then starting an action to administer the trust. That can be done without the consent of either parent, and it can be done in relation to any child which is British. It may be that a child who has never visited this country can be made a ward of court by that simple operation under the law as it stands, without the consent of the court, and then all the consequences of being a ward of court will flow directly that child happens to be brought within these shores. Once a ward of court, as the law stands, always a ward of court until the child reaches the age of 21. It cannot thereafter be taken out of the jurisdiction without the consent of the court, and the court has control over the education and marriage of that infant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This procedure, which was originally intended to benefit the interests of the infant and to be for the protection of the infant, is liable to abuse and has been abused. It is possible, for instance, for a lady who has spent the whole of her life in a Dominion to come over here, leaving her husband and bringing the child of the marriage with her, and, by the simple action I have described, to make the child a ward of court, whereupon the husband will have great difficulty in getting the child hack to the country where it has been all its youth. The procedure as it now stands can be used as nothing more nor less than a trap, and, without notifying the child or the other parent it could be done at any time. For instance, where a husband invites his wife, from whom he was divorced, say, 10 years ago, to bring their child into this country for a short holiday of a fortnight or so, undertaking that he will pay all expenses, he can make the child a ward of court and make it impossible for the child to be taken out of the country back to the country where its home is, without the consent of the court first being obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of these Amendments is to ensure that that sort of abuse cannot be carried on in future and to ensure that while a child can be made a ward of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1108</span>
court by an application, that will not last long unless an order of the court is obtained. Whereas the application will have the effect of making the child a ward of court for a short period, that period will end unless the order of the court has been obtained and, of course, the court will have regard to the infant's interests. The proposed change carries out, in proper language, the provisions of Clause 3, which provides that if a child is to be a ward of court for a long period the consent of the court must first be obtained. It may be very important in the interests of the child that the court shall have power to terminate the period during which the infant is a ward of court. I am sure these Amendments will be welcomed in all branches of the profession. The Denning Committee reported in favour of the change and the Bar Council are also in favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not know whether my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) has considered that point and is satisfied with the position as it stands.

No explanation of this Amendment is necessary, except to say that I should require a greater degree of courage than I at present possess if I sought, in a Private Member's Bill, to make any alteration to the law of Scotland or of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is just 15 years since a case was brought to my notice of a lady in my constituency who, after the First World War, had married a Newfoundlander. As hon. Members may know, there is no divorce law in Newfoundland, and, when she went out there with her husband at the end of the war, she found that conditions were not altogether happy. Her husband came back to seek a job in Scotland, but he deserted her, went back to Newfoundland, married and now has six children. In all these 15 years, the wife has never been able to get a divorce in this country. A former childhood friend wanted to marry her, but is un-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1110</span>
able to do so. I have raised this case with every succeeding Law Officer for Scotland in the last 15 years, and have always been told that it was impossible for that woman to get a divorce. The only advice I was able to give her was to live in sin, and that she is doing today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had hoped that this Bill would remove that necessity and enable this woman to marry the man who has supported her for a considerable time. They are middle-aged people now, and they have had a long struggle. Now, to my intense resentment, I find that all the efforts I made on behalf of that woman in my constituency are of no avail, and that this admirable Bill, which in many ways corresponds to our general wishes, fails in this one vital respect. I can only imagine that the Lord Advocate will have something comforting and hopeful to say in this connection, and that he will give Scottish Members some encouragement to believe that there will be some modification of the law of Scotland so as to bring it into consonance with this Bill when it becomes an Act. We ought to hear something from the Lord Advocate before allowing this Amendment to pass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. John Wheatley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To get this question in its proper perspective, we have to look at the Bill as it was originally framed and at the Amendments to it which have now been tabled. The Bill as originally presented dealt only with certain minor procedural amendments of the law of England. In no way did it touch the law of Scotland, and even the larger Amendments which have been accepted by the Committee affect only the law of England. It would be very inappropriate, in a Private Member's Bill which is designed only to alter the law of England, to introduce any changes of a fundamental nature affecting Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Clause to which the hon. and gallant Member for Ayr Burghs (Sir T. Moore) has referred does introduce a certain fundamental change so far as jurisdiction in divorce is concerned. There again, it would be most inappropriate to introduce that fundamental change so far as Scotland is concerned in a Private Member's Bill which is designed to affect only the law of England. The hon. and gallant Gentleman must have recognised that his own proposal deals only with England, and it cannot have come as any great surprise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1111</span>
to him to find that this Amendment still confines the Bill to England. I imagine that he was under no illusion in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, it would be undesirable to introduce any changes of that nature into the law of Scotland without first having had an opportunity of consulting the various interested parties in Scotland to see to what extent the law of Scotland may be altered. It would be most inadvisable for me, without having had an opportunity of consulting the various interested parties in Scotland, to propose, either on my own initiative or in consultation with any hon. Members of the Committee, to make such alterations in the absence of such consultations and consideration. With that explanation, I hope the hon. and gallant Gentleman will be satisfied. I make no comment at all upon the advice which he took upon himself to give to the people living in sin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. and gallant Gentleman jumps a little too far.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect most hon. Members of the Committee, and all the legal Members, fully appreciate the effect of this Clause, and that most of them are familiar with the decision in the case of Russell v. Russell in 1924 in the House of Lords. That case decided that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a child which might have been conceived in wedlock has been born alive to the wife, neither the husband nor the wife is permitted, with the object of proving that the child is or is not the child of the husband, to give evidence showing or tending to show that they did or did not have sexual relations with each other at any time during wedlock when the child might have been conceived."</p></blockquote>
That is a statement taken from a leading textbook—Rayden on Divorce—and it correctly sets out the effect of that decision, which has been valid since 1924. Its effect has not been fortunate, because it has meant, not that evidence cannot be given of non-access, but that the parties have to incur great expense in proving non-access by calling other witnesses. The Denning Committee, in its final Report (Cmd. 7024), recommended that this rule in the case of Russell v. Russell should be abolished. It has also been recommended by the Bar Council and the Law Society, and I do not think there is any body of lawyers which would not now wish to see the rule which was established in that case rescinded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is dealt with in subsection (1) of the new Clause. The effect of this subsection is that the evidence of the husband or wife shall be admissible in any proceedings for divorce to prove that marital intercourse did or did not take place. When we make the evidence of a person admissible, there arises the question of whether that person can be compelled to give evidence, and we take the view that it would be quite wrong to say that either the husband or the wife should be compelled to go into the witness box and say "I have (or have not) had relations with my husband (or wife)," as the case may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) did in effect over-rule the decision of the Court of Appeal in a recent case, Tilley v. Tilley, which was decided in 1948, where it was held that the wife, in the circumstances of that case, at the instance of the co-respondent,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1113</span>
could be compelled to answer whether or not, after the commission of adultery with the co-respondent, she had had intercourse with her husband. If this new Clause is passed in its present form, the wife would not be compelled to give evidence in that way, and I think that would be a very good thing indeed. I, therefore, commend the new Clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to congratulate my hon and learned Friend on his wisdom in seeking to reverse the rule of law which has existed since the Russell case was decided. It would be improper to allow the discussion to proceed without mentioning the fact that the rule of law in the Russell case has never been accepted and has never operated in Scotland. Although I would prefer this to be made clear by the Lord Advocate, it should be on record that this is just one more of those instances where Scotland has given a very profitable and proper lead to England. As in many other cases, England is now prepared to alter the law or to bring the law of England into line with the operation of the law in Scotland, and I would like the Lord Advocate to confirm that that view is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These Private Members' Bills provide strange bedmates, and, for the first time in my career, I find myself in complete agreement with the hon. and gallant Gentleman. What he has just said is yet another illustration of the great missionary work which we do in Scotland. We show the light, and eventually it penetrates, and this is one of the instances of penetration. We should accept this admitted superiority of the Scottish law in this connection, and I suggest to English lawyers that if they look back further they will find many other cases in which they might profitably adopt Scottish law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment makes a very important change in the law and one which is well worthy of the support of everyone. I have known a fair number of cases in which it appeared that the parties did not get their rights because of the difficulty of this rule. I have known
	<span class='label label-info column'>1114</span>
of cases in which one has had to scratch round to find evidence likely to command sufficient weight in the court to prove access 	<i>aliunde.</i> I do not think that the evidence has always been very satisfactory, but the court has had to act on it to avoid obvious injustice.

	<li>Section fourteen of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1938 (which enables the court to discharge or vary certain orders for periodical payments) shall apply in relation to an order under this section as it applies in relation to the orders mentioned in that section.—[	<i>Mr. Selwyn Lloyd.</i>]</li></ol></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This again is an attempt to make a modest improvement in the law. It deals with the case of a husband who has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1115</span>
been guilty of wilful neglect to provide reasonable maintenance for his wife or the infant children of the marriage. At present the High Court has no jurisdiction to order the payment of alimony or maintenance unless proceedings have been instituted by the wife for divorce, nullity, judicial separation, or restitution of conjugal rights. It is true that magistrates can make an order, but their powers are limited to making it in the sum of no more than £2 a week for the wife and 10s. for each infant child. It may be that if a husband has only such an order against him he will escape the liabilities he ought to bear towards his wife and children, having regard to his financial position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to deal with that class of case that this new Clause is designed. It is in accordance with the recommendations of the Denning Committee on Procedure in Matrimonial Causes. Paragraph 46 of of that Committee's Report sets out what I have just stated to the Committee, and ends with these words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend, however, the more positive step of legislation on the one hand to enable the magistrates to order higher payments to meet the increased cost of living"—</p></blockquote>
this Clause does not attempt to deal with that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and on the other hand to enable the High Court to order payments up to any amount against a husband who has been guilty of wilful neglect to provide reasonable maintenance for his wife or her infant children without the necessity of proceedings for restitution."</p></blockquote>
In this new Clause we propose to give the High Court power to make such orders where it would have power to entertain proceedings by the wife for judicial separation. Unless the Committee wish me to, I shall not go into the technical reasons for giving jurisdiction in that class of case only. No doubt, one of the legal galaxy we have here will be able to satisfy any curiosity on that point. The rest of the Clause, I think, explains itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godfrey Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not represent the galaxy of legal talent but the galaxy of lay ignorance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a galaxy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1116</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is: I am here. This Clause will be the most important one of the Bill from the point of view of relieving hardship, of which so many examples have been brought, certainly to my notice since it has become known that I am a Member of this Committee. I should like to ask one or two questions about the Clause, and I hope that my hon. and learned Friends will forgive my ignorance. Some sort of proceedings have to be taken in the High Court before the court may make this order. I should like to know who institutes those proceedings, and what sort of proceedings they will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause says that the court may make an order if it
	<br><blockquote><p>"would have jurisdiction to entertain proceedings by the wife for judicial separation, …"</p></blockquote>
Will the wife be able to get legal aid for that? What guidance will be given to the court as to the amount to be allowed in the order? As my hon. and learned Friend has already said, a magistrates' court can make an order for £2 in respect of the wife and 10s. for every infant child. Is the court referred to in this new Clause to be guided about the proportion of the husband's income to be paid to the wife and children, to enable the wife to live according to the standard of life to which she has been accustomed? Who will lay down the rules, and who will give the guidance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) states that the court may order that the husband shall secure to the wife periodical payments. What steps will the court take to see that those periodical payments are secured? Such periodical payments often break down. There are scores, probably thousands, of deserted wives in this country who are not getting periodical payments. What steps will be taken to see that that sort of thing is not perpetuated? I think that from the point of view of the lay public this Clause should receive closer scrutiny, and be explained so that the lay Members of the Committee can understand it quite clearly, because I think that this Clause will relieve more hardship than any other Clause in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, I can help my hon. Friend, and those who feel any doubts about this new Clause, on those particular points. First, anyone who applies for maintenance under this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1117</span>
Clause would, under the provisions of another Bill, if it reaches the Statute Book—the Legal Aid and Advice Bill—be able to apply for legal aid with regard to making application. I cannot see that anyone can say whether the circumstances would be such that the legal aid available under that Bill would be granted; but it can be granted. I am sure my hon. Friend will take that from me, for I was a Member of the Committee that considered that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then my hon. Friend asked in what way the court would function when an application was made. The answer to that is, that it will function, presumably, in precisely the same way as it is functioning now in regard to maintenance and applications for alimony, which can only be made, however, after a petition has been put on the file, either for divorce, judicial separation or for restitution of conjugal rights, etc. The real effect of this Clause is to enable a wife who is suffering from neglect to maintain to go straight to the court without the necessity of putting on the file a petition of that sort, for she may not want such a petition, for it may lend to a termination of the marriage, whereas if she gets an order for maintenance it may be that reconciliation may be effected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point my hon. Friend raised was with regard to subsection (2), about security, and power being given to the court to order a husband, to the satisfaction of the court, to secure for the wife periodical payments. That is a very desirable provision, so that the court can—and, indeed, it can now, under the existing law—make an order that the payments which are to be made to the wife are to be secured, either by the execution of a deed or in some other way. One cannot get blood out of a stone, but a man who treats an order of the High Court with contempt is likely to find it a very painful process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all I can say to my hon. Friend on the point, but I hope that I have now been able to allay any fears he felt about this. I agree with him in thinking that this provision will be of great practical benefit to a great many people who are suffering from the fact that there is such a wide gap between what can be obtained in a police court, and the delay which is bound to take place now before any
	<span class='label label-info column'>1118</span>
maintenance is obtainable in the High Court. This Clause provides that the wife can go to the High Court for maintenance without first filing a petition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godfrey Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My other question was, What guidance will be laid down for the High Court as to the amount which will be allowed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had dealt with that by saying that the court will, no doubt, act upon the same principles as it now does in regard to alimony. It takes all the factors into account. It will take into account, indeed, the conduct of the wife. A wife who has committed adultery is not debarred from making application to the court. It is better to leave this flexible. It is flexible now. The same principles will be applied. This Clause does not alter the principles. I think that the Committee will agree that it is better to leave that power to the court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinnard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Member for Farnham (Mr. Godfrey Nicholson) for raising the questions which have now been answered to my satisfaction by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller). I am particularly glad that he has made it clear that what I thought was implicit here is the case, that a larger number of people will be able to make direct application to the High Court than at present. The average working woman does not fly to the courts. She looks to the security of her home, and particularly to the interests of her children, and hitherto she has been handicapped by the limitations of the magistrates' powers It seems to me that this is a very important step forward in the protection of family life. I am particularly pleased that the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Daventry has shown that there is no necessity to run the risk of a complete disruption of family relationships in order to obtain a reasonable degree of security through this new form of court order. For that reason, and having heard the explanations, I feel even more convinced that this Clause is worthy of support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any attempt to give increased powers to magistrates in that respect is, I am sorry to say, outside the scope of this Bill, which is merely to amend the law of divorce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marlowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a small drafting point I should like to put forward affecting subsection (1). It says there:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a husband has been guilty of wilful neglect to provide reasonable maintenance for his wife or her infant children. …"</p></blockquote>
I think that the reference should be to infant children of the marriage, rather than to "her" infant children. It is only a drafting point, but I think it should be made clear that the Clause refers to the children of the marriage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speaking for myself, and, I know, for the Attorney-General, who would also like to support this Clause, I support the Clause which has been fully explained by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) and the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller). I believe that my hon. Friends on this side of the Committee are fully aware of the purpose of this Clause. It is simply to avoid the necessity of the final step which may lead to termination of the marriage, which at present has to be taken before one can obtain payment of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can initiate proceedings, under which one can obtain payments, without taking the preliminary step of starting proceedings for divorce, nullity, judicial separation, or restitution of conjugal rights; can go to the court to ask for relief, which the new Clause provides for, without the necessity of that preliminary step. As the hon. and learned Member and my hon. Friend the Member for East Harrow (Mr. Skinnard) said, once that step is taken it is final, and leads to the final break-up of the marriage. That is now no longer to be the position; there is, at it were, this interim or halfway procedure which can be resorted to by a wife for whom the husband is not affording reasonable maintenance. For those reasons, I most cordially support this new Clause, and I know that my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General would also desire to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good deal was said about the importance of the previous new Clause. In my view this new Clause is perhaps even more important, or at least equally as important, as the last one we considered. The Committee will be aware that an English woman who marries a man whose domicile is outside England acquires by marriage the domicile of her husband, and that, apart from one exception made by the 1944 Act, in consequence of taking her husband's domicile she is debarred, in most cases, from recourse to the English courts for a divorce or a decree of nullity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attention was drawn to this—attention has been drawn to it more than once, of course—by the Denning Committee, which said, in paragraph 82 of its final Report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This rule acts with particular hardship on English women who marry men from the Dominions or from places abroad. A wife by law takes the domicile of her husband. If the marriage breaks down, her natural tendency is to remain with, or return to, her relatives in this country, but nevertheless in order to obtain a divorce, she has to proceed in the courts of the country where her husband is domiciled, and this is so even if they are both resident here."</p></blockquote>
The Report goes on to point out that the rule has been modified in a few cases under the Matrimonial Causes (War Marriages) Act, 1944, and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These modifications do not in our opinion go far enough. In particular, the 1944 Act does not meet the case where an English woman has married a man from over-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1121</span>
seas and after living with him a short time in his home land is deserted by him and, being left stranded, returns to her relatives in this country. As the law stands at present she cannot obtain a divorce here but has to go to his country for the purpose."</p></blockquote>
Well, that Report correctly states the law as it is today, but I hope that after the passage of this Bill, with the addition of this new Clause, that law will be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this new Clause will be that any English woman resident in this country, who has been ordinarily resident here for three years immediately preceding the commencement of proceedings, shall have recourse to the courts of England, even though her husband is domiciled outside England, provided that he is not domiciled in some other part of the British Isles. It is quite right to exclude that particular category, because Scotland has a law of its own, in which it naturally takes great pride, and there would be some difficulty in making this new Clause apply where the domicile of the husband is Scottish and that of the wife English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new Clause will deal with a large number of cases where, for instance, the wife has married someone—maybe of foreign nationality—whose home is in some far distant part of the world, where the marriage has broken up and the wife cannot get her freedom without making a journey to that distant and remote place. I myself think that this new Clause will make a very great improvement in the law. I am glad to know that it has the backing of, not only the Denning Committee but the Bar Council and the Law Society. I therefore commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although my name is appended to this new Clause, thus implying my support, I must again protest against its exclusiveness. I have made my point on that in the previous remarks I made, so I shall not go over it again. There is one point that I think the promoter of the Bill has perhaps ignored. In paragraph (	<i>b</i>) he says provided:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the husband is not domiciled in any other part of the British Islands."</p></blockquote>
In my submission that is a geographical error. Eire is pow included in the British Islands, so that the phrase should be "United Kingdom."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1122</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I admit I am not a lawyer—a regret which I share with a few of my hon. Friends—so I cannot determine the legal significance of either "British Islands" or "United Kingdom," but to my lay mind it seems obvious that "British Islands" is a geographical entity whereas "United Kingdom" is a political entity. Now, Eire is included in the geographical circumference of the British Islands, whereas Eire is not included in the political entity of the United Kingdom. This is important, because a great number of women will be affected by this new Clause—women who are married to Southern Irishmen and have hitherto been prevented, when the marriage has broken up, from getting the relief to which they might 'be entitled under this Bill if my submission is accepted. I think the promoter should say something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will say something about it at once, if it will help my hon. and gallant Friend. I think that he is quite wrong in saying the legal interpretation of the phrase "British Islands" now includes Eire. I do not think it does. I will certainly make further investigations to see if, by any chance, I am wrong. Perhaps my hon. and gallant Friend will be satisfied by my assurance to do that, if he is not satisfied by my expression of opinion that "British Islands" does not now include Eire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinnard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the hon. and learned Member to clear up a query I have in my own mind. I can see that this new Clause could do a great deal to alleviate the hardship caused to English girls who are known popularly as "G.I. brides." But what about the Englishman who, of malice aforethought, got demobilised outside this country in order that he should not return to his wife, and that she should have no further call on him? He has deserted her. Let me give a case I have in mind, of a man in Southern Rhodesia who has now disappeared up-country and cannot be found. The wife's divorce proceedings are stayed because they cannot find out where he is. Will this new Clause help English women married to Englishmen who have purposely disappeared in some other part of the world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, if the missing husband remains missing difficulties are bound to arise. Let me put what I think is the case the hon. Gentle-

	<span class='label label-info column'>1123</span>
man has in mind. Suppose the husband is domiciled in Southern Rhodesia and takes up residence there, so that it is known where he is. Suppose it can be established that he has no intention of returning to this country and is therefore domiciled in Southern Rhodesia. The answer then is that this new Clause will enable his English wife living here to obtain the divorce which she could not now get.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Crowder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has she to come back?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wife is here, but the husband who is in Southern Rhodesia, starts farming there, goes on living there, and makes it quite clear that he has no intention of returning here, and acquires domicile in Southern Rhodesia. If he does that, and if the wife satisfies the provisions of paragraph (	<i>a</i>), the wife will be able to go to the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinnard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suppose he has disappeared?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he disappears it may be very difficult to know whether he has abandoned English domicile, or to know what other domicile he has acquired. I am afraid that this new Clause will not cover the case where the husband is completely missing. There might be substituted service if he disappeared completely. Although I have not considered the point, I should say off-hand that he would still retain his domicile of origin, which would be his English domicile, so that his wife would be able to divorce him without this new Clause coming into effect at all. This new Clause comes into effect only where the husband has a domicile outside the British Islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinnard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suppose he acquires domicile outside the British Islands and then disappears?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Linstead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. and learned Friend enlighten me on the possible effect of this new Clause upon divorce proceedings by foreign nationals? The whole of his argument proceeded on the assumption that the wife at any rate was a British national; but the Clause
	<span class='label label-info column'>1124</span>
is drafted in exceedingly wide language, and I am wondering what would be the position if a wife who was a foreign national commenced proceedings in the British courts on the ground that she had been resident here for three years, and claimed that the court should have jurisdiction by virtue of the very wide wording of this new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I misled my hon. Friend. The wife resident in England need not necessarily be British; but she has to be resident here for three years immediately preceding the commencement of proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Linstead</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of this new Clause would be to confer upon a couple of foreign nationality the right to obtain divorce in the British courts so long as the wife had been resident here for three years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members here today will have received from time to time letters from their constituents bringing to their notice cases where wives cannot obtain redress because their husbands have obtained some foreign domicile, although their home is here. This new Clause will enable proceedings to be instituted by wives who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in that position. I know that I again speak for my right hon. and learned Friend in saying that we cordially support this Clause, having very carefully considered its implications. I sincerely hope that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. Herbert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask a question? I am very rusty on this subject.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We certainly have no intention of putting a new limitation upon the law of nullity, and I do not think the Clause does so in any shape or form. There may be some need for a slight alteration in drafting on the Report stage in one of the earlier Clauses in relation to nullity, and that may be the point which the junior Burgess for Oxford University (Sir A. Herbert) has in mind. This interpretation Clause is most necessary and most desirable because it has reference to the Clause dealing with evidence of access, and without the Clause a husband or a wife would not be able to give evidence of non-access in a nullity case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Also my appreciation of the very great help I have received in the drafting of the new Clauses from the Parliamentary draftsmen, drafting which has been extremely difficult and technical and which has taken a great deal of consideration. I do not wish to limit my expression of gratitude to them because, although I introduced it in the House, the Bill is really of very mixed parentage. While I could not accuse the Attorney-General of being a parent, he would certainly fall

It has often been my experience since I became a Member of Parliament to hear remarks of a very different character thrown at the Parliamentary draftsmen, who cannot very well defend themselves, and it has been my task to defend them. I have always felt that they were dead right, and I am sure they always are. They have always given me the greatest possible assistance, and it is a great pleasure to me to hear them at last given a word of praise which they so well deserve.
