<p><span class='member'>Sir Dymoke White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move:
<br><blockquote><p>"That in the event of the proceedings on the Docking and Nicking of Horses Bill not being completed at this day's Sitting the Committee do meet To-morrow at half-past Ten o'clock and at Four o'clock."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(PROHIBITION OF DOCKING AND NICKING EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CASES.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 5, to leave out from "the," to "prohibited,' in line 6, and to insert "operation of docking horses is."<br><br>
This Amendment and the next Amendment to page 1, line 7, leave out "or of nicking." go together, and both seek to leave out all reference to nicking in the Bill. I do not think there are many people in this room who have ever seen a horse nicked. I have not, and I have been advised by the Government Department concerned that it would be difficult for the Customs and Excise to enforce the prohibition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite prepared to believe that it would be difficult to enforce the abolition of nicking, but surely nicking is purely a fashion, if anything is. In moving the Second Reading of this Bill the hon. Member for Fareham (Sir D. White) was much opposed to anything being done simply for fashion which might be painful to the horse, and this Amendment completely undermines the whole of his argument at that time. While it is right that this Committee should not try to legislate for anything which cannot be enforced, I think that protest should be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier Thorp</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I reinforce what my hon. and gallant Friend has said. If nicking is now to be left out altogether it was wrong to bring it in in the first place if, as the promoter of the Bill has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1460</span>
said, he has never known or seen a nicked horse. Why was this put in if it does not occur?. I believe that on the Continent there is a good deal of nicking for show purposes, and if we want to try to set an example in this country against that habit, which causes cruelty, it seems wrong to leave it out of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ivor Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a complete ignoramus about this except for riding the beasts, so perhaps I ought not to ask this question: if docking is prohibited and nicking permitted, might there not be an increase in nicking?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope not. I understand that the practice has practically died out in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But might not the law as it is now being amended lead to an increase in the practice of nicking?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should hope not. I do not think heavy horses are nicked; I believe the practice is restricted to certain light horses. I heard one hon. Member say on Second Reading that he had ridden a nicked horse jumping at Olympia before the war, and was rather ashamed of doing so. I have seen pictures of hackneys that have been nicked but I understand that then they do not dock the horse and it has a permanent arch, but I have never seen any.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinnard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like hon. Members opposite I am puzzled why, at this late stage, we should eliminate the reference to nicking. It is certainly a fashion which was practised for various horse shows in the South West of England not so long ago to induce smartness. If we do not say something in the Bill, there is always the chance of a recrudescence of what is after all a cruel fashion. I hope that this point can be reconsidered so that we indicate in no uncertain terms our disapproval of both forms of cruelty.</span></p>
<p>Question, "That the words proposed to be left out, stand part of the Clause," put, and negatived.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be for the convenience of the Committee if I explain that this Question has to be put in two parts. The first part has the effect of leaving out the words "operations of docking and of nicking of horses are." Insofar as the words have been left out, the second part of the Amend-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0760">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1461</span>
ment, if voted in the affirmative, will have the effect of inserting the new words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ridealgh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Are we voting to put in the words "operation of docking horses is," or are we leaving the Clause as it is?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise for any lack of clarity. The Question before the Committee is whether the words "operation of docking horses is" be inserted in the Clause as it is now amended. The Clause is now amended to the effect that the words proposed to be left out have been left out, and the Question before the Committee now is whether the words "operation of docking horses is" be inserted in the amended Clause,</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dryden Brook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of Order. My impression is that most hon. Members were completely wrong as to their first voting. I am under the impression that most hon. Members around me wish to retain the word "nicking" in the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that if that is the wish of hon. Members it would be better if they postpone voting until we move the next Amendment to line 7.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill reads at the moment Clause 1 reads: "Save as hereinafter provided, the prohibited." I do not know whether the hon. Member in charge of the Bill would care to move the suspension of the Sitting for the purpose of putting forward a manuscript Amendment, or would prefer to move a manuscript Amendment straight away?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move:
<br><blockquote><p>"That the Sitting be suspended for a quarter of an hour."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>There seems to have been a muddle and we cannot leave the Clause as it is.</p>
<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended accordingly</i>.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1462</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must be quite clear about this. The Committee has voted. I have given my opinion, which has not been challenged, and the first part of the Amendment has been made. At a later stage hon. Members will have an opportunity if they wish to make a further alteration. The Second part of the Amendment is about to be divided on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In other words, nicking is out of the Bill as you have Ruled, Mr. Diamond?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is not for me to lead the Committee in any way, but perhaps I shall be excused for pointing out that inasmuch as nicking is now out of the Bill, a vote of "No" on the second Question would make sheer nonsense of the Clause. It is open to hon. Members, of course, to vote "Aye" or "No" as they may think fit, and I merely make that remark for the purpose of assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. I. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case nicking is not out of the Bill, but out of Clause 1, page 1, line 5?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</span></p>
<p>Question put, "That the proposed words be there inserted."</p>
<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 5; Noes, 10.</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>:</p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in line 5, after "the", to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"docking or nicking of horses is."</p></blockquote>
I am sorry for this little upset, and I must take the blame, as I am very new to this business. It is a manuscript Amendment which I am moving, and I hope that it will put the matter right. What the promoters of the Bill want to do is to prohibit the docking and nicking of horses in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have only one comment to make, and that is that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0761">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1463</span>
Amendment does not exactly put back the wording which was in the Bill before, because it now talks merely about docking and nicking and not the operations of docking and nicking. I do not know whether the difference in phraseology is deliberate, but I should have thought that this should refer to the operation, and that we really should have the right wording.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could help the Committee. The Committee having decided to reject certain words, it would not be in order for the Committee thereupon to reinsert those identical words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. I. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it is clear from Clause 3 that the difference in wording makes no difference to the Bill. Docking is defined there as:
<br><blockquote><p>"the deliberate removal of any bone or any part of a bone from the tail of a horse."</p></blockquote>
That is the operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I put the Question may I presume to read the Clause as it now is and as it will be if the Committee vote "Aye". At the moment the Clause reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Save as hereinafter provided the prohibited."</p></blockquote>
If the Committee vote "Aye", it will read:
<br><blockquote><p>"Save as hereinafter provided the docking or nicking of horses is prohibited."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 17, at the end, to add:
<br><blockquote><p>(4) Nothing in this section shall prohibit or make unlawful, or render any person liable to any penalty in respect of the docking of any heavy horse in accordance with the Animals (Anaesthetics) Act, 1919, or any statutory modification or re-enactment of that Act for the time being in force.</p></blockquote>
I did not take any part in the Second Reading proceedings, and I feel that I owe the Committee an explanation. I should like to make it clear that I think docking is a very unpleasant thing that has to be done in certain cases. I have seen it in a military capacity and in a civil one, and I should say that where docking is done solely from the point of view of fashion it is quite reprehensible and that there is no justification for it. I felt that when this Bill was presented to Parliament it would probably meet with considerable sympathy from all parts of the House, as I believe it has, and that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1464</span>
was certainly one which I should feel it would be right in principle to support.<br><br>
At the same time I felt that farmers might have a different point of view, and very soon after it was presented on 28th January, I did get in touch with my local farmers' union but at that time all I could get was an expression of opinion by the secretary that he thought that probably most people would object to the idea that there should be no more docking—in the Fens anyway—but that there had not been a meeting of the union about it. Unfortunately that meeting was not held until after the Second Reading. In the meantime I had a word with the promoter of the Bill, and I informed him that I thought my local farmers' union might be opposed to it. He told me that he understood that the breed societies were not objecting, and were rather glad that a decision was to be made either way. I passed that back to my local farmers' union, and they definitely protested at once, but unfortunately, that protest did not arrive before the Second Reading. Had it done so, I should have said then pretty much what I am saying today in Committee.<br><br>
I wish to make that one comment on the hon. Member who moved this Bill on Second Reading, because he did say, as reported in col. 751 of the OFFICIAL REPORT on 4th March,
<br><blockquote><p>"I have received no objections from any source since this Bill was published."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 4th March, 1949; Vol. 462, c. 751.]</p></blockquote>
I accept his assurance, but I think he will recall that I did mention to him what my local people were feeling, and on the day of the Second Reading I did say that I had not had a definite confirmation one way or the other. Naturally there is a general feeling that docking ought to be prevented, certainly so far as riding horses are concerned, and horses which are docked only for show purposes, but we have to ask ourselves whether what we are doing will interfere with the working of horses by people who know far more than we know about the problem. It is because I am convinced that there is a case to be made out on those grounds that I am moving this Amendment.<br><br>
I am impressed by the unanimity of opinion which exists in the breed societies. The Under-Secretary of the Home Office was good enough to receive a deputation

from the breed societies, which I attended, and he did hear their case. I do not want to weary those who know the case very well by putting it all over again, but I do think these figures, which were not known at the time, should be known. The Shire, Clydesdale, Suffolk, and British Percheron horse societies each circulated all their members with a view to finding out how many were opposed to the Bill or in favour of it. The Shire Horse Society, with a membership of 3,500, has eight members who took the trouble to write in and say they were in favour of the Bill. In the case of the Clydesdale Society, with a membership of 3,500, six members wrote to say they were in favour. Out of 1,000 members of the Suffolk Society five wrote in, and. in the case of the British Percherons, again five wrote out of a membership of 1,000. In other words, over 99 per cent. of the members of the heavy breed societies have not opposed the action which those societies took in approaching the Home Secretary and myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many have objected to the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave the figures of those who have written in to say that they approved of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member saying that only 1 per cent. have written in to object?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears that less than 1 per cent. have written in to say they are in favour of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. and gallant Member read to us exactly what question was put to the members, what information was asked for?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have here the letter which one of the heavy horse societies, the Shire Horse Society, sent round to its members, and I think that it would be only fair to read it:
<br><blockquote><p>"Docking and Nicking of Horses Bill. 'You may be aware that this Bill, now before Parliament, would make it illegal (except in case of injury or disease certified by a qualified veterinary surgeon), under pain of a penalty of £25 and</p></blockquote>/<br><blockquote><p>or three months' imprisonment, to dock or nick any horse. It is also proposed to prohibit the importation into the United Kingdom of all docked or nicked horses. This Society, in collaboration with the other Heavy Horse Societies (Clydesdale, Suffolk and British Percheron) has taken
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1466</span>
steps to draw attention to the very weighty objections to prohibiting docking of the working heavy horse, and to the very serious results which it is feared would inevitably follow the passing of the Bill into law in its present form. It is now proposed to take further steps to oppose the Bill in Parliament, with the support of the members of this Society; and it is accordingly desired to ascertain their views on the matter. I shall be very much obliged, therefore, if you will let me know, as early as possible, whether you are in favour of, or against, the docking of heavy horses. Unless I hear from you within fourteen days it will be assumed that you are not in favour of the Bill and that you wish the Society to oppose it by all means within its power. The grounds which the Society propose to put forward in opposition are shortly set out overleaf. If you approve the action which the Society is taking you can assist by writing to your local Member of Parliament (at the House of Commons, London, S.W.I), enlisting his support in opposing the Bill."</p></blockquote>
Having read that, I had better put before the Committee the statement which accompanied that letter, setting forth the objections to the Bill at the headquarters of the breed society itself. They are:
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) increased accidents, especially on the farm, caused by reins getting under un-docked tails, particularly where teams are worked with single lines.
<ol>
<li>increased accidents, due to long tails getting caught in tip carts, chains, etc.</li>
<li>sore docks due to contact with shafts or other parts of carts or implements, and to dirt and grit picked up (especially in winter) by a long tail.</li>
<li>increased difficulties in getting labour to work undocked horses and extra work and time in grooming them.</li>
<li>discouragement of the use of the heavy horse, owing to extra risk of accidents and work involved, and consequential decline in working horse population, loss of land fertility, etc., which would be in direct conflict with the expressed policy of the Government.</li>
<li>insufficient advantage to the horse itself, inasmuch as the tail could be close clipped and the animal thereby deprived of the means to deal with flies (the preservation of which means is said to be the principal reason for the Bill), while the practice of plucking or thinning an undocked tail can be extremely painful to the horse and may itself result in sore or tender docks."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That was what the Shire Horse Society sent out to all its members, and I think it is in line with the letters and memoranda sent out by the other breed societies to their members. As regards the reins getting under the tail, it can be argued that if a line or rein gets underneath a docked tail it can cause that horse to start kicking and probably to injure itself, but I think what we have to accept is that when a horse has been docked there is less chance of the line
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0763">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1467</span>
getting under the tail than there is when the tail has been left long. I think that is an objection which has been raised in the past to the case put up on behalf of farmers to the effect that the line getting under the tail is one of the major dangers. On the matter of cleanliness, it is perhaps forgotten that the horse-keeper is on the decline, quite definitely, in the countryside. In other parts of England he is known by a different name, but in the Fens he is the horse-keeper. Some farmers find it difficult to get any horse-keeper. There is no doubt that in nine cases out of ten a horse-keeper who was asked for his opinion would say that he would prefer to look after a docked horse than an undocked horse, because a tail does require a good deal of attention, especially in areas where the ground becomes very muddy in winter. The tail can be plaited, but if a horsekeeper is looking after a good number of horses he might have to spend the best part of a couple of hours before his day's work has begun in plaiting horses' tails. There is nothing worse, in my military experience, than leaving a horse with its tail plaited indefinitely. The tail should be left free to allow the air to get into it, and by leaving it plaited one is inviting a form of dirtiness in horse management which is quite unpermissible to anyone who has the welfare of horses at heart. There is the danger of getting lice in the tail unless it is well washed out. I do not know if hon. Members know what a Fen drove looks like in Winter-time. I have had letters saying how difficult it is to get horses down a drove in these times and when they are used in Winter-time a horse's tail has often to be washed out.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member who moved the Second Reading of the Bill said that the main purpose of docking was fashion and for the purpose of showing horses. I cannot agree with that. To my mind there is no question that originally it was done to keep the tail out of the way in farm work and also for military use. Only when horse shows began to be held and farmers wanted to show their horses did horses with docked tails come into the shows. I think it wrong to say that it was originally done because of fashion. Incidentally, the word "dock" is, I understand, an Icelandic word which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1468</span>
means a short tail. Probably in Iceland they cut them because of ice and snow as we do in the Fens because of mud, and it is a practical operation. It would be a great mistake to assume that all people who dock their horses in rural areas are doing so purely in order to be able to show them. I am absolutely convinced that is not the case.<br><br>
I fully accept that most of the horses in the show ring are docked, but that does not prove that they are docked in order to get into the show ring; in fact, I know they are not. I ask the Committee to believe that there is a very real problem for the farmer to get his labour and to avoid having accidents on his farm and keeping his horse in a clean condition, particularly in regard to its tail.<br><br>
One point I should also mention is the matter of flies. In the Second Reading Debate hon. Members mentioned the fly muscle. It is true that the fly muscle covers the majority of the body, certainly all the body which a full-length tail will not reach. I have had considerable experience of horses suffering from flies because, in 1940, we went out to Palestine with our horses and they became more out-of-date every day that we stayed there. I can assure hon. Members that we had some docked horses, in fact I had one, for many uses, and they managed to get through that period. I grant that they must have suffered something, and I believe that if we had let the hair grow long they would not have suffered so much as they did. But they got through and got used to it. When they first went on the open horse line shackled by one leg, we found they were very irritable to begin with, but, after about a month, they acted exactly as horses with long tails. We must not overlook the fact that there are now dressings which can be put on to keep flies away to some extent, although in my experience nothing will keep away the horse fly, neither a long tail nor anything else. If he makes up his mind that he is to bite, he will do so.<br><br>
A few days ago I was driving through my constituency and saw four young Suffolk horses turned out. All had been docked and the hair on the tails had been allowed to grow after docking. It was the sort of day that we have been having in the last three weeks or so and there were many flies about and practically no wind. It was blazing hot, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0764">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1469</span>
the horses were grazing in the field perfectly quietly and seemed able to flick off their backs all the flies which they could not get away by means of the fly muscle.<br><br>
I am convinced that these farmers have a very real case. The Ministry of Agriculture have put forward a strong plea to encourage horse breeding and I have heard the Minister congratulate the breed societies on the work they have done in improving the breeds. The breed societies are convinced that they are right in docking. If some hon. Members feel that perhaps the way they went about obtaining the opinion of their members was a little rushed, I am certain that my own farmers and others in other constituencies did not know that the Bill was coming on when it did. Some of the breed societies' headquarters had considered it, but the ordinary members in the constituencies had not realised it was coming on as soon as it did. They have been given an opportunity of saying that they approve and I have given the number who say they approve of the Bill. I hope the Committee will feel that it is right at this time—I do not say for ever—for us to exclude the heavy horses of the pedigree stock such as those administered by breed societies.<br><br>
May I touch on the subject of foals and old horses? I am assured by my local farmers' union, and it is certainly the custom in the Isle of Ely, that when foals are born in the Summer their tails are left on until the end of the Summer to help them through the fly period. There is no question that docking can be carried out quite painlessly, and the Section of the Anaesthetics Act to which reference has been made makes it illegal to dock without a general or local anaesthetic, rendering the whole operation painless to the horse. I hope hon. Members will realise that the operation is painless. I hope I have convinced the Committee in regard to old horses by the illustration I gave of the four Suffolks I saw the other day, that allowing the hair of the docked tail to grow and cover that part of the back not covered by the fly muscle is the rule. It ensures that the old horse does not necesarily suffer misery when turned out in its old age. I ask the Committee, as a practical proposition, to accept the Amendment because I believe it is essential for the cause of agriculture at the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1470</span>
moment, although I believe that perhaps at some future time we may find some way of overcoming these difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. M. Philips Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite prepared to admit that, certainly as far as convenience, the passage of this Bill will make it more difficult for farmers under certain conditions concerning the use of horses on the farms. But I feel there is no excuse whatever for insisting upon those conditions and inflicting what we are forced to the conclusion is a certain amount of suffering on the animal. There is no excuse for that, even if it means a little more difficulty in the management of horses under certain conditions. Nor am I so much impressed by the statistics and arguments which the hon. and gallant Member for the Isle of Ely (Major Legge-Bourke) has given in regard to the position in the Fens. I cannot believe that conditions in the Fens are so different from those in other parts of the country. Indeed, I have heard that there a large percentage of the horses are not docked. I have heard that half the horses in the Fens are not docked now. I do not think farmers can be so keen on docking as the hon. and gallant Gentleman suggests. The figures he read, and the type of answer received to the questionnaire, rather prove that.<br><br>
Farms are more mechanised now, and I have only one horse, whereas I formerly had six and I have four tractors and formerly had none. But I have frequently driven a horse on a side rake, or an ordinary rake, and known what it is to get the driving rein under the tail. It is a nuisance, but if one holds the rein in a certain way one can generally avoid the trouble. Generally it happens when one is watching something else for a moment and lets the rein get loose so that the tail comes over it. One has to be continually watching and keep one's attention on driving. If it does happen one has to stop the horse, get down and lift the rein over the tail and start again. It means a little more trouble. One can have trouble with a tip cart. When the cart is tipped back the rein may come under the horse's tail. One has to see that it is slowly tilted back and that all is clear. There is more trouble about keeping the horse's tail clean and it can get very dirty, but, if one keeps the horse, one must look after it and do everything possible to avoid any kind of cruelty. The curse of flies at a time like this is so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0765">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1471</span>
great that there is no trouble which is too much to be taken to prevent this suffering. The hon. and gallant Gentleman certainly put his case extremely well and I congratulate him on it, but he has not convinced me and I do not think he has convinced the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier Thorp</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Isle of Ely (Major Legge-Bourke) put down the Amendment, because we must look at the matter from a realistic point of view. The point is whether we are going to lose more horses off agricultural land which, I understand, is against the wishes of the Minister of Agriculture. I have not had the experience of horses that my hon. Friend the promoter of the Bill has had, but I have been with them all my life. I admit I have not actually had an accident by getting a rein under a horse's tail, but I can assure hon. Members that getting something under a horse's tail cannot always be prevented by the word "Whoa." I remember on occasions when my polo stick caught underneath the pony's tail and it did not stop it. In fact, I remember occasions when the only answer when I was on my back was to pull the polo stick out. Naturally, I would not oppose the Bill on that ground. I want only to get a realistic view in the case of horses working on farms.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member for the Forest of Dean (Mr. Philips Price) mentioned that he did not think the Fens were very different from other parts of the country. I do not know about that. I know the Fens slightly, but I know my own part of Northumberland better. If he will come with me he will find it very hard to find a cart horse or a horse working on a farm, either cross-breed or thoroughbred, that has not been docked. Therefore, up in Northumberland, where it may not fee such deep going as in the Fens, the farmers and the workers think it is necessary to have the horses docked. I admit that in probably all cases hair is allowed to grow on the dock, which covers most of the area which the fly muscle does not cover.<br><br>
As regards keeping horses clean the hon. Member for the Forest of Dean was applauded when he said that when a horse is kept it should be looked after.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1472</span>
I could not agree more with him. but in these days of shortage of labour and lack of knowledge of horses, it is not always easy for the owners to impress that necessity on the people who actually tend the animals. The cleaning of a horse's tail to keep lice away is a big job. I have a great deal of experience of that, because the horses in my regiment, which hon. Members have often seen on the streets of London, always had to have their tails in absolutely perfect condition. This business of washing a horse's tail is not like washing one's hands before going to lunch. It is a much bigger job than that. That has to be done to keep the lice away. Most hon. Members would agree that the streets of London are slightly better than the Fens, but when horses came off an exacting parade or guard duty the bottoms of their tails had to go into (buckets of warm water to get the dirt of London's streets off them. It is not an easy job to keep a horse's tail in good condition.<br><br>
The possibility which may occur if we prohibit docking, and if the farmer and the farm worker see they must get away from the trouble of keeping the tails clean, is that horses' tails may be completely shaved, which seems a reasonable solution. I believe I am right in saying that if that is done then the horse's tail without any hair on it at all except the short bristles will not reach those parts which can be reached even by a docked tail with long hairs on it. Therefore, it would seem to me to be necessary when considering the matter properly to remember that we may possibly be increasing the amount of cruelty that may be inflicted on the horses when they are turned out.<br><br>
There is a great deal in what was said by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Isle of Ely, and although I am not going to oppose anything which is likely to do away with cruelty to horses, I feel that this matter wants a little consideration. I am not sure that we have not rushed into this Bill too quickly, and that we ought to have a Committee to study the whole question, particularly from the point of view of the farmer and farm workers, before it is put into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Skinnard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great attention to the closely reasoned arguments of the hon. and gallant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0766">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1473</span>
Gentleman the Member for the Isle of Ely (Major Legge-Bourke) and it seems to me that he had not made out his case. He made a great plea for one particular part of the country, where farming in winter is extraordinarily difficult, but to us in this Committee the main question is whether there is any cruelty which we can end by this Measure, and the onus should be on the farmers to see how they can reconcile more humane treatment of their horses with their effective use. The hon. and gallant Gentleman spoke with certain considerations in mind—I quite admit that I do not speak with the same knowledge of horses as he does—and I tried to see what answer there could be to the argument that he was putting forward, and at the same time retain the presence and usefulness of the heavy horse on the land.<br><br>
The hon. Member for the Forest of Dean (Mr. Philips Price) answered the first point, which was the difficulty of preventing the reins from getting under undocked tails, which can cause pain and even accident. The whole of the argument of the hon. and gallant Gentleman seemed to be rather an indictment of careless drivers than a plea that docking would prevent the difficulties, however great. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals answered that argument by quoting from the book "Army Horses in Russia," by the late Captain Hayes:
<br><blockquote><p>"When a horse gets a rein under his tail he is unable to retain it there, unless it is closer to the root of his tail than the point of amputation would be."</p></blockquote>
I feel that with the diminution of the heavy horse population perhaps the difficulty of training drivers will not be as great as the hon. and gallant Member suggests.<br><br>
The tip cart position was also mentioned. There I do not think that the hon. and gallant Member was on such firm ground for the whole of his argument seemed to be that it was necessary to cut the horse's tail to suit the cut of the cart, rather than the other way about. When one is purchasing a vehicle for trotting purposes to enable a horse to put over its best paces, one is very careful to make the trotting vehicle light and convenient to the horse. I feel that it would be fantastic in this Committee to accept
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1474</span>
the proposal, that because tip carts are unsuitable for their purpose we should therefore re-shape the horse to comply with the deficiencies of the cart. I Would rather proceed on the analogy of the trotting horse whose vehicle is adapted to his build and pace.<br><br>
I have seen undocked heavy horses in use on farms, and while the tail was comparatively long a clip was applied to its sides. The reason for that, I understand, was, to make the process of cleaning against lice, mud and the natural dirt of the road easier to achieve. That is a way out. It is true that today a very large proportion of farmers who still use heavy horses no longer have them docked. It is natural to expect farmers, who have bought docked horses at considerable expense, to have a feeling that docking is a sort of natural corollary to possessing and working such horses.<br><br>
I feel that on the balance of the argument I shall have to vote against the Amendment, because the object of this Bill is not to facilitate farming, but to ensure the most humane use of animals in fanning as in other spheres of equine activity. While I congratulate the hon. and gallant Member on putting forward such a very reasoned case, I must add that it was a case for the farmer rather than for the horse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to support the Amendment, although we should be grateful to the hon. and gallant Member for having presented this case for the other side. I know there is a certain anxiety amongst farmers over this matter. Personally, I think they are misinformed and misled. Some of them feel that it is the thin edge of the wedge, and, if this Bill is passed, another will be brought in to prevent the docking of lambs' tails and so on. I do not believe there is any cause for alarm.<br><br>
The first point brought up in support of the Amendment was the danger to the horses themselves and to the horseman through the tail being caught in tip carts. I cannot remember a case of a horse being injured in that way. I represent an agricultural constituency, I have a number of farms, some of them in hand, and also I am a master of hounds. Horses which have had accidents are brought in to my hounds, and I cannot remember a case of one brought in injured and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0767">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1475</span>
having to be destroyed because of having its tail caught in a tip cart or any other way through its tail being too long. At breakfast this morning I had with me a man rather older than agent, who all his life has been a land steward. I asked him about it, and he said he could remember one case but not more. These cases are not very frequent.<br><br>
In the case of young and restless horses where there might be a danger, if the hair were cut off level with the natural dock the danger would be avoided. I know, of course, that we would be destroying a great deal of the fly protection without the opportunity of replacing that protection if the end of the natural tail be removed. Hair grows very much quicker. As long as it is there and the horse is allowed to grow it, the hair will grow in a month. It is not pretty but is quite effective. The object can be achieved by cutting off the hair level with the dock, and in that case I do not think there is any danger at all from the tip cart.<br><br>
The same thing applies in the winter when there is a great deal of mud. At least it can be cut short then, and allowed to grow more in the summer when there is not so much mud about. One thing I resist is the suggestion of the hon. and gallant Gentleman that there is more mud in the Fens than elsewhere. There is just as much in the clay lands on which I live in Sussex, and if we can keep the tails in Sussex clean they ought to be able to do it in the Fens.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear the confirmation from the hon and gallant Member of the point I was making. I was speaking from my own personal knowledge, and I felt I was entitled to do that, and no more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would not be right if I continued to talk about the mud in the fens, Mr. Diamond. However, once one goes upfield and gets on to the higher clay land, I agree there is a pretty good lot of mud. While it is right that this Amendment should be considered, no case has been made for resisting the Clause as it stands, and I do not think that this matter has been rushed, as was suggested by the hon. and gallant Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Brigadier Thorp),
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1476</span>
because this is not the first time the Bill has been before the House. For those reasons I hope the Amendment will not be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Sir Thomas Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise to my hon. and gallant Friend for not being here to listen to his speech, but I have not yet reached that pitch of perfection which the Selection Committee demands, of being able to sit on two Committees at the same time. I would like to take up the point made by the hon. and gallant Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Brigadier Thorp). This Bill was printed first in 1938. It went through the House of Lords and it was printed again in 1939 in exactly the form in which it is printed today. Therefore the Shire Horse Society, and every other horse society which has perhaps inspired my hon. and gallant Friend to put down this Amendment, has known the contents of the Bill for 10 years, and it is only in the last two or three days that it has been found necessary to produce this Amendment. I ask the Committee to consider this in its reality, as the hon. and gallant Member suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier Thorp</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not complaining about rushing the Bill. All I asked at the end was, why could we not have had a tribunal between 1938 and now to consider both aspects?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir T. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason was because there was no necessity. There was no opposition to the Bill. Only in the last few days has the Shire Horse Society opposed the Bill. Had the Society opposed it ten years ago we would no doubt have had the tribunal and have elicited the information necessary to settle the doubts of my hon. and gallant Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier Thorp</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What happened to the Bill in the House of Lords?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It got as far as the Report stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir T. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that satisfies the Committee in regard to the time that this Bill has been before the country, the various horse societies, the farmers and the general public. They have known about the Bill all along, and no oppositon has manifested itself until the last few days.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0768">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1477</span>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tried to make it clear that we should be quite certain why the breed societies did not make any public protest sooner. They could not have known about the Bill until 28th January, when it was published. They did not know that the hon. Member who promoted this Bill would use exactly the same phraseology. I think they were right, before coming out publicly with any declaration about the Bill, to try to find out what their members thought about it, which is what they did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir T. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that dubious defence. Reference has been made this morning to the cruelty involved in docking. I would not go so far as to say that it is actual cruelty. I have been associated with horses since I was born, and I think that acute discomfort is caused by docking. Why should we not give the same privileges to the horse as we seek for ourselves? If the arguments of my hon. and gallant Friends are correct, we would deny the horse everything except that which is strictly utilitarian. We would dock his tail, his mane, his forelock. We would probably take his ears off if they were not purely utilitarian. The argument taken to its logical conclusion is fantastic, so I ask the Committee to reject the Amendment.<br><br>
With regard to the cleaning of horses' tails, it was done long before the hackney fashion was introduced into this country. Farmers, farm-workers, horse owners, masters of hounds and soldiers have cleaned their own horses' tails and have rejoiced that they were able to do something to repay the horse for the pleasure he gave them. How many times have we come off parade and the first job was to see that the horses were comfortable and happy. It is a policy of laziness—that is what it comes to—and our country is getting far too much inclined to adopt a policy of laziness in dodging uncomfortable work. It is not a pleasant job to clean a horse's tail—I have done it thousands of times—but the comfort, cleanliness and happiness which the horse manifestly shows when its tail is thorough cleaned makes the job worth while.<br><br>
I am sorry to have to oppose my two hon. and gallant Friends whom I congratulate on putting their poor case so well and giving it even the slight weight
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1478</span>
they were able to infuse into it. I hope the Committee will reject the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first point about which I want to remind the Committee is that the hair of a horse's tail grows from the last four inches, and once that is cut off, although there is a little growth from elsewhere, it is not sufficient. My next point is that the various societies have put forward their fears on these points. They now cut off horses' tails and they are afraid of what will happen if they are not allowed to do it. I speak from the point of view of those who do not cut off horses' tails and we know that no harm results. We talk about facts; the other side talk about fears. I back the facts. I have never cut off a horse's tail and if I have bred one foal I have bred 200. I do not have any trouble on my farms, and I was staggered when I heard about the sore tail because I have never seen one and I do not know that the people who put it forward have seen any. However, they have not had a long-tailed horse, so they cannot know what happens to it.<br><br>
With regard to injuring the horse trade, I say the farmer is not such a fool as that. If he wants a horse he will have a horse; if he wants a tractor he will have one, and the length of a horse's tail will not make any difference. If he wants a horse to hoe his roots instead of a tractor, he will have a horse. As to the point about dirty tails, tie up the horse's tail, thin his tail. Somebody said a horse does not like his tail being pulled. With great respect, that is absolute rot. Cavalrymen well know that all their horses have their tails pulled. We do not want a horse's tail to sweep the ground, so it is thinned judiciously and, if we do not want to plait it, we tie it in a knot. For the reasons I have given I oppose the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are we to have any word from the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture? I understand that the National Farmers' Union have written to the Ministry on this subject, and in the first paragraph of their letter they have definitely expressed the concern which they feel about this. They have sent another letter to three hon. Members who, unfortunately, are not members of this Committee. In that letter they say:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0769">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1479</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"We are much concerned with the proposals contained in the Bill. Our members feel very strongly that there should be other exceptions to the Bill. As we see it the great risk in the case of an undocked horse is that he will get the rein or plough line under his tail. I have no doubt that you are well aware that the effect of this on a horse is sometimes to scare him and make him bolt, and that if the rein is caught at the top of the tail beneath the dock it is no easy matter to free it. In our view insufficient attention has so far been paid to this danger in discussions on the Bill."</p></blockquote>
The Ministry know the views of the N.F.U., and certainly the Parliamentary Secretary to the Home Office heard the farmers say that they had experience of the things which the promoter of this Bill doubts. I believe the Amendment is in the interests of the Ministry of Agriculture, and I hope we shall get some support from them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture (Mr. George Brown)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that in rising I shall meet the request of the hon. and gallant Member. Honestly I do not think, having thought this over carefully and having talked to people about it, that I can give the Committee any guidance on agricultural grounds. The letter from the National Farmers' Union, mentioned by the hon. and gallant Member, referred to other exceptions from the Bill, and if the Amendment were accepted we should have to consider asking for a different definition of a heavy horse. It does not seem to me that this can be limited to pedigree horses. If there is any truth in the point that the farmer is incommoded, it is as true of the ordinary farmer as of the rich fellow who breeds pedigrees. On that point I was in agreement with the expression of view in the letter. On the general argument about the effect this has on the farm worker, we all know of breeds that are not normally docked. The hon. and gallant Member will correct me if I am wrong, but my impression is that Suffolks are seldom if ever docked, and are worked in an undocked state. Certain is it that large numbers of farm horses are not docked.<br><br>
In general our view is that, if horses are used with their tails undocked, there is additional inconvenience to the farmers working them. I would not deny that or understate it. However, we do not think that this Amendment would have any effect on the desire of the Ministry about the breeding of horses and their maintenance on some part of our farm
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1480</span>
economy. There is an agricultural argument, but I think it can be overstated. The best thing I can say to the Committee is that they must weigh the admitted, but not unduly heavy, agricultural argument of inconvenience to the farmer, against whatever weight they feel inclined to give to the purely humanitarian aspect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If this Amendment were not pressed and an Amendment drafted which included not merely the pedigree horses but also the crossbred and the non-pedigree, am I to understand that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary would then be prepared to look more kindly at it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. If that were done it would remove one objection to this Amendment, but my general position remains, and the hon. and gallant Gentleman will not have difficulty in finding what is my own personal feeling from the words I have used.</span></p>

<p>(1) No docked horse coming from a place outside the United Kingdom shall be landed from a ship or aircraft unless the landing is permitted by an officer of Customs and Excise or licensed by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.
<ol>
<li>An officer of Customs and Excise shall not grant any such permission as aforesaid unless he is satisfied that the horse will be exported from Great Britain as soon as practicable; and the said Minister shall not grant any such licence as aforesaid unless he is satisfied on the representation of the person applying for the licence or otherwise that it is intended that the horse shall be used for breeding purposes.</li>
<li>Any person who—
<ol>
<li>lands a horse, or causes or permits a horse to be landed, in contravention of subsection (1) of this section; or</li>
<li>for the purposes of obtaining any such permission of an officer of Customs and Excise as aforesaid makes any statement that he knows to be false in a material particular or recklessly makes any statement that is false in a material particular;</li></ol>
shall be liable on summary conviction to a customs penalty not exceeding twenty-five pounds or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both such a penalty and such imprisonment.</li>
<li>Any person who for the purposes of obtaining any such licence of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries as aforesaid makes any statement that he knows to be false in a material particular or recklessly makes any statement that is false in a material particular shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</li>
<li>This section shall come into operation on the first day of January, nineteen hundred and fifty-five.—[<i>Sir D. White</i>.]</li></ol></p>
<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br><br>
Subsection (2) explains that an officer of Customs and Excise shall not grant any such permission unless he is satisfied that the horse will be exported from Great Britain as soon as practicable. That seems a reasonable way of helping our export trade. Sometimes a horse is brought here from elsewhere and then is moved on. The subsection goes on that the Minister shall not grant any such licence unless he is satisfied that on the representation of the person applying for the licence or otherwise that it is intended
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1482</span>
that the horse shall be used for breeding purposes. One of the objections to the original Bill which was brought to my notice was that it was impossible to import a hackney or a percheron horse from other lands to improve the breed. This subsection was drafted to meet the objections of the Hackney Horse Society and the Percheron Horse Society. From time to time fresh blood is desirable. By all means let us have it, and it can be had if the importer can satisfy the Ministry of Agriculture that all is in order. He will then get the licence and be able to land the horse.<br><br>
Subsection (3) deals with penalties, etc., and Subsection (4) the making of false statements. Then the whole of this new Clause will not come into operation until 1955, so that those who already have docked horses across the water shall be able to bring them in in the meantime without any restriction at all. There are very valuable percheron horses and hackney horses which are already docked across the water and we do not wish to restrict the importation by licence until a reasonable period has elapsed. The date mentioned, 1st January, 1955, was thought to be a reasonable time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier Prior-Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want only an explanation as to Subsection (1). Surely, as the law stands, no horse can be landed in this country without inspection by an Excise officer? Is not this subsection, therefore, redundant?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the position is that if the landing is permitted by an officer of Customs and Excise, it is not a matter of inspection. I think the hon. and gallant Gentleman said that horses would have to be inspected, but it simply says here that no docked horse coming from a place outside the United Kingdom shall be landed from a ship or aircraft unless the landing is permitted by an officer of Customs and Excise or licensed by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. I do not think the question of inspection comes up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Younger)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help. I think it possible that the hon. and gallant Gentleman is confusing the present system whereby horses are landed without a certificate of health. Although they have not got a certificate they are nevertheless landed and inquiries are made subsequently. That procedure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0771">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1483</span>
would give rise to difficulties with regard to the disposal of horses. This is quite a different question from the health question. It did not seem applicable in this instance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Legge-Bourke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had thought of putting down an Amendment, but this Clause goes further, and I think the pedigree societies welcome it. I know it will be greatly welcomed by the Percheron Society because the percheron originates from Northern France and it is important that we should keep in touch with the French breeders as well as our own. I, therefore, commend the Clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the decision that the Committee has already reached, ought not the words "and nicking" to be inserted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a point. I do not think people nick carthorses. Percheron horses come from overseas and I cannot quite imagine any nicked horses coming in. I wanted to keep the thing as simple as possible. If great pressure were brought to bear upon me it might then be expedient to meet the point, but I do not think this is necessary. I take it that hon. Members earlier in the proceedings meant that no one should nick a horse in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Younger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might add one word here in support of what the hon. Gentleman has said. When the earlier events occurred I did consider whether, on behalf of the Government, we ought to have proposed that nicking should be introduced into the new Clause, but the difficulty is that our advice is that it would be quite impossible for the officials of the ports to recognise a nicked horse. That has been gone into with some care, and our information is that even a veterinary surgeon would probably find it difficult to recognise a nicked horse. So even supposing that for the purposes of the importation Clause the word "nicking" was left in, it would be a dead letter from the start. It is doubtful whether we ought to put in something which would be a dead letter. At first sight it may seem rather illogical to make nicking an offence in Clause 1 and not to make it an offence at a later stage;
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1484</span>
but I do not think that is so. I think it is sense to make nicking or anything connected with it an offence so far as you can enforce it, but not to go into a field where enforcement is not possible.</span></p>
<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause read a Second time, and added to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir D. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The next proposed new Clause standing in my name is headed "Restriction on exhibiting docked horses." On further consideration and advice I desire not to move it. I think it would be very difficult of application, and it would make the Bill simpler if it were not included.</span></p>
