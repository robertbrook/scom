	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>INDIRECT TAXATION</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. Despite promises made to the permanent members of the Committee about the frequency of meetings—we were told that we would meet on a fortnightly basis—we appear to be meeting twice weekly. In those circumstances, it is important and urgent for permanent members of the Committee to be given specialist advisers to assist in our work on this European Standing Committee A.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. Surely a Monday afternoon is not the most convenient time for a European Standing Committee to meet? Will you, Mr. Hill, make representations about the timing of our meetings? If we are not to meet on Wednesday mornings, which is our normal practice, members should be asked to agree a more suitable alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me. The Committee needs only a quorum of three and there is a good quorum here today. We must make progress, but I shall make sure that members' views are made known to the Chairman of Ways and Means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mrs. Gillian Shephard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Today's debate has, by any standards, a very wide remit. The Committee is considering, at the recommendation of the Select Committee on European Legislation, the conclusions of the Economic and Finance Council on 24 June on indirect tax, as reported in a written answer on 25 June by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and detailed in a supplementary explanatory memorandum submitted by Customs and Excise on 15 July. It is also considering the further supplementary explanatory memorandum on the technical proposals for the VAT régime to operate after 1992, submitted on 15 October and 25 November, and the supplementary explanatory memoranda on the proposed administrative co-operation arrangements and on the draft directive on the movement and control of excise goods, both of which were submitted on 12 November. Finally, in the light of the agreement reached at the last ECOFIN on 11 November which, like that in June, is subject to parly scrutiny, this debate offers an opportunity to touch on that agreement in the context of the proposals detailed in the relevant explanatory memoranda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be as brief as I can in my opening remarks but, given the complexity of the subject, I need to set the scene. I welcome the opportunity to debate the breadth of indirect taxation issues associated with the completion of the single market, and clearly this debate is a particularly valuable exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
The June ECOFIN marked something of a watershed in the long and undoubtedly complex negotiations on indirect taxation matters in the context of completion of the single market. The agreement reached then, subject of course to parliamentary scrutiny, was a significant step forward and the culmination of intensive discussions during the Luxembourg presidency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recognising the imperative that the objective of a single market should be achieved and the benefits of it realised, the Government accepted that a compromise deal at the June ECOFTN was essential. Thus we were prepared to accept the underpinning floor for excise rates—which will not require the United Kingdom to change any of its current tax rates—to meet the concerns of other member states, but for VAT we were prepared to subscribe to a political agreement to apply a minimum standard rate while remaining firm in our view that market forces, not harmonisation, should be, and are, the real spur to the creation of a true single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A vital corner-stone of the agreement on VAT was the recognition—first made as long ago as November 1989, but inherently confirmed at the June ECOFIN—that the destination principle should be retained; that is, that goods should continue to move zero-rated, with VAT payable in the member state of destination at the rate applicable there. Any move to the origin system must be on the basis of unanimity, and the transitional arrangements will continue automatically in the absence of an agreement. The Government have identified a number of conditions which they consider must be met before any such move can take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essential features of the rates agreement on VAT include a political agreement to apply a minimum standard rate of 15 per cent. from 1 January 1993. The Government considered that such a political declaration was acceptable in the context of an overall agreement but, unlike other member states, do not consider it necessary to translate this declaration into a directive. Of particular importance for the United Kingdom, the agreement also provides for the continued protection of all our existing zero rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On excise, agreement was reached on specific minimum rates for leaded and unleaded petrol, derv, heavy fuel oil, beer and cigarettes; these would subsequently be reflected in a directive. None of those minimum rates requires any change to existing United Kingdom rates of excise duty. The Government felt able to accept the proposed level of the minimum rates on the express condition that rules would be established to distinguish between commercial and private cross-border transactions in alcohol and tobacco products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No agreement was reached on a minimum rate for spirits since the Chancellor could not accept a situation wherein, with a nil rate proposed for wine, the proposed rate for spirits would have worsened the current discrimination against, for example, Scotch whisky exports to the southern member states. The Commission is currently conducting a study into possible distortions between spirits and other alcoholic drinks in the drinks sector, and the minimum rate for spirits will be decided on the basis of that study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft directive on the movement and control of excise goods includes provision for minimum indicative limits for alcohol and tobacco products. The United Kingdom has always been determined to secure the lowest possible indicative limits to provide the maximum
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
protection for our health and social policies, to minimise any revenue loss, and to protect the legitimate trader from unfair competition. The levels of some of the limits proposed in the latest draft are higher than the United Kingdom would wish, and in negotiations we are seeking lower limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other respects, the draft directive now satisifies the majority of United Kingdom concerns, and includes a parallel provision to that in the VAT technical directive for the continuation of duty-free shopping for intra-Community travellers for a transitional period after 1992. This part of the November ECOFIN agreement for the continuation of tax-free shopping by intra-Community travellers until 30 June 1999 was especially welcome. Given the importance of this particular sector to the EC—and United Kingdom—economy, abolition on 1 January 1993 would have presented a range of serious problems, and we regard the transitional period secured, amounting to almost eight years from now, as reasonable in allowing those affected businesses sufficient time to adjust. The agreement reached has been generally welcomed by the interests involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere, the proposals lay down the detailed technical arrangements for the operation of the intra-Community VAT system after 1992, including such aspects as the rules for acquisition, the scope and de minimis thresholds for application of the special schemes and the requirement for aggregate sales listings. Overall, those reflect, as far as has proved possible to achieve in negotiations, the United Kingdom's priorities of simplification and, in particular, the need to minimise burdens on business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The administrative co-operation regulation provides for enhanced administrative co-operation between the fiscal authorities of member states in support of the new VAT regime. The revised formulation as detailed in the supplementary explanatory memorandum submitted on 12 November 1991 is that which was agreed at the November ECOFIN. It includes adequate provision for the protection of professional and commercial secrets and is a welcome measure to assist in combating fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with one observation. The agreements and proposals that we are considering today represent crucial steps towards the effective abolition of fiscal frontiers after 1993 and, as such, are vital to the creation of a true single market. Amidst all the technical detail, and the shades of interpretation that can be put on some of it, it is important that we do not lose sight of the value to United Kingdom business and to the country as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We move now to our question time. I should be obliged if we could have one question at a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that European Standing Committee B is meeting too often is a result of Government action, because the Select Committee on European Legislation recommended that this subject be debated on the Floor of the House. Would the Government have had too many problems from Conservative Members had the matter been debated on the Floor of the House?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why have the Government agreed to zero per cent. on wine, because that allows a high duty to be placed on spirits such as whisky? It could make whisky, which is one of our exports, uncompetitive in many member states of the European Community. I do not understand and nor does
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
the country, why the Minister has acceded to the zero rate on wine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Bottomley—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the Minister want to reply to each individual question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shall we take a group, Mr. Hill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps a group would be better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be useful to acknowledge that alcohol should be taxed on its alcohol content, not on whether the alcohol is a spirit, because the United Kingdom is the major producer of spirits. We should not accept for ever that wine should not carry excise duty, just because other countries, such as France, consider wine something other than alcohol. What prospect is there of establishing a movement in other European countries which would provide a level playing field and get the drink-drive deaths down to the level in this country? At present other European countries have three or four times as many such deaths because wine is not considered alcoholic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. We appear to have adopted a system this afternoon in which members of the Committee ask their questions in succession and the Minister replies to all of them at the end of question time. That makes it difficult for us to obtain clear, thorough and comprehensive answers, which it is the Committee's duty to obtain on behalf of the House. The system is an innovation. May I, with great respect to you, Mr. Hill, express the hope that you will not consider that it should be a precedent for the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's hearing cannot have picked up the remarks between the Minister and myself. She will reply after every three or four questions. In that way, we shall get all the questions in within the hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. Why should we depart from the usual practice in this Committee and in the House at Question Time on this occasion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Favell. That was not a point of order, but the expression of an opinion. I have made the ruling following an arrangement with the Minister that she will reply after every three or four questions. If we take one question a time, we shall not be able to cover all questions because members of the Committee are showing such interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill. We have had many sittings of this Committee in which numerous hon. Members wished to ask questions. We have always managed to accommodate them with the Minister answering in the way the Ministers answer on the Floor of the House. I thought that this hour replicated what happens in the Chamber. Why are we changing the rules?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we should vote on it. Or the Minister could make her own ruling. How would the Minister like to reply to questions? Three at a time or one at a time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever the Committee wishes is what the Committee should have. I am in your hands, Mr. Hill. You will recall that, after the first question, you immediately called a second question. I thought that the procedure might have changed since my previous appearance in the Committee. It seems that it has not. As it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
is clearly making hon. Members uncomfortable, and possibly eating into their question time, perhaps after I have answered the three questions that have been put, I ought to answer questions one at a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I try again? My question relates to paragraph 26 of an unnumbered page—perhaps Departments could do something about that—which refers to
	<br><q><p>"the damaging implications for United Kingdom spirits exports, such as Scotch whisky."</p></q>
I remind the hon. Lady that the Scottish whisky industry employs more than 16,000 people directly and many more thousands indirectly. Would the Government use the veto if Ministers perceived that the proposals would seriously damage the interests of this important Scottish industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the first three questions in the order in which they were asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) asked why the debate was not taking place on the Floor of the House. That is a matter for the business managers. I should be prepared to have the debate wherever it was called and it was called here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why a zero rate on wine had been agreed. That is a provisional rate: the Commission is undertaking a study of distortion effects of excise duties on alcoholic drinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) asked why the European Community was not moving towards taxing drinks on their alcoholic content—he was the first member of the Committee to mention the term level playing field, a phrase that I shall use many times this afternoon. It is extraordinarily difficult to move forward on that basis, fair though it might be, and it is not necessarily in the interests of all sectors of the drinks industry in this country. There is considerable resistance to it in other member states, some of whom depend heavily on the production of alcoholic drinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) and for Wrexham raised the matter of whisky, and I shall state the position. The 24 June ECOFTN agreed low and zero minimum rates for beer and for still and sparkling wine respectively, the latter provisionally pending a Commission report on the control implications of a zero rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer refused to agree to the Commission's proposed minimum rate for spirits because it would have forced four member states to raise their spirits rate while requiring no change in the wine rate, thus widening unacceptably the differential that already exists between the taxes on wine and beer and on whisky. It would have damaged United Kingdom exports; scotch whisky is the fifth most important export and accounted for £1.7 billion of sales last year. As the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow said, it employs 16,000 people in Scotland, many in areas where they might not otherwise easily find employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recognition of those important factors and of the importance of scotch whisky as a symbol of excellence and an export of quality, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor would not accept that minimum rate because it was unfair to spirits. He gained agreement to a Commission study into the possible distortions of competition in the drinks market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Customs and Excise and the industry worked together on posing questions to be answered in the course of the study. Those questions concentrated quite heavily on distortion: unfair competition and the lack of a level playing field that this system of taxation would perpetuate between beer and wine on the one hand and whisky on the other. That study is now taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend is aware of the need for a strong negotiating effort in Brussels to protect the spirits industry's interests. I cannot forecast what stance he will take when the study is completed and new proposals are made. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister visited a distillery this summer, with great pleasure I am sure, and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has had recent meetings with the industry. I also visited a distillery with great pleasure in September and have had frequent meetings with the industry. I hope that that reassures hon. Members that the Government take the matter very seriously. Obviously, I cannot forecast my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's reaction to the outcome of the study, but the seriousness of the matter is well understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The motion asks the Committee to welcome
	<br><q><p>"the significant progress…toward the abolition of fiscal frontiers".</p></q>
Will my hon. Friend assure me that that does not mean that the Treasury are in favour of a common fiscal policy? Will she say precisely what "fiscal frontiers" include and do not include?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The abolition of fiscal frontiers means progress towards a single market, with all the advantages that that provides for our trade and industry. My hon. Friend heard the discussion on scotch whisky and the need to ensure that, as we progress towards a single market, fiscal frontiers do not work to the disadvantage of our own industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked whether the Treasury had abandoned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Treasury now favour a common fiscal policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I made it clear in my opening remarks that the Government felt able to accept minimum duty rates on excise because they involved no change to our excise duties, and because the minima had been set at such a low level that it was inconceivable that any Government would need to change them. However, the Government were not prepared to accept a binding directive on the minimum level of VAT, and instead chose to accept a politically binding level so that the hands of any future Chancellor would not be tied. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wareing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister be good enough to clarify the situation on zero rating? She mentioned a transition period of eight years. Is that an established eight years? How long is zero rating likely to remain? Is there any restriction on the number of years? Can zero rating now be altered by one Chancellor of the Exchequer and be reverted to by another Chancellor? If zero rating were to go on, say, books, could another Government restore zero rating under the present rules?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do any of these documents contain restrictions? I must confess that I find it difficult to go through these documents in the limited time available. Are there any restrictions on the types of goods and services that may be zero rated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Lastly—this is very important—as the Government, or so we are told, are now at the heart of Europe as opposed to where they were in their previous incarnation, are they putting pressure on our partners to realise the usefulness of a zero-rating system, especially for food, fuel and children's clothing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government remain committed to the permanent retention of our ability to apply zero rates. I have every sympathy for the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing), who has a multiplicity of documents to plough through. However, they contain a list of those commodities and other items which attract reduced rating in the Community as a whole. I will send the hon. Gentleman a copy of that list if it would help him, but I assure him that he will find it among the documents. Throughout the negotiations, the Government have made it clear we regard our ability to retain our zero rates as the most important bargaining counter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned a period during which zero rates would be retained. A transitional period will take us up to 1996–97, and we have gained agreement that our zero rates will be retained until then, with no prejudice as to their continuation after that date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it my hon. Friend the Minister's hope that we are likely to achieve ECOFIN's target for going over to an origin-based VAT system by 1 January 1997? Is that a fair assumption on which business can build for the future? One of the United Kingdom's particular difficulties in achieving that has been the need to agree on an appropriate clearance system to be brought into operation then. Will my hon. Friend describe the problems that the Government have encountered so far with the Commission's proposal for a clearance system? That point is not explained in the documents that hon. Members have received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there were many problems with a move to an origin system. For example, the proposed clearing-house arrangement was regarded with horror by our business organisations, notably the Institute of Directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because they felt that it would be confusing, difficult and immensely bureaucratic to re-apply the tax at the rates obtaining in the different member states. Therefore, we are not unhappy with what we have achieved with the destination system, which is simple and builds on what we already have. There are some problems, but the move to the origin system will require unanimous agreement. The Government have said that we will agree only if it is clear that benefits will accrue from a move to an origin system after the 1996–97 transitional period. Our conditions for agreeing to such a move are that it must reduce business costs, that it must protect our zero rates and that it must be revenue neutral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have to see how the destination system operates in the meantime. However, it is clear that that breathing space will give United Kingdom business a chance to see how the new system works. It will also enable the Commission to see whether an arrangement that was more sensible and less cumbersome than the proposed clearinghouse system might have been devised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that, to avoid fiscal frontiers and distortion, one needs to set maximum as well as minimum levels? If the Government agree with that, how will any maximum level affect the car tax, for example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question has a nasty little sting in the tail. I assume that the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) is referring to the special car tax which is the vestige of purchase tax. That tax is acceptable, as it does not come within either VAT or excise systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for maximum levels, the Government have always believed that market forces exert downward pressure on both VAT and excise taxes. Interestingly, that has happened with VAT rates across the Community. As we move closer to the single market, there has been a striking convergence of standard VAT rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I move to the subject of the indicative limits of goods brought into the country for personal use? Is it true that the present limit for beer suggested by the presidency is 150 litres? Does my hon. Friend the Minister not agree that if the limit is that high or is likely to increase, it will damage the British brewing industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, in addition to 150 litres of beer, the presidency is advocating that 90 litres of still wine, 90 litres of sparkling wine and 10 litres of spirits can be brought into the country. If that were to be the personal allowance for one trip, it would, exceed the 21 measures of alcohol for males and 14 measures for females that have been recommended as a reasonable weekly amount. It is also ludicrous for the limit to be so high, given that the total weight of products that could be brought back by four people would exceed a tonne, which is well in excess of what the normal family saloon car can hold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Stevens) has been reading the tabloids today. He will have read that not only family saloon axles but coach axles groaned under the loads that they were expected to hold when people on all-time shopping sprees brought in huge amounts of beer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Minimum indicative levels are designed to distinguish between commercial transactions and those in which goods are brought for personal consumption. The tabloid press this morning cast doubt on how people regard personal consumption before the minimum indicative levels come into play. At present, there is only a draft for minimum indicative levels, and we feel that those are too high. The suggested levels are 800 cigarettes and, as my hon. Friend said, 10 litres of spirits and 150 litres of beer. We believe that those levels are too high, but we have always felt that there should be either duty rates which are effective or some other limit which distinguishes clearly between commercial and personal transactions. These matters are still being discussed; no final decision has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister to return to harmonisation, as I should like clarification of the Government's thinking? If the survey that she said has been undertaken to bring about harmonisation proves or suggests that a tax-induced element is working against spirits, particularly Scotch whisky, and if the Government cannot reach an agreement on how low that level of taxation should be, will they argue for some kind of capping mechanism so that the differentials between countries will not further harm the exports of Scotch whisky?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not ruling out that option at this stage, but we must consider what will be negotiable and achievable in the light of the study when it is produced, We accept that a capping option would benefit an important export industry, but we have been opposed to maximum rates, as I said to the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley). In practice, capping would mean maximum rates for those member states which cannot contemplate a tax on wine. Beyond any harmonisation necessary for the introduction of the single market, member states should be free to fix whatever duties suit their circumstances, but they and the Commission would register an interest if these duties resulted in a distortion of the single market and fair competition. The purpose of the study is to determine whether the duties set have resulted in a distortion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am hedging my answer because we are waiting for the results of the study.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where does the concept of duty free fit with the concept of fiscal harmonisation? When my hon, Friend strides through Heathrow as a Cabinet Minister in the year 2000, will she be carrying her little bag of duty free goods from Schiphol airport?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I leave unanswered one of my hon. Friend's questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the November ECOFIN, it was agreed, subject to scrutiny, that tax-free and duty-free shopping would continue until 1 July 1999. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer won that important concession. The United Kingdom has four of the six principal duty-free outlets in the European Community, so that breathing space was important to the interests of our industry and national economy. Nevertheless, once frontiers within the Community fall, duty free should fall also. Balancing the concept of the single market with the needs of our industry, which required time to adapt, necessitated much lobbying. Few member states were sympathetic, which makes my right hon, Friend's achievement in securing the sensible transition period all the more welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister seen the document entitled "Competition between Alcoholic Drinks: An Analysis", which was commissioned by the Scotch Whisky Association and the Gin and Vodka Association? If she has, what is her view of the contention that price competition exists between different categories of alcoholic drinks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read the study, but may I ask the hon. Gentleman to clarify his question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People can drink wine, beer or spirits. They have a choice and the cost of those drinks is a factor in their choice. High tax on one product and low tax on another could result in unfair competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for clarifying his question. High tax can distort competition, but the Government have always believed that the level of VAT or excise is a matter for an individual Government. The Chancellor of the Exchequer receives substantial revenue from excise duties. He has to balance the revenue needed with the requirements of an industry. In the single market, we are concerned with distortion between member states. Individual taxation is a matter for the individual state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare my interest as parliamentary adviser to the Scotch Whisky Association, which will appreciate the sympathy of my hon. Friend the Minister to the industry's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is by far the largest spirit producer in the Community. Most of our partners produce beers and wines. Therefore, if the case for spirits is not made by the United Kingdom, it will not be made. If we do not support our substantial scotch whisky industry, it will be endangered. That is not special pleading because the industry accounts for a large part of the country's economy; the same applies to the gin industry. The Government must put the case for the spirits industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that and hope I have made our position clear. My hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) said that he understood that the Government took the matter seriously. I can confidently say that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will continue to press for the best and fairest deal for our important spirits industry. I was pleased to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst say that we are an important producer of gin, because that should not be forgotten. In this Room there are more whisky devotees than gin devotees, but who can tell?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are the biggest spirits producer in the EC and we must stand up for that important industry in the same way as other countries stand up for their wine and beer industries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Minister's attention to the article on the flat-rate scheme for farmers? I understand that that entails a compensation scheme and a refund scheme but that member states will determine the method by which refunds are made. Does the hon. Lady accept that the determination of a scheme for refunds, and particularly its timing, can make a significant difference to the cash flows of farmers? Is she satisfied that there is no room for distortion, or for back-door methods to come into play?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be rash to say that I was always absolutely convinced that there was no possibility for backdoor methods to come into play. The hon. Gentleman perhaps knows that officials are working with the bloodstock industry on what scheme can be devised to help the industry, which may prove to help more general farmers. However, the details of the scheme are not yet complete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in thinking that, even if the Commission thought that a rate of duty or VAT in this country were a fiscal barrier, we retain our right of veto. May I have an assurance from my hon. Friend that if we sign the Dutch economic and monetary union treaty we will retain that veto?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say to the Minister—I am sure that I speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey)—that we were pleased to receive her assurances on the need to protect the interests of the many thousands of people who are employed directly and indirectly by the whisky industry in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 11(b) of the supplementary explanatory memorandum entitled "Reduced rates" states:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
	<br><q><p>"Broadly speaking, this list comprises essential products, and also goods and services corresponding to social or cultural policy objectives".</p></q>
In the light of what appears to be the concession of a super reduced rate for "certain Spanish goods"—to quote the Minister's words—will the Minister defend the needs of authors, publishers and others who are concerned with the creation and publication of books, magazines, weeklies, monthlies and so on? Surely they need the same defence as the Minister is offering the scotch whisky industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate that it has been an absolute sticking point on the Government's part that we should retain the ability to keep our zero rates on items that are currently zero-rated. We wish to retain our ability to impose zero rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend comment on the agreement that small brewers that produce fewer than 200,000 hectolitres will receive preferential tax treatment? Does my hon. Friend realise that such preferential treatment will apply to about 90 per cent. of German breweries? The position could be very different for United Kingdom breweries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I realise that. We are watching carefully the arrangements for small brewers and for small distilleries. Much depends on the exact definition of a small brewery and, indeed, a small distillery. In this country, there is much disagreement among large breweries about the proposed arrangements for small breweries. We want a level playing field across the drinks industry. I am not entirely convinced that the arrangements for small breweries achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall the decision of the European Court of Justice in 1983 against the United Kingdom Government when it was ruled that we could not discriminate against wine in our duty regime compared with beer, because they were competing products. Is not there a clear contradiction between that European Court of Justice decision and the ECOFIN decision in June this year, which is referred to in the papers, to establish a positive minimum duty rate for beer but a zero rate for wine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that that is precisely why there is a further study of the provisional zero rate agreed for wine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When ECOFIN meets again and such issues arise, will it be possible to explain to the other European Ministers of Finance the difference between the circumstances applying to scotch and those applying to beer? As the United Kingdom is the production point for whisky, it is in the European Community's interests to have a taxation regime that might be copied by countries outside the European Community so that the European export can grow rather than be discriminated against as, I am sad to say, it is discriminated against in some European countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could my hon Friend explain to other Ministers the distinction between those circumstances, in which all scotch is likely to come from Scotland, and those applying to beer, which is produced in each European Community country, and on which a difference of duty of 1·1p per pint in France, compared with 29p per pint in the United Kingdom, let alone VAT, leads to a differential in taxation of more than 25 times? That produces all kinds of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
distortions and cannot be regarded as a suitable market for taxation which otherwise can be relied on to bring the tax rates more into line with each other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: ECOFIN will meet tomorrow, but I understand that those matters will not be discussed then, for fairly obvious reasons. I believe that the next relevant meeting of ECOFIN will be on 16 December, when those matters will be discussed again. I shall certainly refer my hon. Friend's remarks, which are as apposite as ever, to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who may wish to take them into account when he makes representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Goodman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the question asked by the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley), I refer the Minister to paragraph 14(iv) of her document, which states:
	<br><q><p>"Legislative changes to primary and secondary legislation will be necessary before 1993 to give effect to the rules for distinguishing commercial from private cross-border transactions in alcohol and tobacco".</p></q>
If the Minister is unable to defend the interests of the Scotch whisky industry in the way that we outlined, would it be possible, after the enactment of EC legislation, for representatives of that industry to seek an injunction from the European Court of Justice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that question is that I do not know. Once the measures under discussion have been agreed to by Parliament, we shall present draft clauses to industry and to the trade. As far as the Scotch whisky industry is concerned, we would not be able to do that if there has been no agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know about injunctions. I suppose that the legal position might be laid out for the hon. Gentleman. I could write to him if he found that helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question was prompted by my growing realisation that the structure and functions of the European Court of Justice make it a supreme court for English and Scottish legal systems and for the other 11 legal systems, and it also seems to be taking on the role of an appeal court. Its role as a supreme court and as a court of appeal will develop over the next few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister may not want to answer my question directly as that may be for the authorities of the House. Although many questions have been asked about excise duties in this country and in other member states, three or four issues in the document, which the Minister presented clearly, have not been covered fully. We could easily have spent two and a half hours on the VAT change between destination and origin, on the different rates and likelihood of convergence, or the ability to prevent undesirable convergence, and on the excise duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should congratulate the Minister on her handling of much of the content of the document, but the procedure has not been very satisfactory. It would have been useful to be able to use some part of the special procedure for legislation, which is seldom used, or the Select Committee procedure, to question officials on technical issues and to put pressure on ministerial colleagues and encourage them to pursue what is in the interest of the United Kingdom and the European Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have been delighted had officials responsible for the day-to-day administration of these matters been able to answer questions in my stead this afternoon. However, my fairly limited experience of the House is that we could discuss anything for any length of time without any limitation. But I accept the serious point made by my hon. Friend the Member of Eltham because he and other hon. Members realise that many of the issues are intertwined. Unfinished business was left over after every one of the ECOFIN meetings. It would have been deeply unsatisfying for this committee to have discussed something that was in the air and subject to 100 per cent. alteration before the the next meeting of ECOFIN. That is the problem. It must have been for that reason that the Scrutiny Committee decided to bring together all the documents at this one meeting. I accept that the issues are complex and lengthy. Many of them are also most important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We spoke about fiscal harmonisation. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to think carefully before the Treasury accepts that concept. It has become clear during our deliberations that different rates of excise duties on different types of alcoholic drinks could work against the British interest. That could be very damaging to the Scotch whisky industry, for example. To accept that, just because everything is the same throughout Europe, could be very bad for British industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate, in the vague hope of reassuring my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, that the Government accepted minima for excise, which have not obliged this country to change any of its excise duties, but we were not willing to accept binding minima on VAT. A political agreement has been stuck that will not tie the hands of a future Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scrutiny Committee, of which I am a member, recommended that these matters be considered by the House. The Scrutiny Committee did not stipulate that these matters should be brought to European Standing Committee B. On the Floor of the House, we might have been given only 90 minutes for discussion, as was the lamentable case last Wednesday when we debated the European Community draft budget of £45 billion. The few Back Benchers present had to share 30 minutes of that 90 minutes of debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are still problems about the scrutiny of these important matters. On the basis of the Minister's experience of this Committee, does she recognise the need for us to have specialist advisers on such important matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The things one gets asked! These matters are most complex and the hon. Gentleman's question is for the Scrutiny Committee to answer. It would take a considerable time, which hon. Members do not have, to study the issues. I am sure that the Scrutiny Committee would want to help members of this Committee and other hon. Members to understand these matters, and it will solve that problem in its own way. I am skirting round suggestions for jolly ways in which that might be achieved—teach-ins and so on—because it is a matter for the Scrutiny Committee. I must not be led on by the blandishments of the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, after the meeting on 16 December, the excise duty issue has not yet been resolved, will the hon. Lady's officials meet the various interests involved in the excise duties, which affect the export trade and jobs? It may not be possible to return to European Standing Committee B or to the Floor of the House, but if issues are unresolved, a briefing for the commercial interests would be useful. Many make representations in other European Community countries if there are battles over the levels of excise duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must give a rather bland though true, answer. Customs and Excise officials constantly meet representatives from the industries. I, too, am involved in some of those meetings. There is an enormous amount of to-ing and fro-ing. We greatly value the detailed technical knowledge that industry interests bring to the solution of practical problems. A joint VAT consultative committee regularly considers these issues and we have regular contact with groups such as the Institute of Directors, the Confederation of British Industry and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham that those contacts will continue, and probably increase, as we need to expose draft legislation and to resolve the problems that he mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><q><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Documents No. 6762/89 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by H. M. Customs and Excise on 15th July 1991 relating to completion of the Internal Market and approximation of indirect taxes, 6641/90 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memoranda submitted by H. M. Customs and Excise on 12th November 1990, 17th May 1991, 15th October 1991 and 25th November 1991 relating to the common system of Value Added Tax, 6642/90 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by H. M. Customs and Excise on 12th November 1991 on administrative co-operation in the field of indirect taxation, and 9670/90 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by H. M. Customs and Excise on 12th November 1991 on the general arrangements for the holding, movement and control of products subject to excise duty; and congratulates the Government on negotiating an agreement on indirect tax rates, which in particular safeguards the Government's right to continue its existing zero rates for VAT and an agreement on the VAT technical system which provides for the effective operation of the intra-Community VAT system after 1992, and includes provision for the continuation of intra-Community tax-free shopping for a transitional period, together with an agreement on enhanced administrative co-operation arrangements which will help to combat fraud; supports the proposals on the movement and control of excise goods, which in particular include provision for the continuation of intra-Community duty-free shopping for a transitional period, and for minimum indicative limits to distinguish between commercial and private cross-border transactions in alcohol and tobacco; and welcomes the significant progress which these agreements and proposals represent toward the abolition of fiscal frontiers and the creation of the single market.—[	<i>Mrs. Gillian Shepherd.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As other members of the Committee have said, this is a huge topic. We could easily debate it for six or seven hours and still not cover everything. I do not intend to cover all the topics—there simply is not time to do so. I shall not refer to issues on which I am in general agreement with the Government or issues on which the differences of opinion are minor. I shall also try and be reasonably brief, so that we do not have to stay until 7 o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our parliamentary system means that, by and large, the Government undertake negotiations in private. They do not tell us, by way of scrutiny, until nearly everything has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
been done. That is a pity because, on such matters, there is not much difference in political content. As Members of Parliament, we could have had far more input in a scrutinising capacity than we have. That is not to say that the Minister has not tried to help us in any way that she can, but she is as much a victim of the system as we are. Therefore, I think that the motion, which
	<br><q><p>"congratulates the Government on negotiating and agreement"</p></q>
is a little OTT. However, I shall not recommend that my hon. Friends vote against the motion. We can read and interpret it in the usual parliamentary way, as we do in respect of other Government motions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise five or six topics, and perhaps the Minister will reply to them at the end of the debate. Labour Members believe that some harmonisation is necessary. Until now, the Government's stance has been to reject it, but I detected a slight change in the Minister's remarks that perhaps a certain amount of harmonisation might not go amiss. If the Government have indeed moved from the stance adopted under the previous Prime Minister, that is to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear problem in the bloodstock industry. If there is no harmonisation, much of our bloodstock will be moved to Eire or France. Harmonisation is also necessary regarding excise duties. It cannot be right that, under the guise of importing for personal use, individuals can bring in huge amounts of tobacco goods—800 cigarettes—as well as huge amounts of beer and spirits. Equally, it cannot be right to keep a stringent customs regime at our ports. If the single market means anything, it means that we should be able to move freely without having to undergo customs checks. I recognise the necessity of such checks for drugs, but that is a European Community issue which demands the attention of all member states, not just the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we reject the proposition of keeping a customs check to prevent the large quantities of products suggested in the indicative limits being brought into the country, there must be some harmonisation of excise duties. I am not saying that we can move in that direction immediately, but we should at least begin to do so. It is difficult to believe that the Government agreed to a minimum zero rate on wine, because that will cause problems for the whisky industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) has left. On the other hand, it may be a good thing, because he might have been impelled to make a long speech in response to my comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert N. Wareing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, West Derby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might have forced a Division as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he might have forced a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept that harmonisation needs to be achieved, I hope that the Government will take that point on board because it will make life simpler for all of us. The Minister said that the zero minimum rate on wine is provisional. I hope that that provision can be changed. It is not right that certain countries will have zero rating on alcohol, whereas, in practice, other countries will, have a very high rate on wine, beer and spirits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the proposal that small producers could be exempt from the excise regime between member states. Judging from the documents, the Government are also concerned. It will be difficult to police a regime in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
which wine producers who produce 133,000 bottles a year or fewer are exempt from an intra-Community excise regime. I hope that the Government will consider the matter seriously and ensure that that does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that individual taxation is a matter for the individual state. Countries such as Italy may have a low rate of excise duty on wine—zero, perhaps—and a high rate on spirits. Price competition would disadvantage the Scotch whisky industry. That is why we need harmonisation. It is not being a Euro-fanatic to ask for harmonisation; I want it on purely practical grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have already put this idea to the Government—if he has, I am sorry that I was not paying attention. One way of dealing with very low or zero rates on wine is for the European Community to say that the maximum excise duty on spirits should be a multiple of the rate on wine—for example, 15 times or five times. In countries which had a zero rate on wine there would be no tax on whisky. That would make the producers happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting argument, which I am sure the Minister has heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious problem. The target rates in a previous Commission proposal have now been abandoned and we only have reference rates, which we need to toughen. The Committee is well aware of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) guaranteed that children's clothes, domestic fuel and food would remain zero-rated. Other items should be zero-rated—for example, transport, books and periodicals. Will the Government strengthen the ECOFIN agreement? Admittedly, items that had a zero rating in January will continue to do so. The Commission has reluctantly allowed us to keep those zero rates, but, reading between the lines, it seems to be saying that it will come back to the matter in two or three years and have another go at abolishing zero rates. That sounds ominous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have preferred an agreement in which it was clearly stated that, for items such as food and children's clothes, a zero rate is not only tolerated but that the European Commission will support a member state's decision to apply such a rate to a certain product for social reasons. The impression given is that once zero rates are let go they will not return. Food is a category of goods to which a zero rate could be applied by countries that do not have a zero rate at present. I hope that the Minister will say something about that. I also hope that she will reaffirm the promise by the previous Prime Minister, and that she may be able to add items such as transport, books and periodicals to that promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister had discussions with the cider industry? There have been problems over whether cider was to be regarded as being in competition with beer or with wine. Is the United Kingdom cider industry happy with the proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Duty free goods will continue to be available until 30 June or 1 July 1999, except for passengers on international trains travelling between London and the continent. That seems somewhat unfair. Duty free shops will be sited at the portals on either side of the tunnel, so people will be able to get out and buy duty free goods there. However, they will not be able to do so if they get on at Waterloo and travel to Paris. Would not it ensure fairer competition if duty-free goods were available at, say, Waterloo or the Gare du Nort

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
in Paris, or on the train itself? Rightly or wrongly, airlines are allowed to sell some duty-free goods in the air. It is only fair that the same privilege should be available to SNCF and British Rail. I see that many hon. Members are nodding their agreement, so I hope that the Minister will take that point seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister deal with the exchange of information that is requested to control fraud? The documents show that the system could work, but information has to be made available from one customs authority to another. Moreover, in the attempt to control fraud the revenue authorities in different member states can ask for access to information held by the customs authorities. However, such an exchange of information must be balanced with the requirements of confidentiality. In this country, much industrial and commercial information is held by Customs and Excise, and we must ensure that it is kept confidential. I should be grateful if the Minister will confirm that, under the new system, confidentiality will be maintained and that an adequate exchange of information to help crack down on fraud will be ensured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right to say that, for personal consumption, 800 cigarettes is too many. The documents make it clear that, as well as those 800 cigarettes, one will be able to bring in 400 cigarillos, 200 cigars, 1 kilogramme of smoking tobacco and 0·5 kilogrammes of snuff and chewing tobacco. Also permissible are 10 litres of spirits, 20 litres of intermediate products such as sherry or port, 90 litres of still and sparkling wines and 150 litres of beer. The hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) has already mentioned that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was under the impression—wrongly, perhaps—that chewing tobacco is defined as an illegal substance in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about that. I believe that chewing tobacco is still produced in Scotland, but no doubt the Minister can comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also stated that each limit stands alone and that a traveller can bring in goods in all categories up to those limits. I am not arguing for a strict customs regime at United Kingdom ports of entry to catch tourists who bring in 11 litres of spirit instead of 10 litres—Customs and Excise officers have better things to do—but if a person brought in such a large quantity, surely it would be difficult to believe that it was for personal consumption. The danger is that it could adversely affect our industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a tobacco industry in this country. It would be easy for a person to bring in great quantities of tobacco products, ostensibly for his personal consumption, and then sell them to the corner shop so that they can both make a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has probably seen a submission by Gallaher Limited for the Chancellor's Budget in 1992. Under the heading "Introduction and Summary" it says:
	<br><q><p>"Leaving aside the virtually unquantifiable losses arising from illegal importation"—</p></q>
all members of the Committee will be well aware of that problem—
	<br><q><p>"the levels of which could be substantial, it is estimated that the cost to the United Kingdom Treasury of travellers' duty paid allowances increasing to 800 cigarettes could be in the order of £450 million per annum."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
Of course, Gallaher may have overstated the case—no lobbying organisation would underestimate its case—but even if it is overestimated by 100 per cent., £450 million a year is a lot of money. We could all think of better things to do with such a sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is serious and the Government did not get it right in ECOFIN. I urge them to go about solving the problem sensibly so that when we next have a debate we can congratulate them on their actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) in commenting on indicative limits. I believe that the Government have got it right. We want to avoid persecuting the ordinary traveller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want commercial organisations to be set up to cart large quantities of beer around the Community. I do not agree totally with the commercial companies' line; some differences in wholesale prices are inexcusable and a bit of competition would be useful. Some differences in price may be due to the various characteristics of the drinking market. For example, in this country, people tend to drink in pubs—we are grateful to pubs for providing social centres and controlled drinking—but in many other countries alcohol is mostly drunk in the home. I suspect that that is part of the explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indicative limits for tobacco are rather like duty-free sales of tobacco. I hope that the Council of Ministers will agree to abolish immediately the duty-free limits for tobacco within the Community. There is much to be said for drinking alcohol, but nothing to be said for smoking cigarettes. As someone who has not always been perfect in either respect, I believe that we should tackle the use of tobacco more strongly than we tackle the use of alcohol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be too dismissive of wine production in European countries. Britain has a small wine industry and I hope that we shall be successful in ensuring that continental quality standards do not exclude English wines from being accepted as of the highest quality. However, in France and many other European countries, wine is produced on a local family basis. Customs and Excise should make some concession for casual sales and for small scale operations if excise duty or its equivalent is brought in, for example, in France. When an operation becomes commercial, it is then that we start looking for an approach that allows the market in taxation to begin to work. I do not believe that any Committee wants total harmonisation or to depart from the idea put forward by my right hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson), when he was Chancellor, of getting a market in taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly believe that Parliament should keep an eye on our Ministers, the European Commission and the Economic and Financial Ministers. When I served as a junior Minister in the Department of Transport there was much pressure—I cannot remember whether it came from the European Community or from within the United Kingdom system—to abolish the personal importation of cars. I said that it was important, as long as safety regulations were enforced, to allow people to import cars from other European Community countries because that was one other way to put pressure on manufacturers. We should be aware of such issues. Only by standing up for consumers will we properly do our job of representing citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
There is also a production interest, which has been well represented today. The interests of fisherman have also been well represented on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth remembering that we are still in the evolutionary stage of the European Community. On driving minibuses, it required a campaign involving many groups in this country and in other EC countries to understand that issue. Perhaps we have managed to establish the spirits industry interest from this country which will, of course, be shared by the cognac and armagnac manufacturers in France and by other spirits manufacturers in the Netherlands and elsewhere. However, the dominant spirits exports from the European Community as a whole will come from Scotland, within the United Kingdom. That point has been well made and will be accepted by my hon. Friend the Minister's colleagues on the ECOFIN.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of administrative convenience, administrative co-operation is important. To have a system, as the European Community develops, where we rely on national systems and detailed investigation of what those systems are doing is a negation of the free market abolition of unnecessary frontiers within the European Community. We should listen to advice from Customs and Excise and from other similar Government services to see how we can achieve rough justice. Some people will get away with more than they get away with now, which is no bad thing, in the same way that we can move alcohol from Birmingham to Bristol or from London to Ludlow. That sort of movement should not worry us too much. We want a system that stops us trying to cane a particular part of industry too heavily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has not been about car tax, but that is an issue that we should consider when trying to achieve a level playing field. Such issues require discussion in Committee, in our Parliament and in the European Parliament. There should also be feed-back to enable us to understand other issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should recognise, in terms of alcohol, that body weight and metabolism determine how long it takes alcohol to affect someone. I think that the safe consumption for driving cars is nil. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that we should be allowed to import duty-free what we can carry, and I hope that she will not regard that as unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.54 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill, for giving me the opportunity to speak. I shall be brief and limit my speech to the subject of Scotch whisky. I declare an interest, because I am the cochairman of the all-party Scotch whisky group, along with another admirable stalwart, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), who never misses an opportunity to support the Scotch whisky industry. Our support is such that we co-sponsored a whisky tasting fete on Thursday to enable people to discuss and taste the excellent quality of malt whisky. However, the tasting got slightly out of hand, and perhaps more whisky was consumed than was properly tasted. Nevertheless, the verdict—there was no dissenting voice—was that the quality was excellent. I shall not do a commercial on whose whisky it was; I shall simply say that it was United Distillers and five of its best malts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My interest in the whisky industry is well known, not only because I happen to enjoy the taste of whisky but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
because the industry is very important to Scotland. We have heard the figures; it employs thousands of workers. As the Minister agreed, in some remote areas, if it were not for a whisky distillery, there would be no alternative employment—in fact, no life at all. Much of the life of some of our smaller, rural areas depends greatly on jobs in or around the distilleries. The industry's value is extremely well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the Government. That is worth noting, because it is not often that I pay tribute to the present Government. In March, early-day motion 607 was signed by more than 100 hon. Members who urged the Government to examine the problems that would arise if duty-free shopping were ended. I supported the Government on that matter and the Scotch whisky industry most certainly agreed with their stance. We have successfully managed for it to be phased out over 10 years. To the Scotch whisky industry, that represents approximately £58 million. When that is translated into jobs, it is perhaps well over 1,000 jobs a year. We were pleased with that achievement. The Scotch whisky industry was worried that, perhaps, the Minister or the Chancellor of the Exchequer might have thought that that was a tradeoff between the duty-free business and the business of harmonisation. However, from what the Minister has said today, I am relieved and pleased that that business seems to be disposed of. In reality, we are looking at the business of so-called harmonisation. That is a separate and more vital issue for the United Kingdom, as important as the duty free issue was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom's spirits industry earns more than £660 million for this country; of that, £622 million is earned by the export of Scotch whisky—the figures show its importance. Recently, the Scotch whisky industry managed to increase its part of the market, especially in Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal, which are seeing the most growth and would be most affected if the present proposals resulted in a price rise—purely because of tax changes—of perhaps between £2 and £2·50 per bottle. Such price rises would severely hit an industry which, as I said, may provide the only employment in many rural areas. The Government must argue vociferously in the industry's interests on that matter. They must take notice of the representation of the United Kingdom spirits industry—indeed, they have done so. We are satisfied with the progress so far. I urge the Minister seriously to consider that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government, the Chancellor and the Prime Minister cannot reach a satisfactory agreement on much lower taxation, whatever level they might agree must be backed up by a capping mechanism. It is a question of balance. If we can reduce taxation on whisky to that on wine, perhaps we will not need to worry too much about a capping mechanism. But if it cannot be brought down to a reasonable level, some countries will differentiate against Scotch whisky. That is why we have asked the Chancellor to examine that problem. The Minister said that the Government's mind is not closed to a capping mechanism. However, I know that there is great resistance in Government circles on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been interesting. Thank you, Mr. Hill, for giving me the opportunity to speak, as I am not a member of the Committee. I have heard much of interest in the Committee and I hope that my hon. Friends will tip me off about what is on the agenda for future sittings. Perhaps I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
shall have the opportunity to attend debates more often on some interesting subjects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise three important economic issues that have emerged in the debate and to make two general points. I shall try to be succinct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with much of what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Elthani (Mr. Bottomley) but I go further than he did in his strictures on the subject of duty free. If the European Community is to subsidise consumption of any product, I cannot think of two worse candidates than tobacco and alcohol. Consumption of those two items is subsidised by the duty-free regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Relief of taxation is not a subsidy. Taxation is a way of gaining money for useful purposes and of penalising what Governments think should be penalised. Alcohol is not nearly as bad as tobacco.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All economic behaviour is determined by relativities, as I am sure my hon. Friend will agree. Where a general regime establishes a general price for certain commodities throughout the Community or in one member state, but in certain areas it is agreed that there should be a much lower price, its effect is to subsidise consumption. There is subsidised consumption for those individuals who are fortunate enough to pass frequently through duty-free shops in airports or ports. However, it is an economic subsidy that does not have much economic or moral sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be sceptical when she is subject to high-powered lobbying from the representatives of airports, ports and the duty-free industry. Those who defend a considerable economic privilege fight hard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that we have four of the largest duty-free areas in this country and I recognise that as a national interest. It may not be a coincidence that our airports have been less aggressive and effective in building up a commercial business in the non-duty-free area. Other major airports in the Community such as Frankfurt, Charles de Gaulle and Zurich, have enormous shopping developments outside the duty-free area. Our people have been far less aggressive in exploiting that market because they are so happily living off the effective subsidy of the duty-free regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister is sceptical, too, when she meets the brewers, whose lobbying is also likely to be effective and high powered. I draw her attention to an article on this subject in 	<i>The European</i> of 22 November, with the headline
	<br><q><p>"UK day trippers keep French cash tills ringing."</p></q>
A table in the article sets out relative prices, from which it appears that the cost of Stella Artois beer per litre is about three times higher in the United Kingdom than in France. The brewers have expressed their worries about that to the Minister. No doubt much of that difference in price is due to the differences in excise duty. However, the price of Cambembert is given at two and a half times higher in the United Kingdom that in France. Even the price of a loaf of bread in the United Kingdom is twice what it is in France and there is no excise duty on cheese or bread. VAT is levied on food products in France but not in this country, so perhaps the multiples are even closer to those under the beer heading in the table than would appear from a casual
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
reading of it. The table shows that there is an excise duty differential, which may be an unacceptable handicap for the British brewing industry. It may also show that there is a less than sufficiently competitive market in beer in this country. The relative increases in the price of beer over recent months provide evidence of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister is tough on such issues. I hope that she will not let her colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry be tempted to allow brewers to confuse what may be a handicap that arises from the excise duty regime with an unacceptably competitive position in their sector of industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with something that the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) said. I suppose that it is possible for socialists to have a good idea once in a decade or so. I found it impossible to disagree with his arguments about the provision of duty-free shopping on channel tunnel trains. It would be a blatant market distortion if those who travelled by air from London to Brussels or from London to Paris, or who put their cars on the channel tunnel train or the ferry benefited from the provisions, but those who took the train did not. I hope that the Government will ensure that such a distortion will not occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intellectual powers of my hon. Friend the Minister are necessary to grapple with this complex web of problems, and my hon. Friend has done an extremely good job this afternoon. The essence of the complexity seems to lie in two ironies which struck me forcefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have always set their face against fiscal harmonisation. They have always said that we should leave it to market forces to control the margin of divergence within which member states set indirect rates of taxation, because, if frontiers are removed and a single market is created, there will be market-imposed restraints on Governments. Bureaucratic apparatus to harmonise indirect tax rates and granting to the European Community of competence in that area become unnecessary. That is a fair summary of the Government's position and I have supported it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal on VAT works, because people will not move large distances and incur substantial costs in order to arbitrage between VAT rates that may be 15 per cent. in one country and 17.5 per cent. in a neighbouring country, especially if they have to cross the channel. That means that we shall not be able to increase our VAT rate to 35 per cent., which we would not want to do, and the French would not be able to reduce their rate to 2.5 per cent., which they equally would not want to do. Two broad bands of VAT have been agreed within the Community and market pressures are sufficient to achieve what we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That system breaks down completely when one considers excise duty. No analogy can be drawn between the two situations. The difference between the rates of excise duty on a product in different member states varies not by 10 per cent., 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. but by several hundred percentage points. Indeed, in certain instances where there is a zero rate, such as is the case with wine, they vary literally by infinity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that, in those circumstances, the idea that everything can be left to market forces breaks down? It is a considerable irony that the British Government should urge minima on the Community in this matter. I have some sympathy with the view that we should have the courage of our convictions and recognise that the initial market formula that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
considered adequate in this regard does not work well for excise duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second irony is that the obvious way in which to remove the competitive distortions and handicaps in connection with excise duty faced by British producers of beer and other products would be to lower massively our rates of excise duty. That would be fine, but my hon. Friend the Minister rightly would oppose that solution for two reasons. First, the Government would lose revenue, and neither they nor I would want to have to increase income tax or VAT to compensate for a reduced burden of excise duty on alcoholic drinks or tobacco. Secondly, such a move would have the consequences for health and safety which my hon. Friend the Minister for Eltham has described so eloquently to the Committee. The apparent and fascinating irony is that the British Government are in the lead in saying that the duty-free regime must be protected. However, that regime runs counter to the aims of maximising revenue and optimising health protection, which seem to govern the Government's policy elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are a long way from achieving a coherent and sustainable solution to such complex problems. Moreover, if Parliament is to contribute in any meaningful fashion to the evolution of the Government's thinking on these matters, we need more than the 90 or 150 minutes that we have had this afternoon. Such is the importance, economic and otherwise, of the complex issues to do with indirect taxation, excise duty and VAT, that I wish to put on record my belief that there would be merit in allowing the House to discuss these matters in a full debate in the Chamber.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.13 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As was to be expected, many detailed points have been made this afternoon. I shall attempt to deal with them as methodically as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by drawing together some of the matters that were raised by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies), whose comments on tax harmonisation and approximation served to top and tail the debate. The Government have sought practical and workable ways in which to move toward the benefits of a single market. The Government's attitude to excise does not represent a change of heart. We continue to believe that centrally imposed tax rates are unnecessary for the completion of the single market. However, our European partners consider that centrally imposed rates for excise are necessary and there was a risk that they would refuse to move towards the abolition of fiscal frontiers if a deal on that matter were not concluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, that would have been too high a price to pay for a failure to agree to a package that made no practical difference to excise rates in the United Kingdom. In contrast, United Kingdom business had much to gain from the completion of the single market. As I said earlier, the agreement on excise rates, subject to the views of Parliament, did not oblige us to change any of our rates and was part of a sensible compromise package that protected British interests and took account of the views of other member states. We felt that there was no need to agree to a legally binding minimum for the standard rate of VAT because there was no need—this remains our view—for the community to become more involved with national tax rates than was absolutely necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
I shall deal later with duty-free goods, which was one of the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham asked why we agreed to the zero minimum rate on wine. It was agreed provisionally pending the Commission's report. Five member states currently have a zero rate on wine and there was no prospect of an agreement on a positive rate. Given that there was to be a report, we did not consider the zero rate on wine to be a sticking point in light of the whole agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham also mentioned the future of customs preventive controls. He will perhaps be aware that simpler checks on passengers are already being introduced. All fiscal and statistical checks on freight based on the single administrative document will be abolished from 31 December 1992 and will be replaced by inland audit controls, which will speed up the movement of goods across frontiers, subject only to essential anti-smuggling checks to protect society. They are very important, as are checks against drug trafficking and terrorists. Until the external EC frontiers are fully effective against those problems, the Government will need to retain essential checks at the UK-EC frontier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members referred to the scotch whisky industry, including the hon. Member for Wrexham, my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) and the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey). I cannot say much more about whisky. The proposed minimum rate of excise would have increased the price of a bottle of Scotch in Portugal by about £2 a bottle. That would have been a distortion and would have affected what we hope is an increasing and expanding export market for scotch whisky. Sales to the southern EC states represented about £300 million last year and the industry hopes to expand that to £400 million a year. Such an expansion would be threatened by the distortion that would result from the proposed minimum rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that we remain committed to the permanent retention of our ability to apply zero rates. That is a key point for the United Kingdom. As unanimous agreement is required on EC taxation matters; zero rates cannot be abolished if the UK is opposed. We have a right of veto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They could because the rule in force—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Am I wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful to my hon. Friend because she did not listen to my question.

However, my hon. Friend the Minister may wish to advise members of the Committee. I suspect that it may be a complicated issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the question of the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing) turns on restoring a zero rate that has been removed and on that, I cannot give him an answer.

We could not introduce new zero rates as matters stand. I shall have to let the hon. Gentleman know whether, if a zero rate were removed, a future Government would have the right to restore it because I do not know the answer and, given the rustling from beside me, neither do my officials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should all like to know the answer, so perhaps the Minister will copy her reply to all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that if VAT rates were not at zero last January, they cannot be introduced. But the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing) is intriguing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a different question and I do not know the answer.

In answer to the hon. Member for Wrexham, I am planning to see the cider manufacturers tomorrow. In respect of the channel tunnel and duty-free goods on trains, an international convention of the Customs Co-operation Council prevents the sale of duty-free goods on trains and at stations. There is no duty-free facility anywhere on trains in Europe. Indeed, the SNCF does not want a duty-free shop at the Gare du Nord, despite the obvious wish of all members of the Committee for such a facility. However, the international convention does not apply to the shuttle services between the tunnel terminals, which are on a par with the cross-channel ferries. To ensure even-handedness, it was agreed some time ago that the terminal sites could have duty-free shops if that was desired. I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not intend to ask me why there is an international convention, because I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand why the French SNCF does not want a customs-free shop at the Gare du Nord. However, it is a question of equity, and while that privilege exists, surely in the role that we are undertaking, we should take account of it. If the shuttle trains under the tunnel are not regarded as railways, could not an international train similarly cease to be regarded as an international train once it goes past the channel tunnel portals? Could the Minister get round the convention in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be very difficult to get round the convention, especially as this arrangement will apply only for a limited time. One is perhaps justified in trying to move the odd mountain if one thinks that it will a be a permanent arrangement, but to try to move a mountain for the sake of a transitional period that will end in 1999 is not justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the international convention exists because of the high risk of revenue fraud as people travel about on trains carrying with them contraband goods. Helpful as I like to be on Customs and Excise matters, I regret to tell the hon. Member for Wrexham that we shall not be expending much effort on moving this particular mountain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for further information about the exchange of information and confidentiality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another way of getting round the problem. The Treasury could give British Rail the revenue that it would have been given if the duty-free sales had been allowed, over and above the other funding for provincial services that is normally provided. Perhaps the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
can have a word with her right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to see whether that is an alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the problem is with British Rail; it is a problem with the international convention. That is the mountain that I am referring to; my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is not a mountain. There was very little support for this provision from other member states. We should have to win them round, but as the arrangement is being phased out anyway, it would not be worth the effort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood my hon. Friend the Minister to say that the SNCF does not want duty-free shop at the Gare du Nord. If that is so, we could have a duty-free shop at the British end, which would presumably be to our advantage. Would the international convention prevent us from having a duty-free shop for passengers before they board or after they leave the train at Waterloo or King's Cross? If we do not do that, we shall give a competitive advantage to airways, passenger ferries and the shuttle. Surely my hon. Friend the Minister would not want the market to be distorted in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone would think that that was a new distortion, but the international convention is longstanding. Careful discussions took place with British Rail, SNCF and with the German railways on whether they wished to have such an arrangement, but there was no support for it from other member states. The issue has arisen only because of the rail link in the channel tunnel and the arrangements for Cheriton and Coquelles. Given that few people want it—there are other enormous problems to solve—I shall, with your permission, Mr. Hill, pass on to the question of mutual assistance of administrative cooperation, which was raised by the hon. Member for Wrexham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A regulation on administrative co-operation covers the automatic exchange of information from VAT aggregate sales listings and provides for confidentiality to be safeguarded on that information. Confidentiality is a matter that greatly concerns the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors, which represent business. Their interests will be protected under the mutual assistance and administrative co-operation regulations.

Chewing tobacco is not a matter for the Treasury. Skoal Bandits, which contains oral snuff, was banned by the Department of Health. For technical reasons, the ban was struck down by the High Court, but the product is not being marketed in the United Kingdom while the Department of Health appeals. I understand that the European Community is also contemplating imposing its own ban. However I shall draw the matter to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister for Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham and my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham raised the subject of revenue loss from minimum indicative limits. Revenue loss of £1 billion on cigarettes alone has been calculated by London Economics on behalf of the tobacco industry. The figure is based on rather extreme assumptions and there are good reasons for believing that the loss is considerably overstated. The estimate ignores the revenue loss under the present arrangements for travellers' allowances and appears to be based on the assumption that the cross-border shopper would bring back the full allowance of duty-paid cigarettes on every trip, which is most unlikely. Many travelers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
would have their needs fully met below that quantity and others may be deterred by the not inconsiderable cost of financing such a purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as there is no precedent for such a big change in revenue arangements, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding any estimate of revenue loss, but, on the basis of the little evidence available, we expect the loss to be about £150 million to £250 million. Tobacco is likely to account for the bulk of that loss. Alcohol is heavier and is more difficult for individuals to transport in large quantities, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to refer again to scotch whisky, but perhaps I should not conclude without referring to the telling points made by my hon. Friend the Minister for Stamford and Spalding about duty free. He perceives an inconsistency in the continuance of duty free in a single market. He made a point about subsidy and, indeed, the industry claims that its income from duty free helps to subsidise airport charges and so on. We are talking not only about airports but about Gatwick and Heathrow and P and O and Sealink. Those are our four industry representatives of duty free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever one feels about the logic of continuing duty free in a single market, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding will accept that the industry needs time to adapt and to develop the marketing he described at Charles de Gaulle and other airports. I believe that my hon. Friend buys his bread at Frankfurt or Milan, so he is well accustomed to retail outlets in airports. The fact remains that Heathrow has been developing remarkably successful retail outlets in addition to its duty-free facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I accept the logic of my hon. Friend's argument, he must agree that these important industries need time to adapt, to prepare themselves and to develop the aggressive marketing policies that we find elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's position and congratulate her. The first duty of a Government is to defend the interests of their citizens. My hon. Friend is right, in the anomalous position in which we Lind ourselves, to make herself the advocate of British industrial and commercial interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern was twofold. First, in our energy and effort to do that, I did not want us to blind ourselved to the fundamental anomaly of the regime that we now have or to try to pretend to any lobby that that regime can, or should, be made to last forever. That is clear. Secondly, when major lobbies such as the brewers, Sealink, Gatwick, Heathrow, or whoever, asks for their position to be protected we must be suspicious in case they are trying to protect an oligopolistic position in a market that is not sufficiently competitive. To take again my example of beer, it may be that the British market is not competitive in that area. I believe that to be true and therefore it would be very advantageous if those brewers received more competition from foreign beer imports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that point. Certainly the opportunities afforded by a single market will provide competition. The whole point of today's discussion has been to show the Government's efforts to provide the fairest possible competition in the market that is clearly evolving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee can accept the resolution today. It reflects the Government's constructive and sensible approach to the Community. The approach is not negative as it is sometimes characterised; it is founded on common sense, the pursuit of the practical and the achievable, and on a policy of maximum consultation with United Kingdom business and trade interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been remarkable both at official and ministerial levels for trying to contribute positively to the debate. We have nogotiated strongly in pursuit of United Kingdom objectives and will continue to do so. We have tried to ensure that agreements, when reached, are the best that we can achieve for the United Kingdom. The agreements and proposals that the Committee have considered today reflect that approach. I hope that the Committee will approve them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Doucuments No. 6762/89 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by H. M. Customs and Excise on 15th July 1991 relating to completion of the Internal Market and approximation of indirect taxes, 6641/90 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memoranda submitted by H. M. Customs and Excise on 12th November 1990, 17th May 1991, 15th October 1991 and 25th November 1991 relating to the common system of Value Added Tax, 6642/90 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by H. M. Customs and Excise on 12th November 1991 on administrative co-operation in the field of indirect taxation, and 9670/90 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by H. M. Customs and Excise on 12th November 1991 on the general arrangements for the holding, movement and control of products subject to excise duty; and congratulates the Government on negotiating an agreement on indirect tax rates, which in particular safeguards the Government's right to continue its existing zero rates for VAT and an agreement on the VAT technical system which provides for the effective operation of the intra-Community VAT system after 1992, and includes provision for the continuation of intra-Community tax-free shopping for a transitional period, together with an agreement on enhanced administrative co-operation arrangements which will help to combat fraud; supports the proposals on the movement and control of excise goods, which in particular include provision for the continuation of intra-Community duty-free shopping for a transitional period, and for minimum indicative limits to distinguish between commercial and private cross-border transactions in alcohol and tobacco; and welcomes the significant progress which these agreements and proposals represent toward the abolition of fiscal frontiers and the creation of the single market.</p></q></p>
