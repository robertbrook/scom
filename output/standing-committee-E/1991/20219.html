	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I seek your guidance about the documentation that has been supplied to the Committee. The motion asks the Committee to welcome
	<br><blockquote><p>"the conclusions of the joint Energy/Environment Council of Ministers on 13th December and of ECOFIN on 16th December".</p></blockquote>
Neither of those documents has been provided by the Government. The document from the Joint Energy Environment Council is three or four pages long but does not cover all the points that are to be found in one of the explanatory memorandums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the conclusions of the Joint Energy/Environment Council of 29 October 1990 are unavailable to members of the Committee, even though we are supposed to welcome them. Moreover, the paper from the Economic and Finance Council refers to the proceedings of the "Fiscal Aspects' Group" on Community energy and CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> strategy. The record of those proceedings is of fundamental importance to the Committee's proceedings, yet it has not been supplied. How can the Committee proceed when two documents mentioned in the motion and two other documents have not been made available? I submit that we cannot proceed satisfactorily without those documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, I have accepted a motion for the adjournment of the Committee on a previous occasion because of the lack of documentation. I shall remind the hon. Gentleman that the criterion that I applied then was that the principal documents were not available. The principal document today—8918/91, from the European Commission to the European Council—is in the Committee's possession. Therefore, in my opinion it is appropriate for the Committee to proceed. However, I shall be interested in the references in the Minister's statement to the documents mentioned by the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. Surely the way out of this difficulty is for you to accept a manuscript amendment, as has been done in previous sittings of this Committee, deleting references to documents that have not been seen by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That course of action is open to the hon. Member for Bridgend or to any other hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.33 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Tony Baldry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that demonstrates that what the Whips are not involved in is always a problem in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
I am pleased that the Committee has taken the opportunity of considering this communication. No one should doubt that the threat of climate change, and the need to develop appropriate measures to mitigate it, are among the major environmental issues facing the world today. The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has shown that the global climate faces significant change because of the accumulation of man-made greenhouse gases. As such, possible measures to combat climate change, such as those presented in this communication, should be examined with care. It is right that the House of Commons should participate in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I give some brief details of the background to the communication, of its contents and of the international context in which it should be viewed. Some of the material has already been set out in the explanatory memorandum that I and my right hon. Friends the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Energy submitted on 5 December, and in the supplementary memorandum submitted on 11 February.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is the Minister correct in referring to those documents to which the Committee is not privy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that he can. I am sure that the Minister will explain the detailed point that he is making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady was not listening to what I said. The documents to which I referred are the very ones that have been made available to the Committee. Had the hon. Lady read them, some of what I am about to say would be familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this debate is taking place shortly before the Budget, Treasury Ministers cannot take part in it. Clearly, the taxation proposals in the communication are a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who will be interested in the Committee's views. I shall try to answer questions on tax issues; if I cannot, I, or my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury will write to hon. Members after the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The communication follows up the conclusion of the joint Energy/Environment Council of October 1990 that the Community should take action aiming at stabilisation of total CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions by the year 2000 at the 1990 level in the Community as a whole. This conclusion assumed that other leading countries would take similar action. It also acknowledged the targets already set by individual member states, including the target set by the United Kingdom of stabilising its emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2005, if other countries take similar action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's communication of October 1991 put forward a strategy for reaching the Community's target. This would consist of three elements: specific measures at Community level, fiscal measures, and national programmes. The communication was considered by the joint Energy/Environment Council in December last year. A copy of the council's conclusions was attached to the supplementary memorandum sent to the Committee last week. I hope that members of the Committee have had a chance to read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is precisely the point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member should know that the procedure in this Committee is that there will be no opportunity to ask questions until 11.33 am. The hon. Gentleman can ask the Minister a question then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The supplementary memorandum was sent to the Committee last week and the communication was also considered by a meeting of ECOFIN.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Energy/Environment Council agreed that member states would send to the Commission their national programmes for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, including strategies and targets for limiting CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. Existing programmes will be sent by April 1992 and the Commission will then assess the total contributions that these national programmes will make to the overall Community objective for CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub -->. The United Kingdom's strategy is set out in the 1990 White Paper on the Environment and in the subsequent first year report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The December council concluded that, in addition to national programmes, some measures need to be agreed at Community level. These include a strengthening, where necessary, of Community programmes. Among these are SAVE, a programme to promote energy efficiency improvements, THERMIE, a demonstrative programme to encourage the adoption of new and better energy technologies and JOULE, a research and development programme covering energy-saving technologies and energy options that are economically viable and environmentally safer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council also referred to the development of new and renewable energy sources, which would include the proposed ALTENER programme on renewable energy. Such measures are an integral part of a co-ordinated Community-wide approach to tackle CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The joint council concluded that these specific measures and the national programmes were unlikely to be sufficient in themselves to stabilise Community CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions and that higher energy pricing through fiscal instruments was likely to be needed. This fits with the United Kingdom Government's recognition in the environment White Paper that, in the long term, meeting the United Kingdom's conditional target will inevitably require increases in the relative price of energy and fuel, perhaps by taxation. A Community-wide carbon/energy tax, as suggested by the Commission, could therefore have an important role to play in limiting emissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of a carbon/energy tax raises a wide range of complex issues which need to be considered, including the economic and social consequences of such a tax, its implications for energy policy, the most appropriate base for the tax and how it is to be administered. The communication does not have much to say on these issues. The December council recognised the need for further analysis of the issue. This approach was endorsed by ECOFIN. The Commission is now to put forward formal proposals for a Community strategy by May, taking account of the further work required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission recognised that the unilateral imposition of a carbon/energy tax by the Community could damage the competitiveness of energy intensive industries engaged in international trade. It suggested that such effects might be alleviated through a system of exemptions. However, we do not believe that this idea is sensible. It carries the risk of creating a set of undesirable distortions and placing the burden of a tax on to other sectors of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The United Kingdom continues to believe that it would be sensible to implement a carbon/energy tax in the EC only if other countries took similar action. Concerted international action is the best way to proceed to limit global emissions—indeed, action by the Community alone might deliver no significant reduction in emission in the world as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is where the current negotiations on a framework convention on climate change are so important. These were set in motion in December 1990, when the United Nations established an Inter-Governmental Negotiating Committee to draw up a convention in time for signature during UNCED in June. The fifth meeting of the negotiating committee is currently taking place in New York and the United Kingdom is playing a leading role in the negotiations. There is still some way to go, but we are still hopeful of a successful convention, containing real commitments, being ready for June. That will form a sound basis for continuing efforts to mitigate the threat of climate change in the year a head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I take questions which, as I said, will continue until 11.30 am if need be, it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I advise members that I have accepted the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths). It is not altogether a bleak day. I hope that hon. Members will ask questions and not make speeches at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the statement in the motion that the Government and the Committee
	<br><blockquote><p>"welcome the conclusions of the joint Energy/Environment Council of Ministers on 13th December",</p></blockquote>
has the Government's policy on CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions changed? The communiqué issued on that date, which is in the Library, says unequivocally that Community policy objectives for climate change are the stabilisation of CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions at the 1990 level by the year 2000. The communiqué does not state that any country has made a reservation about that position. I want to know whether the final statement in the resolution contradicts that of welcoming the statement of 13 December. Have the Government changed their policy and brought it in line with that of the Labour party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our position is clear. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was not listening to what I said earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in the communiqué.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am endeavouring to answer the hon. Gentleman's question. He cannot criticise my answer until I have given it. We support fully the European Community's view that the Community should take action to stabilise total CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions by the year 2000 at the 1990 level throughout the Community. That conclusion assumed that other leading countries would take similar action. It also acknowledged the targets set already by individual member states, including the United Kingdom's target of stabilising its emissions at 1990 levels by 2005, if other countries take similar action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister answer the most vital question that we must consider? When the Single European Act was passed, we were told that changes in taxation would be a matter for unanimity. However, we are considering what seems to be a new tax, as the EC plans to add up to 25 per cent. or 30 per cent. to the price of fuels in Britain. I am sure that my hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Friend's excellent researchers will have considered the matter carefully, so can he assure us that this new tax cannot be imposed by a majority vote?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the National Rivers Authority shows that the source of the most serious pollution problems is the agriculture industry. Will my hon. Friend assure us that the Government will make abundantly clear that any extra burden that is put on industry, transport and power generation will be shared equally by the great polluting industry of agriculture? The crucial question, however, is whether such a tax can be imposed on us by a majority vote. Can my hon. Friend assure us that that cannot be done, except by unanimity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have to be done by unanimity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister outline the research projects that are taking place in this country into the impact of this major physical change? What timetable is envisaged for the changes that appear to impinge on transport? Will he make clear at what point the Government intend to take a decision that will be made known to the House of Commons? The proposal involves the imposition of a large new tax and will need to be made transparent before we can discuss it further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I hoped I had made clear in my opening comments, we are a considerable way away from making decisions about the imposition of an energy/carbon tax. This country is undertaking much research into the projected levels of emissions of CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> over the next decade and is also doing a great deal of work into what measures could be taken to help us meet our target to reduce CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub -->. Therefore, much work is done to support our energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes—about £54 million is being spent to support the research programme into renewable energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my opening comments, the information from the Commission on how an energy/carbon tax would operate is still very thin. It is not clear why the Commission chose, for example, the figure of $10 a barrel in its proposal. I understand that that is the Commission's estimate of the price rise that will be needed to stabilise Community emissions of CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> at their current level, taking into account the other measures in the Commission's communication, but estimates in this area depend crucially on the modelling assumptions that are used. Our estimates of United Kingdom CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions in the year 2000 cover a large range, depending on the assumptions used, from 3 per cent. below the current level to 11 per cent. above it. That contrasts with the Commission's forecast for the United Kingdom of 13 per cent. above. There are still many that the Commission and others must consider before there can be any suggestion of a carbon/energy tax being introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the carbon tax is introduced, as I expect it will be, does the Minister think that it should operate in a fiscally neutral way? In other words, when it is introduced will he expect to see other taxes in the United Kingdom being reduced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the challenges of introducing a tax of this sort. Undoubtedly the proposed tax would increase the price of energy, adding to costs and prices generally. In principle, its effects could be offset by using revenues to cut other taxes by seeking, as my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie) suggested, to make it fiscally neutral. In practice the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
outcome would depend on whether the tax was introduced unilaterally and on how different industries and consumers responded. Calculations of the effect of a new tax depend crucially on the details of the economic models used. The Commission's forecasts of the macroeconomic effects of the tax on output and prices are small. While in theory it will be possible to have a fiscally neutral tax, it is as yet difficult to project what the impact will be on different industries and different groups in society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree with the quite large body of research that has already been undertaken on the use of carbon taxes to reduce demand, which has shown that energy demand does not respond strongly to price rises? The overall result of the research is pessimistic. On the occasions when there have been sharp rises in the oil price leading to a significant reduction of demand, a major element in that reduction has been the recession induced by the high oil price. Will not the Minister therefore admit that the concept of high energy taxes permanently to reduce demand is flawed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our position is clear. We believe that national programmes are unlikely in the long term to be sufficient in themselves to stabilise Community CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions and that higher energy pricing through fiscal instruments is likely to be needed. We believe that in the long term the United Kingdom's conditional target will inevitably require increases in the relative price of energy and fuel, perhaps by taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend the Minister give us a clear and specific assurance that if we go ahead with this appalling Common Market tax on energy the Government will argue that agriculture, which is the serious polluter in Britain, will be treated in exactly the same way as other industries? The Minister must be aware that in places like Southend on Sea where industry faces major problems with, among other things, new taxes, there is a feeling that agriculture has received an unfair special treatment. Agriculture unfortunately causes appalling regular pollution. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the Government will press for the tax to apply to agriculture as well as to transport and industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no reason why the tax should not apply to every industrial sector, but the proposal that energy-intensive industries might be exempt is one of the uncertainties that needs to be resolved. As I said in response to an earlier question, it is difficult to predict how the burden of the tax would fall on different sectors and groups in the economy. The Commission argues that energy-intensive sectors, such as the steel industry should be exempt from the tax, to ensure that the Community's competitiveness is not seriously damaged. That is understandable; it is why the Government do not favour the unilateral introduction of a tax without a commitment from other countries to take similar action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government see CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions and the enhanced greenhouse effect as a global problem that requires a global solution. We are, therefore, determined to work with the intergovernmental panel on climate change to organise a framework convention at the earth summit in Rio later this year. The Government are delighted that the Prime Minister has made it clear that he will attend the summit in Rio. That is a clear sign of the Government's support for finding a global solution to a global problem. A system of exemptions, for agriculture or the steel
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
industry, will create new distortions. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) and I agree that there should be no new distortions. Such distortions would place greater burdens on other sectors of the economy and be a poor substitute for co-ordinated global action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government accept the principle of a tax but query its form, proposed exemptions from it and its long-term effects? Other matters are outlined in the EC document. Irrespective of the effect of carbon taxes in Sweden, where there is clear evidence that they do not work, does the Minister accept the principle of the tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me be absolutely clear. I hope that the White Paper "This Common Inheritance" made it clear that if we were to reach our target of stabilising CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions at 1990 levels by 2005, provided that other countries took similar action, the relative price of energy and fuel would inevitably rise, perhaps through taxation. A Community-wide energy tax, as proposed by the Commission, could play an important role in limiting emissions. But we wish to ensure that such a tax is not introduced unilaterally in the Community. If that happened, and other parts of the world did not take similar action, it could distort our competitiveness and, ironically, increase CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions globally instead of reducing them. It is important that we take action as part of an overall strategy to reduce global CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub -->emissions. It is, therefore, important also that the framework convention, which is being negotiated in New York, is successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it part of the Government's policy to promote non-CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub -->-producing energy generation, especially nuclear power? What efforts are being made to develop new forms of nuclear power, especially for domestic use, such as the research proposals of my constituents at Rolls-Royce?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Government are firmly committed to a range of sources of energy including nuclear power. As my hon. Friend will know, Sizewell B is being constructed. I hope that it will finish on target for time and cost. The Government have agreed that once it has been completed there will be a review of nuclear energy as a fuel source. My hon. Friend is right. There are many excellent British companies which have contributed first-class research work to the peaceful development of nuclear power in this country. Sizewell B must be one of the largest civil engineering projects in the country, perhaps second only to the channel tunnel. It will be an amazing achievement for British technology and engineering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nuclear power does not generate CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub -->. It is ironic that the Opposition are committed to phasing out nuclear power, which will mean an increase in carbon emissions of about 10 per cent. each year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister familiar with a piece of research by Baker and Lewney? I am familiar with their conclusions but not the whole of the paper, which is why I ask; in case his civil servants have provided him with more detail than I have. Baker and Lewney carried out a study of the sort of tax regime on energy that would be needed in the United Kingdom to meet the Government's target of stabilisation of CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions at their 1990 levels by 2005. They estimated that the tax regime would require
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
a 132 per cent. increase in tax on coal, a 92 per cent. increase in tax on oil and a 48 per cent. increase in tax on gas and an overall increase of 27 per cent. in electricity prices. I assume that they considered the tax regime in isolation and did not take into account other programmes such as energy efficiency or alternative energy development. Can the Minister confirm that? If they used that method, what impact would the Government's energy efficiency and alternative energy development programmes have on moderating the suggested price increases, which would be horrendous for industry and individuals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member conceded fairly in his question, one can arrive at almost any figure for an energy/carbon tax depending on the hypothesis on which it is based. A host of people have come to different conclusions. However, if we relied on an energy/carbon tax alone to deliver the CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> reductions, that would result in one set of figures. Those figures would be extremely suspect because, as I hoped that I had made clear earlier, the estimates of United Kingdom CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions in the year 2000 cover a large range. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy answered a question just before Christmas 1991 and gave the range of new projections. Our estimates for CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions in 2000, depending on the assumptions used, can range from 3 per cent. below the current level to 11 per cent. above. That is if we do nothing at all and carry on business as usual. That is one variable. Any fiscal measures would be part of an overall package which could include the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made it clear that such measures could also include some fuel switching. There are several new proposals for more efficient gas-fired electricity generation. The introduction of competition in the electricity industry will reduce CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. There is a host of variables. It is unhelpful and potentially misleading to say what energy costs will be on one set of variables if no other action is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to understand why the Commission talks of increasing the energy component by the equivalent of $3 a barrel rising to $10 a barrel by the year 2000, with the current price of oil at about $20 a barrel. The host of variables is too uncertain, which makes it difficult to give clear estimates. More work will have to be done on the detail of any proposed energy/carbon tax before we can assent to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What specific programmes in research and development are taking place in this country? What percentage of them have an input from the EC money and what timescale does the Minister envisage for research programmes which will be needed specifically for fuel switching?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a host of research being carried out in this country. The Building Research Establishment is carrying out research on how we make our home more energy efficient with home-energy labelling, cavity wall insulation and condensing boilers. Other research work is being done on promoting renewable energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) will know that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Energy with responsibility for renewable energy has commissioned a range of research work on renewable energy from landfill, gas and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
waste and on the promotion of tidal and wind power. There is a range of research projects in every area of renewable energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the host of Community research projects such as SAVE, THERMIE, JOULE and others in which we are involved. I am happy to make available to the Committee a detailed list of every research project in which we are involved. An impressive number are being undertaken on the promotion of energy efficiency, renewable energy and ways to reduce CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister include in that list information about which programmes have EC funding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of them are European Community programmes conducted on a Community-wide basis. We are involved in those. Others are United Kingdom programmes, but I am happy to give the hon. Lady a full list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On page 5 of the communiqué, the Commission refers to least-cost planning as a proposal for the future. Given the good experience of that of many utilities in the United States, can the Minister say what progress has been made in the Community towards producing such a proposal, which could have a significant impact on carbon dioxide emissions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Least-cost planning at Community level is something that the Commission will consider. The way that energy is delivered varies between Community countries. In this country, where the generator and distributor are separate, there may be less scope for least-cost value than in other Community countries. Those issues will inevitably be considered because the Community will have to consider a range of Community-level measures to enable it to meet its own target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the same document, the Commission referred to energy and green auditing to make companies conscious of the energy that they use. Do the Government have plans for business and industry in the United Kingdom to carry out such compulsory audits and to have them included in annual company reports to encourage further reductions of carbon dioxide emissions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most sensible companies would conduct energy audits as a matter of course because energy efficiency is environmentally sound and makes good economic sense. The Energy Efficiency Office, which is part of the Department of Energy, gives much advice to industry and business about being more energy efficient. The utilities increasingly advise businesses and companies about how to become more energy efficient. There are financial incentives for every business and company to be as environmentally and energy efficient as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are keen that that should also be true for householders. The Government have produced a common methodology for effective home-energy labelling. Householders who tried to make their homes energy efficient had difficulty in knowing what measures would achieve that end—what would be the impact of installing double glazing, a gas-condensing boiler or cavity wall insulation. We have overcome those problems. It will soon be possible for people to have their homes energy labelled. When people buy or sell houses, I hope that they will, as a matter of course, be interested in the home-energy labelling rating in the same way that people today are
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
interested in knowing the community charge of an area. Those are important signals to organisations, companies and households about becoming more energy efficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What specific information was given to the Council of Ministers about the effect of a carbon tax in the countries where one has been applied? What information do British Ministers have about comparable schemes elsewhere and what is their final analysis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part of the problem is that few countries have instituted anything akin to a carbon tax. The only example that I know of is Sweden, where they have got into a muddle over energy policy. They sought to phase out nuclear power but realised that that would cause difficulties in meeting sensible carbon dioxide emission targets and for energy policy in general. Sweden may adopt a more rational energy policy as a result of the change to a Conservative Government for the first time in some years. There are few international examples of carbon or energy taxes with which we can make comparisons. That is why so much of the work done on such taxes is, by definition, theoretical and based on a number of more or less tendentious hypothesis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have already announced that in principle more freight should be transferred from road to rail. Given the importance that such a transfer would have for the transport sector, have the Government gone beyond making a declaratory statement to developing a programme of objectives linking the greater use of rail freight with reductions in CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Transport has introduced freight facilities grants, which are intended to provide help towards meeting the costs of rail freight facilities where they provide a worthwhile environmental benefit. The European Commission is working on a wide-ranging paper on transport and the environment, which may be published later this month. It is difficult to comment on that paper before it has been published, but the Government support high levels of investment in public transport. Transport has an important part to play in meeting our CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emission reduction target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first, Mr. Hogg, apologise for missing the beginning of these proceedings? The Labour Whips seem to have no regard for my energies and once again have put me in two Committees at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister aware that one of the market leaders in renewable energy was a company called Howdens, in Renfrew? That company researched and produced wind turbines and engaged in clean-coal technology. It had an extremely difficult period during the Gulf war, during which the Government were unwilling to intervene with bridging assistance, and it has now closed. Will the Minister say whether the Government, under this directive, would be willing to invest in similar companies, not only for research but for manufacture?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government, through the creation of the initial market for electricity generation by means of the non-fossil fuel obligation in the Electricity Act 1989, have already given renewable sources of energy a great boost towards commercial development. Electricity generated from renewable resources gets a premium price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The second non-fossil fuel obligation order laid last November involved 122 projects. The two orders laid to date have quadrupled the renewable sources capacity contracted to regional electricity companies since 1990. With industry, the Government support research and development programmes to develop technologies relevant to our market and have invested £180 million into research and development of renewable energy. A further £24 million has been allocated for the coming year. That shows that the Government are both investing in research and development and boosting renewable energy projects through the structure of the Electricity Act 1990, which provided for the privatisation of the electricity industry and for the non-fossil fuel obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has accepted the principle of the imposition of an energy tax. What suggestions does he have for the money thus raised and its effect on neutrality? How does he reconcile the Commission's statement on page 10 that it will have little effect on growth with the assessment, in the same paragraph, that it will lead to a decline in the overall improvement of the economies of individual member states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lest there be any misunderstanding, what we have accepted is not a tax in principle. I made it clear that the Government recognise that our conditional target may inevitably require increases in the relative prices of energy and fuel, perhaps by means of taxation, and that a Community-wide carbon/energy tax, as suggested by the Commission, could play an important role in limiting emissions. However, as I hope that I have made clear, there are an enormous amount of questions, as yet unanswered, about any proposed carbon/energy tax, which would make it difficult for us to give a sensible value judgment on the wisdom of introducing any particular tax in any particular way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich has very sensibly referred to one of the problems which must be resolved. The hon. Lady asks what would be done with the money raised from the tax. The Commission's view, as is clear from the paper, is that the tax should be revenue neutral. That was agreed last year by member states in working-group discussions. One risk of introducing a new indirect tax would be an upward impact on price. We do not have much information yet about the distribution of the impact of the proposed tax on different income levels, so there must be concern about poorer families. This issue would have to await the detailed specification of the tax. We would need to consider carefully how far, and through what mechanisms, low-income families could be protected. There are a host of questions which have yet to be answered and on which considerably more detailed work needs to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that although neutrality might be achieved in terms of the revenue received by the Government, and although it may be possible to introduce measures to ensure that industry can counter-balance the extra money that it has to expend on the energy tax with reductions in other taxation or greater reliefs on profits, there is no way that all individuals can be given tax neutrality when a high carbon tax is imposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It inevitably follows that whenever a new tax is introduced, the burden of that tax may fall disproportionately on different groups and industries in society. That must be taken into account when considering whether to introduce a carbon/energy tax and what sort of carbon/energy tax to introduce. Some of the issues raised this morning—the exemption of certain industries, the burden falling equally on all industries, the position of low-income families—are evidence of some of those difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend the Minister give us any information about what has been happening to carbon dioxide emissions in this country? I realise that that may be slightly difficult to answer off the top of his head, but it would be very helpful if he could give us some information for 1988, 1989, 1990 and, if possible, 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that not much time is left for questions. The best that I can do is refer my hon. Friend to a written answer given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy on 6 December 1991. It is a fairly lengthy answer and I shall send a copy to my hon. Friend. It shows that our best estimates of United Kingdom Co	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions between now and the year 2000 cover a large range—from 3 per cent. below to 11 per cent. above current levels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is not what I asked. I asked what we know about what has happened in the recent past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I misunderstood the question. My right hon. Friend's answer of 6 December demonstrated that in 1991 our emissions were about 1 per cent. up on 1990.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have the Government specifically commissioned any research into the effects of the fiscal changes and the type of fiscal incentive that would be necessary to produce the changes that are proposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister must reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that work will be, and is being, done on a range of projections of the impact of any carbon or energy tax on the economy. The Treasury would do such straightforward ongoing work as a matter of course when considering any fiscal measures that the Government or the Community may introduce. However, I do not think that such work would be done as a specific research project in the way that the hon. Lady suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stopped the Minister from consulting his officials, but it is open to him during the debate that will follow this question time to answer a question if an answer was not readily available when it was asked. I am merely trying to be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I want to give the Committee the fullest possible answers. Sometimes Ministers need to seek their officials' advice, particularly on an issue such as this where several Departments are involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but as the time for questions is limited, responsibility falls on me not to allow a great gap of silence. Apart from anything else, it is difficult to minute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite a while since I sat on a European Standing Committee. Is it now in order for me to speak to my amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I must rule myself out of order if I have confused hon. Members. Questions will end at 11.33 am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a former lecturer in horticulture I am aware of the importance that plants can play both environmentally and aesthetically. Has the Minister received the excellent publication from the Horticultural Trades Association outlining the benefits provided by plants? Will funding be available for research projects into the benefits that derive from plants? Furthermore, could planting projects be funded under the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that in terms of per capita carbon dioxide emissions, Britain ranks eighth as a major polluter in Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ranking of the various member states often reflects the fact that we have become more energy efficient in recent years. Indeed, we have been increasing our gross national product over the past decade while not using much more energy than we did 10 years ago. That speaks well for the initiatives that have been taken in promoting energy efficiency. Many businesses recognise that it is in their own best commercial interests to be energy efficient. None of us, however, can ignore the fact that carbon dioxide emissions present a challenge to us and to the whole world. It is a global challenge which needs a global solution. We are prepared to play our part in meeting that challenge at a worldwide and Community level. If countries consider that they are not as bad as others and that they therefore need not take combined actions, we may not reach the sorts of agreements that will be essential if the world community is to act together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government accept the Commission's suggestion that there should be a 50–50 split between carbon and energy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we do not necessarily accept that split. How much would be carbon and how much would be energy is still a matter of debate. Various other member states have considerably different views on that. In France, where so much energy is generated from nuclear power, they clearly have a different view about what proportion should be carbon related and what proportion should be energy related in countries such as ours, where the balance of fuel generation is somewhat more in harmony. That is another instance where the details will need to be worked out. A great deal of work still needs to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify a point made in the communiqué of the joint Environment Energy Council, which was not made available to us in the normal way for the debate even though it was mentioned in the motion tabled by the Government. The final paragraph refers to instructing
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Commission to continue its preparatory work on a Community strategy so as to allow a Council Decision in May 1992 at the latest."</p></blockquote>
That is in connection with the intergovernmental committee on climate change. Will that decision on climate change and CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions be entirely divorced from any decision on an energy or a carbon tax, or is it intended to have the outlines of the carbon tax in place by May 1992 so that a statement can be ready for the UNCED meeting in Brazil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I say for the avoidance of doubt that the conclusions of the joint Energy Environment Council
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
and ECOFIN were attached to the supplementary memorandum as stated in paragraph 1.6. The only document that was not sent to the Committee was the conclusions of the Fiscal Aspects Group, which is a Council working group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister conclude his answer. I will take a point of order after that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Member states have been asked to send national programmes for limiting greenhouse gas emissions to the Commission by April of this year. ECOFIN is now considering further what work to take forward and the timetable for it. The Commission is now drawing up formal proposals. It is not clear when they will be brought forward but it is anticipated that tax proposals could be discussed at the ECOFIN meeting at the end of April.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I must protest at the Minister's statement. The explanatory memorandum contains and refers to a summary of the proceedings of the Energy Environment Council and of ECOFIN. The two documents were not attached to that explanatory memorandum. I received the documents for this Committee at the end of last week. As additional documents often appear nearer to the time that the Committee sits, I went back to see whether there were any more. Therefore, I am absolutely confident that unless they went to the Library hon. Members do not have copies of the communication issued after the ECOFIN meeting and the Energy Environment council meeting on 13 December.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of order for me is whether that documentation should necessarily be before the Committee. I have ruled on that already. I understand the argument that the hon. Member for Bridgend is having with the Minister. The question for me is whether the Committee can discuss competently the motion before it. The answer, which I have given already, is yes. As I see it, that is the only point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 8918/91 relating to the Community strategy to limit carbon dioxide emissions and to improve energy efficiency and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Department of the Environment on behalf of HM Treasury, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Energy on 11th February 1992; welcomes the conclusions of the joint Energy/Environment Council of Ministers on 13th December and of ECOFIN on 16th December as a positive step forward in agreeing a coherent and co-ordinated approach across the Community to limiting carbon dioxide emissions; endorses the Government's view that further analytical work on the likely effects of any Community-wide energy/carbon tax is required before any decisions on such a tax can be taken; and supports the Government's intention to continue to work towards its conditional target of returning United Kingdom carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2005, as part of the international efforts to combat the threat of climate change.</p></blockquote>
I am sorry if the debate seems to have been slightly soured by the question of what documents were or were not available to the Committee. On reflection, part of the problem may be the membership of the Committee. I understand that the documents were not attached to the supplementary explanatory memorandum because they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
had been sent already by the Department to members of the Committee under cover of a letter from the parliamentary clerk in the Department of the Environment. Members of the Committee may have received the documents but, of course, the hon. Member for Bridgend is not a member of the Committee. I am happy to discuss the matter afterwards with the hon. Gentleman, but that highlights a problem about those who attend the Committee and those who are actually members of it. I do not want to have an unnecessary spat with the hon. Gentleman, as the problem may have been genuine. The Committee is still in its infancy and we all have lessons to learn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken already at length and answered many questions. Therefore, in opening the debate, I do not intend to detain the Committee long, not least because I know that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Energy will wish to contribute to our discussion on the measures that we are taking to promote energy efficiency. I simply wish to reiterate that no one should doubt that we are debating a significant issue. The threat of climate change is one of the major environmental issues facing the world today. It is a global issue; all countries could suffer from its impact and all contribute in some way to the problem. The attitude that countries will need to adopt to respond to that challenge will cover all sectors of the economy and involve every individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want first to comment on the current scientific view on climate change as I did not have a chance to do so during our question period. It is not always easy to get a clear picture of what scientists are saying about such a complex issue. We are not always sure who or what to believe. However, there is consensus that the best source of information is the 1990 report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, which represented the view of more than 300 leading scientists working on climate change issues. It concluded that concentrations of greenhouse gases will increase substantially in future even if emissions remain constant. As a result, global temperature is expected to rise by about one third of a degree every 10 years, faster than at any time in the past 10,000 years. Many uncertainties remain about the consequences of such an increase, but the changes that might result could have major effects on the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A supplementary report has just been approved by the IPCC, which does not alter the fundamental conclusions. It shows that there are complications. The rate of global warming is affected by sulphur pollution and by the depletion of the ozone layer. Those effects are reducing the rate of global warming, perhaps by almost one third, but they will not have much influence on the long-term problem. Taking those effects into account has made scientists more confident of their models, which predict that global warming will occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The global nature of the climate change threat means that it is essential that we make as much effort as possible to combat it. That is why the framework convention on climate change, now being negotiated, is so important. Measures to combat climate change will be ineffective if taken by individual nations acting alone. For example, the United Kingdom accounts for only 3 per cent. of world emissions of CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> and the European Community accounts for about 13 per cent. A co-ordinated response, with
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
commitments from all countries, is the only way forward, Unilateral action by the United Kingdom or by the Community would risk damaging our economic prosperity without achieving any significant reduction in world emissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is playing a leading role in those negotiations. We are looking for an effective and workable convention, containing real commitment, to be ready in time for this year's United Nations convention on environment and development. Key commitments would be for developed countries to take a lead by giving a specific commitment to stabilise their CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions and for all countries to draw up national plans describing how they propose to limit greenhouse gas emissions. There is still some way to go. Differences remain between negotiating parties, but we are still hopeful of having a convention that can be signed in June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Community and its member states have been ahead of possible convention commitments by setting targets for limiting CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. At present, targets focus on CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub -->. In the long run, it will be right for limitation measures to focus on all greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide. However, we know less about those gases than we do about CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> So, to begin with, we must aim for CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom has already given a great deal of thought to its national strategy, as set out in the 1990 White Paper. As I have already mentioned, we intend to return our CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions to 1990 levels by 2005. That target is conditional on other countries committing themselves to similar action, but we believe that it is a realistic and achievable target and have already introduced measures that will help to achieve it. The White Paper set out several measures to improve energy efficiency and we are continuing to look at ways of achieving potential savings to the economy in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last November, the Secretaries of State for Energy and for the Environment announced a major new publicity campaign designed to encourage energy efficiency in the home. The White Paper also set out measures for making greater use of renewable energy and reducing emissions from transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Community has adopted the objective of stabilising total CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions in the Community by the year 2000 at the 1990 level. That commitment assumes that other leading countries will also take action. It is fair to say that there remains some way to go in developing a Community strategy to achieve the target. The Commission's communication is a useful start. There is no doubt that it needs to be followed up by more detailed work and analysis, but it is an important first step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, the communication was considered by the joint Environment Energy Council, which met in December. The Government welcome the conclusions of the Council. We welcome its recognition that the Community's strategy must be based on a package of Community and national measures as there is a need to balance the measures. When we consider Community strategy, it is easy to forget the need for national programmes, allowing member states to take the approach that best suits them. Indeed, we have always stressed the importance of national programmes. If all member states draw up national plans, the Community will be better able to judge what concerted action is needed to meet its objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
We accept that Community-wide measures could help. We agree that improvement of existing Community programmes such as SAVE, JOULE and THERMIE, as suggested in the communication, may be necessary. If proposals can be fully considered in time, we want the ALTENER programme on renewable energy to be adopted during our presidency. We have suggested to the Commission suitable areas that the ALTENER programme could cover and have encouraged it to table a proposal as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the national strategies and Community measures that I have described may not be enough. The Energy/Environment Council recognises that higher energy pricing through the use of fiscal instruments is likely to be needed to complement other measures. We have always made it clear that, in the long run, energy prices might need to rise to help tackle carbon dioxide emissions. The environment White Paper said that higher energy prices would be necessary to achieve the United Kingdom's carbon dioxide emission target. The Commission's idea of a carbon energy tax, which forms one of the central planks of the communication, is therefore potentially an important component of a co-ordinated strategy to reduce emissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need hardly tell the Committee that the Commission's ideas have aroused considerable interest. I and my colleagues in a wide range of Government Departments have received many letters and representations about the tax. We understand that. A carbon energy tax would be a very significant measure, with wide-ranging consequences for all sectors of society. It is vital that we consider carefully the benefits and costs before taking any decision on its introduction. We must consider its macroeconomic and social effects; its effects on trade, competitiveness and energy markets; its overall effects on world emissions of CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> and its effects on the economies of other nations. We must also consider the important questions of the tax base and how the tax should be operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The communication does not really tackle those issues. That came out in today's question and answers. It talks of a particular rate of tax and a particular split between taxing carbon and energy contents of fuel, but does not give a convincing analysis of why that particular specification was chosen, still less does it go into the issues that I have already mentioned. That is why we pressed at the Energy/Environment Council for further work. We welcomed the Council's conclusions, which pointed to the need for further study on those complex matters, and the subsequent conclusions of ECOFIN, which endorsed that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect the Commission to come back with formal proposals in the next few months. We hope that they will contain some of the detail that has been lacking to date and be backed by proper analysis. That analysis is essential before a decision can be taken on the principle of a carbon energy tax within the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motion before the Committee reflects the importance that the United Kingdom Government attach to the issue of climate change. We recognise the need for action. That is why we have moved to limit United Kingdom emissions and have said that we are willing to set a target that we mean to achieve. We have welcomed the call from the Energy-Environment Council for Community member states to draw up national plans and for the improvement of Community programmes. We also acknowledge that a carbon energy tax might be a useful
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
means of limiting emissions, although we want more work to be done before a decision is reached. We stress international co-operation and agreements in this area. That is reflected in our strong efforts to negotiate a framework convention on climate change. I therefore commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.48 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the motion, in line 11, leave out from 'taken' to end and add
	<br><blockquote><p>'calls on the Government to accept the European Community target of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000, and to make a significant reduction after that date, as part of international efforts to combat the threat of climate change.'.</p></blockquote>
The motion is straightforward up to the point where we are asked to support the Government's target of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2005. The Minister made two unsustainable points. First, he said that the Commission's proposal, or at least the concept of a carbon tax, was potentially important for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. He also said that the Government regarded a carbon tax as a useful means of limiting emissions. We do not accept that. The Minister's answers and the qualification that the Government want further analytical work on the likely effects of a Community-wide energy carbon tax before a decision is made underline the difficulties of using high carbon energy taxes to reduce consumption permanently. Evidence shows that either such taxes do not work, or they have to be incredibly high in order to work. If high taxes were used, the achievement of fiscal neutrality would significantly affect other Government revenue-raising powers, which could lead to a savage recession. That would achieve the reductions in energy consumption, but at an unacceptable cost to the country, the economy and individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We reject the principle of using high carbon energy taxes to reduce consumption permanently. Our view is encapsulated in our amendment: we believe that the Community target of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000 can be achieved in the United Kingdom without high energy taxes, and that it is possible to achieve reductions after that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we envisage the worldwide problem among developing economies as a three-lane motorway, we see that the United Kingdom and the United States are in the slow lane for cleaning up carbon dioxide emissions; countries that cruise gently in the middle lane include Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Japan, Norway and Switzerland; and countries in the fast lane are Australia, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The fast-lane countries seek to achieve reductions in CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions not through high energy taxes, but through regulation, incentives to be more fuel-efficient and penalties and fines for those who fail to meet the targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Edwina Currie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that Germany does not use a carbon tax? Germany substantially subsidises coal production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that Germany supports its coal industry more generously than most other countries, including the United Kingdom. However, we should not concentrate on specific fuels, but consider whether, given the mixture of fuels that is used, the targets can be achieved. A whole range of technologies can now be used
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
in the coal industry to produce the same amount of energy with considerable reductions in CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. We should not, therefore, home in on any particular fuel, but consider the Community target of stabilising emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, and introduce measures to achieve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I mentioned matters such as least-cost planning. The Minister spoke about advances in energy rating that will allow homes to be labelled according to an energy league table and domestic appliances to be rated on energy efficiency. Such work is well under way in the United States, and it is possible that within a year or so similar legal requirements could be instituted in the United Kingdom. That would begin to make an impact on energy efficiency and the development of alternative energy sources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be even more effective for the Government to give considerable incentives to old-age pensioners on very low incomes? They would benefit immediately from having their houses properly insulated. That would save energy and materially improve their standard of living.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The Government's programme in such matters is not wide enough, although there will be some improvements. For example, in the gas sector, the "E" factor to be employed in the development of pricing policy will help to reduce CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. However, a more positive approach must be adopted in the privatised utilities and in the public sector coal industry to ensure that those industries give top priority to the efficient production of energy. It is well known that public utilities in the United States give their consumers low-energy light bulbs and energy-efficient refrigerators as a way of avoiding the cost of building new power stations. Many possible measures already exist to reduce fuel consumption and CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emission, and to meet the Community target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Governnment must recognise the fallacy of a policy that can be summed up as, "If other countries won't reduce or stabilise their CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions, we won't either". That ignores a serious problem and contributes to making it worse. The United Kingdom, especially in the context of the European Community, should take definite steps to achieve the reductions in energy consumption and CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. A high energy tax policy is not necessary for that, and international competitiveness need not be hampered. One of the weaknesses of the proposals is that high-energy-using industries will be exempted in some way. Surely one of the purposes of a policy to reduce CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions is to give the greatest encouragement to such industries to make reductions. Logically, the full weight of any carbon tax that might be adopted should fall on such industries in order to achieve big cuts in energy consumption. The Commission's approach on this matter displays a certain irrationality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that an energy consumption and CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> reduction strategy could incorporate a small carbon levy that would not restrict the level of activity in United Kingdom industry by raising its costs exorbitantly, nor push up the retail prices index unnecessarily. The money raised could be used for research and development to promote energy efficiency and alternative forms of energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government are prepared to accept our amendment at this late stage. It is in line with EC policy
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
and the Commission document. I made such a fuss about not having the two documents because after I received the papers by going to pick them up, I found that the United Kingdom had decided to accept the EC objectives. I was hoping that that last-minute conversion would mean that our amendment would get an easy ride. I still hope that it will and that the Committee will see the common sense of accepting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a week when Susan and Neil Carter in "The Archers", having bought their council house, are having their loft insulated, this is an important subject to discuss. It is a tragedy that it is being discussed in a Committee with such a small, although very distinguished, group of members. The subject is much more important than fox-hunting, which 400 Members debated on Friday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concur with the Minister's view. It is essential that policies to reduce CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions should be realistic, but we must have such policies. It is not enough to make fine noises in ECOFIN, at the Council of Europe in May or the Rio conference in June and to sign documents that have no teeth and no bite. If that is all we do, we will be having the same debate in five years' time in a climate of 90 deg F in the winter, and in 20 years from now our children will want to know why we took no action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Britain, we already have a substantial carbon tax. Coal is traded from British Coal at £43·77 per tonne. On the world market the OECD price for similar coal is £28 per tonne. The Library informs me that if we used coal at the world price, a saving allocated only to domestic users would be about £55 per year, or £1 per week. That is the carbon tax that we have now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that if Britain became a major purchaser on the world coal market, the price of coal would be pushed up? Therefore, the advantage to the consumer would not be as great as she envisages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would happen if we switched over overnight, but we shall switch over gradually. Companies such as PowerGen and National Power have concluded agreements with ports, which enable them to import coal at a slowly increasing rate. As a result, new coal deposits are opening up all over the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am on record as saying in my area, which is a former coal-producing area, that I should like British Coal to develop over the next few years in the same way as British Petroleum. British expertise, energy, initiative and capital should be used to develop coal deposits all over the world. Britain should become not only a producer but a major trader. That policy would produce more high-quality employment in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already have a carbon tax that amounts to £1 per week for a domestic user of electricity in Britain. The figures for Germany are even more horrendous. I am amazed that it is able to reduce carbon emissions. On my recent visit to Nordhrein Westfalen I found that domestically produced coal was being traded in Germany at about 230 deutschmarks per tonne, which is over £70—nearly twice as much as our coal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very impressed by the careful work that the hon. Lady has done. Has she estimated the cost to the consumer of the artificial price increases agreed by the Government when they allowed privatisation to go ahead, so certain companies can charge above the rate of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
the retail prices index? Has she also estimated the cost to the consumer of the outrageous wage rises that were awarded to people in privatised industries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should look at the total wage bill. As I am sure she is aware, that is what will affect the price that is set. In this country, 400 to 500 people run a power station, but in Germany the equivalent power station is run by about 50 people. That may be the explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be something to do with investment in machinery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be an explanation of one of the elements of difference between us and Germany. As we move towards privatisation and liberalisation of the coal market and as the power generators are engrossed in developing new and cheaper forms of power generation, we are likely to find, not that energy becomes more expensive, but that it becomes cheaper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is any elasticity of demand for energy, carbon dioxide levels will not decrease but increase. If the energy is generated by roughly the same method, emissions will increase. That is why I asked the Minister what happened to carbon dioxide emissions in the past year. I am not surprised that he told me that in 1991 we produced about 1 per cent. more carbon dioxide than in 1990. That is at a time when manufacturing production has dropped by 2·5 per cent. and we are in a serious recession. Not even the Government now deny that, which is progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions are increasing even when the economy is slipping, and one adds that effect to the likely reduction in real terms in energy prices—they will hold steady, at least—once the British Coal tight contract ends in 1993, we will move into an era of rapid increases in carbon dioxide emissions unless something is done. If we add the nuclear levy to that, we will put a lot of pressure on the carbon-using part of the energy industry, which may cause difficulties in future. The emission of carbon dioxide will increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A carbon tax will pose a serious dilemma throughout Europe. If it is effective, everyone will scream blue murder. The Germans with their fast cars will not have it and the French who rely so heavily on nuclear industry will not have it. We will not have it for the very reasons that hon. Members have ennunciated today. If it is effective it will cost people money and affect their pockets and thus their behaviour. That is the whole purpose of it. That is why I asked if it would be fiscally neutral. It should be possible to design such a tax so that by influencing the income of individuals one would enable them to purchase whatever energy they wanted. The trouble is that a tax that is fiscally neutral introduces two different distortions and it would be extremely difficult to get the balance right. If the tax is not to be effective, it will be a mere token and will have no beneficial effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three or four major issues and it is a shame that in a short debate we cannot go into them in much detail. The first issue is that overall energy use is the key factor in carbon dioxide emissions and that is likely to increase. As we move out of recession into growth in Europe, there is every reason to believe that it will increase. That has to be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is the efficiency of generation and the pattern of usage. If my hon. Friends are serious about improving efficiency, why is not this country going in for combined heat and power in a big way? At what stage will
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
we make it illegal for any power generator to build a new plant that does not have combined heat and power? There are ample opportunities to do that. We are clearing derelict land—it is happening all over my constituency—and we are developing new business parks. It is possible to generate power in small units. Over the next few years, we should make it a requirement to push up the efficiency of energy generation from the 35 per cent. available from conventional power stations to the 70 per cent. available from CHP. I declare an interest: those turbines are made in my constituency in Derby and they are extremely good. The opportunities exist for British industry, which owns this technology, to make tremendous progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is the generation of power without carbon dioxide. That is why I put a question to my hon. Friend the Minister about business such as Rolls-Royce, which employs more than 1,000 top-class nuclear physicists and scientists in this country and has developed the technology for making power for submarines, for example. Most submarines, whether or not they carry nuclear warheads, are now powered by nuclear energy. Each of those robust power packs, which have a long, safe and effective history and which are designed for having people in close proximity and for leaving no trail, no track and no emissions, could produce enough energy for 15,000 houses. It would be feasible, within the relatively short time of about 10 years, to produce and design power packs in such a way that we should never need another Sizewell. By designing into those power packs their eventual destruction—putting them underground—it should be possible to generate nuclear power on a small scale with reduced risks and in an acceptable manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are serious about generating power without carbon dioxide, we must stop messing about. The Government support nuclear power and we should consider ways of generating power in future without having to go through the astonishing experience of Sizewell. I am convinced that that is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other matters have been touched on, such as the channel tunnel, which we really must get on with and finish. I am currently trying to persuade Toyota in my constituency to use rail instead of road. Rather than have, by the year 2000, about 300 car transporters a day on the roads, I should prefer three trainloads a day going out through the channel tunnel. However, that is not worth talking about yet because the channel tunnel is not even open. We could not get grants for the railheads because our roads do not count. They are not environmentally sensitive. Because of the wonderful efforts of the Department of Transport we have superb dual carriageways going through Derbyshire, so do not receive grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am speaking about long-term, important projects that have to be handled in such a way that businesses, such as Toyota, would not dream of using roads, but would automatically use the rail service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hayward 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend encourage the Department of Transport to consider banning the vast majority of private vehicles from the centre of London?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend tempts me—we could have a lot of fun with that if we were to design a proper transport policy for the year 2000.

rush hour traffic, so one really has to know people in high places to take one's car into the city at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) mentioned developing agricultural policies. The new midland forest is in my constituency and we are thrilled to bits about it. We are delighted to think that we shall cover thousands of acres with trees. However, the only part that seems to have been developed so far is the landscaping around Toyota, where one third of a million trees will be planted and shops built. With all due respect to everyone involved, including the Countryside Commision, which is terribly keen, we seem to have acquired more staff than trees. What my farmers want to know is how realistic policies to make that happen can be created. We want the best, we have argued for it, but we have not yet generated the structure and the finance to make it a reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must be realistic, too. It is not enough to fight off other countries' proposals. Unless we change our approach, CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions will rise at 1 or 2 per cent. a year, depending on the growth of the economy, and nothing will be achieved. The Labour amendment has no value. Labour and Liberal Democrat policy is contradictory. Deep mining cannot be subsidised at the level that those parties desire. Coal cannot be regarded as the premium fuel, nor can the value of nuclear be denied, yet both parties want to cut emissions faster than other countries. That just does not work and their amendment is a load of humbug.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the Ministers well in their endeavours. I wish them strength to their arms and I am sure that a determined pursuit of their policies will lead to success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.16 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we get this matter wrong, my children's children—and their descendents—will pay a very high price. It is depressing that the Minister should have given the Committee such a muddled and obfuscating line. He has intimated that the Commission has produced an exceedingly diffuse document, to which the Government have agreed, even though they have no clear view of what should be done if they find the final document unworkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reality, the Commission has a duty to produce workable legislation. The principle involved goes beyond energy use. Is the Commission to be allowed to impose centrally a tax that has not been agreed by member states? This is the first occasion on which the Commission has tried to assume powers that many people do not want to be exercised at a European level. Moreover, it is clear that many decisions are being rushed through because of the need to go to Brazil in June. That is a dangerous tactic, not least because it is important to have clear lines of agreement. All Community countries should be prepared to move at the same pace. Without such discipline, it will not be possible to persuade countries that use large amounts of energy, such as Japan and the United States—the—latter uses much low-cost energy—to go along with the European Commission's proposals. That is the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not discussed what the two proposed taxes would entail. What would a uniform energy tax involve? The Commission has stated that the net effect of such a tax would be a tax equivalent of $10 per barrel of oil by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
year 2000. The tax would be introduced at $3 a barrel in 1993, with yearly increments of $1 a barrel thereafter. The second tax would also have a direct effect on costs, but the argument is exceedingly muddled, as large industries that use a lot of energy would be able to apply for exemptions from the existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make up our minds about what we are trying to do. If we are to use the ineffective and uneven method of limiting energy use by means of a punitive tax, that tax must apply to all users of large amounts of energy. Or is this document merely a gesture for the relevant Commissioner to employ in global discussions, rather than a serious proposal? If so, that would be fine—we would not need to discuss it seriously. We would certainly not need to pretend that it was a positive recommendation for action on carbon dioxide emissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the document shows that the Commission is in a considerable muddle. I want urgent action. The Committee is not divided on that. If we were to act on the lines suggested, the Government would have to produce an estimate of the programme's cost-effectiveness and say what they would do with the taxes raised, how those changes would be neutral across the tax system and what incentives would be offered to industry and householders to change their habits and movements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence that the Government are prepared to tackle matters, such as transport, that could immediately affect the problem. If the Government were serious about encouraging the movement of, for example, freight from road to railways, they would not be talking, with extraordinary inelegance, of privatising British Rail. British Rail has enough difficulties with planning freight movements as a result of the channel tunnel without having the future so muddled that it is unable to plan two years ahead, let alone five, 10 or 15. The incentives that the Government could offer would have an immediate impact on the changes described by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie), if we were serious about wanting them.

We shall debate the matter a dozen times. It is sad that hon. Members do not think the matter sufficiently important to turn up in large numbers to debate the impact of a tax that has political, economic and environmental import for every aspect of our lives. The political cost of proceeding in the piecemeal, badly-researched and incompetent way proposed by the Commission would be high. I have not been reassured by the information that the Minister has given us that the Government have a clear view of what to do. If they were sure, he would have been able to describe in detail research and development and the cost of the proposals. The Government must produce a practical plan if they are serious about change. There is no evidence of such a plan. The proposals are ill-thought out and will cost us a great deal in the long run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Under-Secretary will reply to the debate. It is appropriate that I intervene because my ministerial responsibilities are relevant to the motion. I support the

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
motion and want to tell the Committee about some of the practical measures that my Department is taking to achieve our conditional goal of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2005.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To achieve that, we need a package of measures. Energy efficiency is the most important measure for my Department, but there will be an increasing contribution from renewable energy resources. We welcome some fuel switching, which will help us to attain the target. The contribution of nuclear power will also help because it generates energy with scarcely any gaseous emissions. In that context, some increase in the relative price of fuel may be appropriate, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie) observed that some European countries apparently subsidise carbon. It is argued that, before we tax carbon, we should reduce subsidies for it, and that we should try to create an energy market before we adopt additional fiscal measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Energy Efficiency Office in my Department has a budget of £42 million. It has increased steadily over the years and now stands eight times higher in real terms than the budget that we inherited in 1979. I am pleased to say that the budget for the Energy Efficiency Office will increase next year by about 40 per cent. Not many Government programmes receive such a real increase. The Energy Efficiency Office has several initiatives and I shall remind members of the Committee of some.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the environmental White Paper was published two years ago, we set up a ministerial group on energy efficiency, which is chaired by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy. The group has published an annual report that sets out many Government programmes. We also founded an extensive best practice programme, which seeks to introduce the best technology and fruits of research throughout industry. Opposition Members have already mentioned our home energy efficiency scheme. The so-called HEES scheme gives grants to low-income households to improve insulation, draught proofing and so on. The programme will be expanded—its budget will increase by 50 per cent. next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional efficiency offices are worth more than a mention, because they form a network throughout the country to provide help, advice and encouragement to those who seek to take energy efficiency measures in commerce and industry. We plan to reduce energy consumption on the Government estate by a further 15 per cent. over the next five years. It is not right to lecture other people about energy efficiency without reducing consumption in the buildings and on the estate that we own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last October, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State launched a campaign to persuade industry and commerce to instigate energy efficiency measures as part of its mainstream activities. The campaign is called "Making a Corporate Commitment" and about 130 companies have signed up to it. We are pleased with the response from industry, as it shows a practical example of the commitment of British industry as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not overlook the contribution that ordinary consumers can make in their homes. Many people are confused about environmental issues and the practical measures that they can take to help. We know that people worry about the ozone layer, acid rain and global warming, but they are often unsure what they can do. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
recently launched the Helping the Earth Begins at Home Campaign. It seeks to advise those who hope to make a personal contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also support labelling appliances. In a free society people make free choices, but those choices should be informed. Regional electricity companies have agreed to put energy efficiency labels on specific domestic appliances in their showrooms. That is in advance of a mandatory requirement that may form part of an EC directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister acquired the same co-operation from other establishments that sell such equipment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. It is not a single initiative, it is part of an overall programme. I mentioned the specific labels on fridges and freezers simply to illustrate that that was a start. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has already mentioned, we have a parallel initiative on the energy rating of houses to give similar advice to those seeking to buy, rent or move house. Energy efficiency labels should be confined to some domestic appliances, but should eventually spread to all electrical appliances and, if possible, in advance of compulsion by an EC directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall shortly launch an energy management assistance scheme to give financial assistance to small companies undertaking energy surveys and feasibility studies, and following up the results with implementation. Details will be announced shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to put on the record some of the renewable energy policies that we have been pursuing for some time. They fall under three headings. The first is research and development. The second is the guaranteed share of the electricity market that is being reserved for renewable energy sources—the so-called non-fossil fuel obligation. Two orders have been laid, which have quadrupled the capacity contracted to regional electricity companies since 1990. Finally, there is financial assistance by means of a levy—the fossil fule levy—which is paid to those renewable energy technologies in order to get them started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are committed to a review of the future of nuclear power in 1994. That will take full account of the environmental aspects of nuclear power, including the fact that, by emitting almost no gases into the atmosphere, it has a part to play in reducing the threat of global warming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot finish my remarks without alluding to the Opposition amendment. I note that there is no Opposition energy spokesman present. That may be significant, because the terms of the amendment are in flat contradiction of Opposition energy policies. The amendment was tabled by an environment spokesman—a point brought out by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was tabled only after I had discussed the matter with the energy team and it is fully in accord with the Labour party's policies on CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions, which environmentalists everywhere will welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear that. Perhaps I should spell out how the contradiction arises. It is Opposition policy to keep the coal industry at its present size. That has been stated more than once by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), who has also said that he will seek to deter the use of gas for electricity generation. We know that a degree of fuel
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
switching towards gas will help us to meet our CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> stabilisation target. The application of efficient combined-cycle gas turbine technology for energy generation will obtain more electricity for less carbon. The Labour party also believes in phasing out nuclear power. All that adds up to a package to increase carbon dioxide emissions. The Committee will not understand how Opposition Members can put their names to a target that seeks to stabilise the emissions by 2000 and make significant reductions thereafter. That is an advance on existing Labour party policy, which has not gone unnoticed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend confused the position further by opposing a carbon tax. I could understand the Labour party having policies that would increase carbon emissions by every other means, if it had a target for a ferocious energy tax to deter people from using it. The hon. Gentleman said that the Labour party supported "a small carbon levy" which would not seek to alter consumption or people's behaviour. Such a tax would not work; it would simply be a tax-raising mechanism. That proposal will be of interest to my colleagues in the more political parts of the party machine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I express my concern about the Minister's convoluted point about my comment. We are expressly against using a high energy/carbon tax to reduce consumption. Evidence shows that such a tax does not work. Will the Minister reflect on the evidence and say at what level he would set the energy/carbon tax to create reductions in CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point. We are trying to ascertain the level of tax that must be set significantly to alter people's behaviour. I agree that the hon. Gentleman has a fair point, but his party is in the weakest position to make it. If the Labour party opposes such a tax but wishes to phase out nuclear power, to stop gas-fired electricity generation and to maintain the present size of the coal industry, it is incredible that it has a target to stabilise CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions by the year 2,000 and reduce them thereafter. That is my point, which is in no sense diluted or contradicted by any of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment. We have a realistic, coherent and achievable set of policies. I urge my hon. Friends to support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all agreed that we want to reduce CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. We simply disagree on how and when we shall be able to do so. The first way is through environmentally sensitive products. The Government argue that if we are given the choice between a carrot and a stick, we shall choose the stick. Evidence shows, however, that a high energy tax policy has no direct correlation to a reduction in emissions. Such a tax hits the poorest people in society because they have to use a higher proportion of their income to pay the tax. We are arguing for a small carbon levy that would go into a special fund. We know what can and cannot be achieved by a high energy tax. A special fund could be used for research and development and other projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to the way in which plants, for environmental and aesthetic reasons, can improve the
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
environment. Many other matters require research. In Aberdeen, which is close to the heart of the Chairman, there is a distillery project. Jim MacColl, who is a well-known gardener on television in Scotland, has pioneered the use of waste heat from the distillery to grow tomatoes. Tomato growing is difficult in the north of Scotland because we do not have the natural climate for it, as does the Channel Islands. The opportunity for doing so is created by the distillery, which produces heat that is usually wasted. All the opportunities for engaging in similar projects, using incinerators and distilleries, mean plenty of scope for research, development and investment. If the EC's directive on incinerators and the disposal of sewage sludge is implemented, there will be more incinerators and waste heat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to Howdens, a company in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams). I stress that Howdens was a world market leader in renewable energy products. It hit a bad period during the Gulf war because of sanctions. As leader of the local council at the time, I was involved in discussions with Howdens, which did not think that it could bridge that bad period. We called on the Government to intervene because Howdens was working on renewable energy projects such as wind turbines and clean-coal technology, but they gave no assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the European Community's rules? The Community would take a very dim view of Government money going into commercial business. That is a problem which has afflicted us in developing our car industry. It is inconsistent for the Labour party to say, "We would accept everything coming from Brussels, including the Community's basic rules, and then, when it suits us we would ignore them."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of the rules referred to by the hon. Lady. But we are realistic; we were not flying kites when it came to Howdens. The company had a cogent plan, worked out with the work force and academics, in which the Government could accelerate existing projects—simply bring them forward a bit—and put up front money that would be spent anyway. That solution would not have meant any cost to the public purse—it would have been like a loan. The Government have certainly achieved cleaner air in Renfrew: Howdens emits no carbon dioxide now because the gates have closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very proud that when I was leader of Renfrew district council we won an annual award for our work on energy efficiency in the council. There is some information in the newspapers about a Property Services Agency study of the Palace of Westminster. For an investment of £446,920 it was estimated that there would be an annual saving of £217,320. A simple arithmetical exercise will tell us that there is a pay-back period of about two years, which is very short. However, if local authorities and other public agencies are to achieve that, they must have the money to invest initially. Local authorities have a problem about investing properly in energy saving because the money must be there to invest before there can be a pay back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very easy to talk about the insulation standards of new buildings, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) said, existing buildings, in which a great deal of energy is wasted because of practical problems, such as draughty windows, must also be considered. We must not simply have special
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
programmes and initiatives to deal with energy conservation; the issue must be considered in terms of overall Government policies. Local government finance measures should ensure that local authority housing does not have draughty windows so that energy is conserved. There would be a cost-effective benefit and an improvement in health if the growth of mould, which causes ill health, was prevented. Buildings would require less maintenance because they are better protected when they are heated properly. Most importantly, it would mean a better quality of life for the people in such housing many of whom are senior citizens or on low incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as part of the research that the Minister promised, is he willing to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of extending the programme of insulation of the homes of those on low incomes, taking into the equation savings on energy and savings to the Exchequer, which could be used for creating new jobs? I understand that it costs the Exchequer about £8,000 a year for every unemployed person, so any cost-benefit analysis of creating jobs in home insulation should take that factor into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. I thank those hon. Members who have contributed, in particular my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie), who made an extremely interesting and lucid speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Energy described his work in the Department. He was right to draw attention to the contradictions inherent in the amendment tabled by Opposition Members. Interestingly, until today I thought that the Labour party was proposing a small energy levy, but it has now been described as a small carbon levy. We deserve to know whether it is a small energy levy or a small carbon levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also wait with interest to know how much money such a levy would raise. As my hon. Friend said, this looks like another spending pledge. But it goes beyond that. If the Labour party's proposal is to have any hope of working, it must be possible to hypothecate that money raised through spending for energy efficiency. There has been no indication of whether the Labour party's Treasury team has been involved in presenting the idea that revenue from such a levy should be hypothecated specifically for spending on energy efficiency and renewables. Like my hon. Friend, I would not be surprised if neither the Labour party's energy team nor its Treasury team had been consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we can expect some mischief-making on this point. After all, that is partly what politics is about in a pre-election period. I made it clear that the energy team was specifically consulted about the proposal. Furthermore, we have had general discussions with our Treasury team about the environmental purposes, to which money raised in the environmental sphere will be put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In certain specific areas agreements have already been reached on how that will be done. As far as the energy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is an experienced Member. He should not respond too readily to baiting. I think that he has now answered the point about who consulted whom about what.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The epitaph on the Labour party's environmental proposals will be, "We had general discussions." No wonder the Environmental Data Services magazine 	<i>ENDS Report 204</i> concluded this month:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Environmentalists are already deeply concerned about the prospect of a Labour Government."</p></blockquote>
Having heard what has been said this morning, I am not surprised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summarising the debate, I wish to make it clear that the Government take the threat of climate change very seriously. We have a leading role in negotiations for a climate change convention. We have set a target, which is conditional on other countries taking similar action, because a worldwide response is required. Our White Paper set out the strategy for meeting that target and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Energy detailed some measures that we are taking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue today is the possible Community strategy as set out in the communication. It has three elements. The first is a national programme: we fully support the need for all member states to draw up national programmes. The second concerns specific measures at Community levels to promote energy efficiency, renewables and energy technology. We support those measures and shall discuss with the rest of the Community how to advance them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate today has concentrated largely on the Labour party's proposals for a carbon tax. They are the most difficult of issues and have perhaps skewed some of the debate. As the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) seems to have misunderstood, I reiterate that any tax proposals will be discussed by ECOFIN. Unanimity is needed for the imposition of new taxes, as is evident from the various changes to the VAT and excise systems that have been agreed in the run-up to the abolition of fiscal frontiers on 1 January of next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusions of the joint Energy Environment Council and ECOFIN in December represent helpful steps forward but, as today's debate has evidenced, there is a long way to go. Much more work needs to be done. We shall participate constructively in further discussions where our aim will be to ensure that any tax results in a fall in world emissions. Unless it contributes to a fall in world emissions, it would have no value. That is why negotiations on a framework convention are so important. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is going to Rio, where we hope to sign an effective climate convention.
