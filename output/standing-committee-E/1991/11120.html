European Community Documents Nos. 4173/91, 4174/91 and 4175/91 relating to Copyright, Lending Right, Rental Right and Accession of Member States to the Berne Convention</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Edward Leigh)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The motion arises out of an ambitious programme of work which the European Commission has embarked on regarding copyright.<br><br>
The Commission's programme forms part of its work towards the completion of the internal market. It wishes to ensure that those who create, produce and perform works of literature, art and music have the necessary legal rights to combat piracy of their works throughout the Community. It also seeks to harmonise those rights, where necessary, to ensure fair competition in the supply of goods and services that are protected by copyright.<br><br>
The Government fully support those objectives. The United Kingdom is in the fortunate position of having many talented authors, artists, composers and performing artists whose work is in great demand throughout Europe. However, they do not enjoy the protection in all countries of the Community that our domestic law provides. We therefore broadly welcome the Commission's Initiatives and intend to play a constructive part in negotiations about them. We do, however, recognise that copyright law must balance the rights of copyright owners and performers with the needs of society as a whole. Furthermore, not all aspects of copyright are relevant to the workings of the internal market, and we shall examine the Commission's proposals carefully to ensure that they do not extend into areas which should properly remain within the competence of member states.<br><br>
Document 4173/9 sets out the Commission's working programme about copyright and so-called neighbouring rights. I should perhaps explain that there are differences between member states about what those expressions cover. In the United Kingdom copyright protects literary works, musical and artistic works, films, sound recordings, and broadcasts. Performers' rights are protected separately as a neighbouring right. However, in several other countries, sound recordings and broadcasts fall within neighbouring rights rather than copyright. The point should not cause any substantive difficulties in the negotiations nor will it, I trust, in this debate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The working programme is, as I have said, ambitious. It envisages proposals for legislative action in six areas this year, and a programme of studies and other actions is to be completed by the end of 1992. Two of the legislative proposals have already been made and are part of the subject matter of our debate. Of the remaining four proposals, the Government welcome the Commission's intention to harmonise the term of protection for copyright and certain neighbouring rights. We feel that there is a particular need to ensure that sound recordings are protected in all countries of the Community for 50 years, as in the United Kingdom. We also accept that there are some uncertainties at the European level about the rules concerning copyright and neighbouring rights applicable to satellite and cable broadcasting and we therefore support Community action about that.<br><br>
We are, however, less persuaded that action is necessary in respect of the home copying of sound and audiovisual recordings, and shall therefore closely consider any Commission proposals about that. We look forward to the results of the studies which the Commission intends to carry out regarding moral rights, photocopying, resale rights and collective management of copyright and neighbouring rights.<br><br>
The Second Document, 4174/91, is a proposal for a Council decision, which would require all member states to accede to and comply with the Berne copyright convention and the Rome convention on neighbouring rights. The Commission sees this as providing a basic level of harmonisation on which it will be possible to build in the future. I have to say, however, that the Government have some doubts about whether the proposal is necessary or desirable. The United Kingdom already complies with that decision. Indeed, all but two member states, Belgium and Ireland, have acceded to the latest text of the Berne convention, and those which have not belong to earlier texts of that convention. The degree of copyright harmonisation which would result from that decision is therefore very small. Admittedly, greater harmonisation of neighbouring rights would result, because five member states have yet to accede to the Rome convention. However, wide differences would remain because the Convention contains many provisions that are discretionary or may be reserved.<br><br>
Furthermore, we and other member states have yet to be satisfied that the treaty base cited by the Commission is adequate for a decision which would affect member states' external treaty relations with third countries and would result in a substantial transfer of competence from the member states to the Community. We are continuing to examine those questions and await an opinion from the legal services of the Council and a response from the Commission to the questions that have been raised in discussions, in a Council working group.<br><br>
Document 4175/91 is a proposed directive that would require member states to confer on authors, performers and producers of films and sound recordings an exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the commercial rental or the public lending of their works. Member states would, however, be allowed to have public lending right schemes, such as in the United
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0280">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Kingdom, in respect of book lending from public libraries, rather than exclusive rights, provided that authors are equitably remunerated. The directive also proposes exclusive rights for performers, producers of films and sound recordings and broadcasting organisations in respect of the reproduction and distribution of their works.<br><br>
There is much in the draft directive that we support. The Government recently legislated, in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, to introduce an exclusive rental right in respect of films, sound recordings and computer programmes in recognition of the fact that rights owners need to be able to control that activity, partly to ensure proper remuneration and partly to help to minimise the unauthorised copying of borrowed material. We feel that such control should be available throughout the Community. Authors throughout the Community should be remunerated in respect of public library lending and that performers, broadcasters and record producers need Community-wide reproduction and distribution rights.<br><br>
However, we question the need for the directive to create rental rights in respect of other works, such as works of art, because we doubt that problems in that area need action at Community level. Nor are we persuaded that it is necessary or desirable to create a separate rental right for each performer, author, composer or artist who contributes to the production of a record or film. That multiplicity of rights could result, for example, in video rental outlets requiring licences from several different categories of rights owners, each possibly subject to different licence conditions and methods of payment. We shall continue to make our doubts known to the Commission and other member states.<br><br>
Questions of legal base and competence also arise in connection with the draft directive. In particular, it is not clear whether the cited treaty provisions justify the inclusion of Article 3 of the proposed directive, which is intended to assure authors and performing artists an adequate share of income from rental. The practical effect of such a measure is of some concern, because a potentially large number of authors and performers would apparently acquire the right to challenge contractual provisions that they had freely entered into. That could be particularly troublesome in the case of session musicians or film extras who are normally paid a single lump sum for their services at the time that a record or film is made and well before any rental income has accrued. Again, we are discussing our worries within the Council and are carrying out a thorough analysis of the legal basis for certain of the directive's provisions.<br><br>
I recognise that these matters are somewhat complex, but I hope that I have given the Committee a clear idea of the content of the Commission's proposals and of the Government's general attitude towards them. I shall be happy to deal with any specific points that members of the Committee may raise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to questions. Members of the Committee should ensure that they ask questions.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the rare delights of a Wednesday morning is to attend a European Standing Committee, especially when it is discussing copyright, which is impenetratable enough without our having to read European Community documents on the subject.<br><br>
I join the Minister in welcoming the initiative, but is he satisfied that the balance of rights between owners and the public is being met by the documents, or will he look for further amendments as the directives proceed? Is the timetable, which expects the directive to be in place by the end of 1992, realistic, or are we likely to see a slippage in the programme?<br><br>
The Minister mentioned the balance of concern between the Commission and member states about provisions for control of copyright. Can he elaborate further and perhaps tease out some of the aspects on which he expects the national interest to be paramount?<br><br>
Regarding the 50-year term for recording copyright, which we support, is the Minister aware of the potential challenge to this from other member states, and is a defence of it likely to be difficult? Can he say what "moral right" is? I am no expert on copyright.<br><br>
As to the balance of rights and the right of owners to forbid rental of a product, I accept entirely what the Minister says about the potential for a multiplicity of rights to be granted. Is there provision for a licence of right? Are users, provided that they pay the appropriate fee, entitled to a licence for rental, or can it be absolutely forbidden?<br><br>
What is the attitude of other member states to the distinction that has been brought to our attention by the Library Association between lending rights and rental rights? I understand that in the EC it is not general practice to make this distinction. What will be the attitude of other member states to our insistence on maintaining lending rights and to our recognition of the importance of public lending rights as part of the national interest?<br><br>
During Committee debates on the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Bill, the subject of the blank tape levy was aired at great length, but I notice that the Minister did not refer to it—or if he did, it escaped my attention. I have doubts about the advisability of imposing a blank tape levy, expecially with the increasing use of digital media for recording, such as discs, and the new digital audio format for tapes, where one can encript data and make it impossible for a recording to be taken from it. I accept that there are grey areas here.<br><br>
If, as seems likely, the EC is planning to issue a directive insisting on a levy, what will be the Government's attitude? What work has been done to prepare for it, if it comes? What will the levy be used for? Has this been thought about?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer as many of the hon. Gentleman's questions as I can.<br><br>
The issue of compensating copyright owners for home taping is probably the one that most concerns the public. In what is a most technical area, the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0281">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
Gentleman mentioned the importance of balancing the needs of the public against those of copyright owners. I suspect that what concerns people most is whether copyright owners should be compensated for the enormous amount of home copying that takes place. We know that most people buy only blank tapes on which to copy. Perhaps that is not entirely true: blind people use a lot of blank tapes as a form of notepaper.<br><br>
This is a fascinating debate. Discussion is taking place within the Labour party. I am pleased that the Government are also debating these matters. The judgment is finely balanced. On one side of the argument are the struggling artists—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Beatles and the Rolling Stones.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not all artists are Beatles or Rolling Stones. They should be compensated for the considerable amount of taping that takes place. The other side of the argument is whether it is right to impose a general tax on the manufacturers of the tapes—a tax on which the public would have no say. Representations have come from, in particular, societies that represent blind people, who often have limited incomes. They argue that if there were say, a 10 per cent levy on all blank tapes to recompense copyright owners, it could cost blind people a considerable sum of money.<br><br>
This issue was debated at length during the passage of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. No doubt there still be further debates here. The Government are interested in the Committee's views, because opinion is finely balanced. When the Bill was going through the House, the Government felt that there were insufficient grounds for imposing a tax on the public to enforce these private rights. We said then that it would involve considerable rough justice, as many people used blank tapes in ways that did not infringe copyright. I have spoken about blind people and other handicapped groups.<br><br>
We decided that a considerable proportion of levy income would in any event be lost from the rights that authors are given to ensure an economic return for their work, because of administrative costs, and so on.<br><br>
I hope that I have outlined fairly both sides of the argument. If hon. Members have strong views either way, I hope that they will let us know. These working documents are discussed at Community level and the Commitee's views will be useful.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the Government's concern about legal basis and competence. We have doubts about the use of articles 57(2) and 66, which relate to the co-ordination of provisions for the taking up and pursuit of activities by self-employed persons. On the face of it, these are applicable only to measures relating to rights of establishments, not to measure creating rights that might make certain activities more remunerative.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked what "moral rights" were. The 1988 legislation introduced certain moral rights into United Kingdom law for the first time. They give authors, artists, composers and film directors the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
means to ensure that their work is publicly attibuted to them and not distorted in ways that would be harmful to their reputation. They are personal rights—quite distinct from the rights given to authors to ensure an ecomonic return from their work. Therefore, they are not appropriate subject matter for action under the internal market programme.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about opinion on lending and rental rights in other member states. Opinion there is divided. Schemes for remunerating authors for lending from public libraries exist in only four member states—the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. There is therefore an understandable fear of the unknown in many other Community states. We shall endeavour to persuade them that such schemes are right in principle and can be administered efficiently and economically. We shall be happy to share with any member state information gained from our experience of administering public lending rights.<br><br>
I began by giving our views on home taping. The Committee may be especially interested in the subject of public lending rights, which is of great concern to the public and to authors. They were pleased with the way in which the scheme was being administered. Public lending right throughout the Community is of particular interest to us because British authors are popular on the continent. Many books in the average Danish public library, for instance, are written by English authors. At the moment there is no way in which those English authors can be recompensed.<br><br>
On the other side of the coin, of course, it is fair to say that not many books in English libraries aree written by Danish authors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In Danish?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In English. That is a problem. We would benefit from a Community-wide scheme that introduced the concept of public lending right throughout the Community, as we have introduced in in this country. As we dominate this field, we could only benefit from that.<br><br>
I was asked about the timetable. All I can say is that it is possibly achievable—to use the words of the briefing that I have received from my officials. I am unsure what that means; it sounds like Eurospeak to me. However, we know that these things take time and we must leave it at that. It is in our interests to achieve harmonisation of copyright throughout the Community.<br><br>
On sound recordings, we are the No. 1 industry in Europe and that also applies to publishing. In fact, after America, we are the No. 1 industry in the world in both of those industries. That shows our interest in these matters and why we broadly support the work of the Community on them. It can only be to our benefit for there to be harmonisation of copyright.<br><br>
The Berne convention protects authors extremely well. Apart from the rather narrow legalistic competence arguments, which are not of general concern to the public but more to Governments and Parliaments, in broad terms we can outline our views in this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0282">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
way. We accept these documents, we want to work constructively on them and we shall benefit from harmonisation.<br><br>
I was asked about the balance of rights. Further work needs to be done on video rentals. Generally, the simple point to get over is that we probably have the balance of rights about right for authors, but video rentals are much more complex because of the involvement of producers and performing artists, which makes it more difficult to achieve a true balance of rights.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me about rights in other member states, which is a complex issue. For example, there are no broadcasting rights for record producers in some member states, such as Greece. The hon. Gentleman also asked about the 50-year term for our protection of sound recordings and we are optimistic about achieving that in all member states. Clearly, as we already have that in our country we are anxious for it to apply in all other countries.<br><br>
I may have missed out one or two questions, and if I have I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps there may be an opportunity later to answer other questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister stated that there is an advantage to this country in greater harminisation in the authors' lending right and copyright protection. Has his Department made any efforts to quantify the financial flows that will be established by the implementation of the Commission's two proposals on copyright and enabling right and on the establishment of a rental right? If so, what will be the net position to this country on the basis of such projections?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister said that if the Committee's proposal for all member states to ratify both the Berne and the Rome conventions were adopted it would not be effective in achieving full harmonisation. Is he suggesting that as that proposal is inadequate the Commission should go further and produce another directive which would have the effect of completing harmonisation and tidying up the losse ends left by the ratification of those two conventions? I am unclear whether my hon. Friend concluded that from his statement about the inadequacy of the two conventions.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend give a brief summary of the position in the United States—the other large, single or internal market in the world—with regard to intellectual property and how that differs from the present regime in the Community and the one that will be established if these proposals are accepted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that, although I have checked, we do not have an answer and neither does the Commission on the flows of money that are involved and how this country would benefit. I can only express myself in very broad terms. As I said in answering the previous question, because we have the largest publishing and sound recording industry in Europe—the largest in the world after America—presumably it follows that we must benefit from any harmonisation. Considerable protection for authors already exists but that is more complicated in sound recording. To quote one practical example, if a sound
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
recording is made and broadcast in Spain, because of the shortcomings of the Rome convention there is no compensation. That shows that although I cannot give a direct answer because nobody has the figures, we must benefit from any general harmonisation.<br><br>
My hon. Friend asked about our concerns regarding the Rome and Berne conventions. The Berne convention is well established. It has developed over the years and all member states subscribe to it. Only two countries have not subscribed to the latest working document of the Berne convention. In fact, those two countries subscribed to the earliest conventions and we do not see a problem. We are worried because the Rome and Berne conventions also involve our relations with external partners and the Commission acquiring competence. We are saying that it should move first to harmonise matters within the Community and that it is not necessary to proceed by requiring all member states to join the latest working documents of the Berne convention.—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Unfortunately, my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) has had to leave the Committee Room to vote elsewhere. He can read my answer to his question in <i>Hansard,</i> which I am sure he will find interesting. United States law is broadly in line with that in the United Kingdom. However, we give greater rights to producers of sound recordings and performers than the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. We have just seen an unusual circumstance that has not afflicted a Committee of this sort before. Would it not be sensible, if an hon. Member is called away for a Division—that will occur more in the spring when there are many Committees sitting—for the reply to his question, especially from a Minister, to be held over? Is it possible to raise that point with the Speaker's Panel?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. Would it not be better to consider such matters after this last 32 minutes of questions? Otherwise, we shall start considering what will happen if an hon. Member has a heart attack, feels ill, wants to go to the loo, and so on. Surely it is far better for us to carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bosworth (Mr. Tredinnick) raised an interesting point of order. I shall have a word with the Chairman of Ways and Means. That is the best approach, not least because we are still very flexible about how we handle these Committees. However, I am afraid that hon. Members escaping from Committees to vote in other Committees is a common practice. Back Bench Members, especially on the Government Benches, seem to be dragooned on to several Committees by those people known affectionately as the Whips. As a former Deputy Chief Whip, I know just how awful and terrible they are. However, the point has some validity and I shall draw it to the attention of the Chairman of Ways and Means at the first opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome much of what was said this morning, especially the Minister's acknowledgement
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0283">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
of the potentially great advantages of this legislation for those people in the British Isles—they are not all English—who work in the English language. The process of cultural colonisation in virtually every corner of the planet means that everywhere one goes one finds that tapes and videos in the English language are played.<br><br>
I sympathise with the Minister about the complexities of applying the regulations to videos. I think of a video as complex as the recent Michael Jackson video; a large proportion of the state of Nevada would have an interest in the copyright for appearing in the video; in addition, there are also those who produced it.<br><br>
On the other hand, there are also very simple videos. Perhaps the simplest of all would be one of a late night Adjournment debate in this House for which there would be less popular demand. There are videos of such simplicity.<br><br>
The Minister is excessively cautious in suggesting that the trade cannnot cope with such complexity. There is already a discography database which notes all the commercial music recorded in the United Kingdom. It is a highly sophisticated system. Many of the sound recordings are also highly complex: Producers, composers and all kinds of people may have an interest in them. The music business, the copyrighters, already cope very successfully with that aspect.<br><br>
The Minister perhaps underestimates the sophistication of modern techniques to handle a system of such complexity. He should not be quite so cautious; he should be bolder when rich opportunities are available for British producers and creators.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may respond by referring to how authors and performing artists in this country can get a proper share of the rental income. Rental income derives, in the main, from the renting out of videos. Videos can incorporate copyright works and performances only with the consent of the author or performer. When giving that consent, the author or performer is able to make appropriate contractual provisions for a share of the rental income. That arrangement ensures that retail outlets are not subjected to the burden of multiple licensing. That is how the present system works in this country.<br><br>
I do not doubt the complexity and sophistication of the industry and its ability to cope with any degree of harmonisation. However, the United Kingdom seems to have hit upon a system which, although it might contain an element of rough justice, does compensate the producer; he, of course, is involved with the original performer and the other makers of the video. If a more complex form of remuneration were introduced, which sought to unravel that relationship and compensate all the individuals, it could cause difficulties. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that because of its sophistication the industry probably could cope with that, but I doubt whether that would benefit the consider, in terms of reduced costs.<br><br>
One must balance the desire to compensate not only producers of videos but those who perform in them, or help in their creation, and also the desire to have a sophisticated system of the type described by the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Gentleman with the obvious desire that all Members of Parliament have to ensure that the consumer is given as wide a choice as possible as cheaply as possible. It is a difficult balance to achieve. I should have thought that the way that we do things in this country is broadly correct. But we are in a constructive relationship with our Europen partners. If they can convince us that there is a better approach, we shall certainly be open to ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Peter Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask my hon. Friend the Minister three specific questions about the film industry. How is a film's producer covered for copyright potection? How does it apply to the first fixation—another aspect of the copyright? If there are participation rights in the production, how are they protected? Do they apply only to those who are defined, such as film stars, or do they extend to electricians and others? I am sorry if these are technical questions, but that is what our question period is about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I have already dealt with those points, although my hon. Friend has raised them in a technical way. The broad answer is that producers are covered under the United Kingdom system, but others, such as performing artists, extras and lighting technicians are not. If I have not given my hon. Friend a satisfactory answer, we could correspond later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This Morning, more Opposition Members—and Welsh nationalists—have risen than usual. I shall take two questions from Conservative Members and one from the Opposition to balance the position. I do not want to hear any points of order about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Waller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister deal with the question of copying audio material—home taping? There is a problem. The Commission is considering the crucial issue of digitial copying of digital material, where there is an exact replica of the quality of the original. The right approach is being adopted to prevent further copies from a copy.<br><br>
Has my hon. Friend the Minister seen a recent survey on home taping, which showed that the producer of the material does not face a great loss? Much copying is done from a record, for example, and put on to a tape for use in the car. The majority of people who acquire copies from someone who bought the original state that they would not have bought the original record or tape of that material. Although it is a common practice, therefore, home taping might not be a great loss to producers. However, we should not discount the problem altogether. Recent surveys suggest that home taping is done in a way that justifies the Government's decision not to impose a levy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a very interesting point. My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley has adduced exactly the argument that led us not to impose a levy: it would be a burden on home copiers and might not save producers very much. It is difficult to reach a definitive
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0284">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
conclusion. We cannot know exactly what goes on in the minds of home tapers, nor how much loss accrues to the industry. It is a question of judgment. My hon. Friend has put the argument with characteristic skill. Others may have a different view, but my hon. Friend will know that, as a Government, we generally try to satisfy the needs of consumers.<br><br>
My hon. Friend asked about digital recording. The Commission is considering both analogue and digital copying. Estimates of loss vary, but we accept that not all copying displaces a sale. My hon. Friend made a fair point and we shall bear it in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to comment on a matter arising from a point made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) on the balance between the rights of owners and users. I have heard that within the advisory group which advises the Commission and the Council, the balance is very much in favour of the owners of rights rather than the users. Will the Minister confirm or deny that? If it is true, will he say how the balance could be redressed?<br><br>
On the distinction between lending and rental rights, I am concerned about the position of public libraries. They should not be considered to be commercial renters in the way that some other organisations are. Perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee how the distinction between lending and rental rights will be implemented.<br><br>
I was amazed to see, when reading some of the debates that have taken place in the House on this subject, that the Government had proposed that people who had made video copies of programmes would have to obliterate the copies after 28 days. A Labour Member at the time said that the only way of enforcing that would be to have exploding tapes which destroyed themselves after 28 days. It would be almost impossible to police such a provision. Will the Minister assure us that there is no likelihood of such a proposal being made during the current negotiations between EC countries?<br><br>
Perhaps I should not be so rash as to challenge your ruling, Mr. Hogg, but it might be sensible for us to alternate questions until one side has exhausted its line of questioning, when it would be possible for any other hon. Members who wish to ask questions to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be fair and to give all hon. Members an opportunity to ask at least one question. I have been a member of the Chairman's Panel for some years and, like exploding tapes, exhaustible Members of Parliament have not yet been invented.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asked about balance. We believe that the directive is broadly in line with existing United Kingdom law. The balance may not be perfect, but it is broadly in line with what she wants.<br><br>
The hon. Lady referred to public lending rights. I can comment only in general terms and I have already alluded to our difficulties. We are proud of leading Europe in instituting the system of public lending rights, but we must ensure that the public lending rights
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
of authors are not affected or lessened by the directive. We must ensure that those rights, aside from the copyright aspects, are ring-fenced. We understand that the directive will ensure that and that the public lending rights will continue. Only four countries have public lending rights and there may be much argument as the directive takes shape.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Lady that we shall try to ensure that our system of public lending rights is imposed on the Community, although I cannot promise that we shall achieve that. It is not usual to state in Committee the negotiating position of member states. Such matters are fluid and it may not be in our interest to do so. We want to build up qualified majorities to get our own way, or to build up qualified minorities to defeat proposals that we do not like. Other countries do not have our sophisticated system and we may have a hard slog to achieve all that we want on the protection of libraries. One argument is whether school libraries should be covered because costs would be imposed on them. We are not convinced that they should be. We hope that we can achieve a fair amount of protection through negotiation.<br><br>
A problem arises from an imbalance of trade. English is a world cultural language in a way that, sadly, not all European languages are. We stand to benefit much more than other countries from a European-wide public lending right. I have referred to the Danes and the Committee will be aware of the many famous authors from Belgium whose books we obtain from public libraries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Name one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That shows the difficulties under which we are labouring.<br><br>
We shall try to protect our system and to extend it throughout the Community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be wise if I declare a potential interest. I am a television script reader and under neighbouring rights, playing the signature tune of "Match of the Day" on my flute for "Children in Need" would probably entitle me to gain under the directive.<br><br>
Does my hon. Friend recognise that it will not be possible to explain all the serious issues that have been raised in representations from organisations such as The Library Association, the Music Copyright Reform Group, the Home Taping Rights Campaign and the Independent Television Association in an hour. Will he assure the Committee that he will consider the representations and reply in detail so that it is clear to those who made the representations—and to members of the Committee by putting copies of the replies in Library—which points the Government agree with, which ones they disagree with and which ones the European Community appears to disagree with. That will begin to expose some of the issues.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend also tell the Committee whether he will have detailed discussions with those who have a legitimate and broad interest—for example, The Library Association and the music organisations? If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0285">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
there is a general welcome for the directive, and if the details are fully understood, even when there are conflicts of interest, that will help our contribution in the Community and help us to get some of the right answers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley). The answer to both questions is yes.<br><br>
I am afraid that I cannot reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Honiton (Sir P. Emery). We do not understand the first fixation question, I apologise to my hon. Friend that I cannot give him an answer now, but I shall try to obtain one. It is obviously important that in such complex matters we have the widest possible consultation with all interested parties, and we shall do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to hear of the Government's concern about the needs of blind and disabled people.<br><br>
I refer the Minister to page viii of the 18th report from the Select Committee on European Legislation. Under the heading "Competence" it states that the Committee's view, vis-a-vis the Minister's explanatory memorandum is that if the decision were adopted it
<br><blockquote><p>"would have the effect of conceding to the Community competence for Convention matters both at the international level and within the Community."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"the effect of requiring compliance with the Conventions could be to empower the Commission to police national laws for compliance and … by the back door to give the European Court of Justice jurisdiction in relation to the Conventions."</p></blockquote>
That paragraph continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"doubt would be cast on the capacity of Member States to act in the administrative organs of the Conventions".</p></blockquote>
In other words, in terms of subsidiarity, the decision will deprive national Parliaments of any decision-making powers that they have over the implementation of the convention, or even to make changes to it. The concept of subsidiarity is worthless. Yet again the Commission is taking on formidable powers to intervene, which is a matter of deep concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for putting the point so forcefully. Whenever I attend the Council of Ministers—and I attended an informal meeting earlier this week—I constantly refer back to the need for subsidiarity. The principle of subsidiarity is the key to the whole European debate. When action can be carried out better at nation state level, it should be carried out in that way. I am also grateful to the hon. Gentleman for focusing our attention on the issue of competence. Clearly, adoption of the proposal would result in a substantial transfer of competence from member states to the Community.<br><br>
The European Court of Justice, for example, would require jurisdiction in interpreting the provisions of the Berne and Rome conventions, even though the conventions do not give the court such a role. Precisely what effect the decision would have on the freedom of member states to act, on the administrative organs of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
the convention and on negotiations concerning future international agreement in these areas is as yet unclear.<br><br>
That is the detailed answer, but I am grateful to the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow for raising the issue. We shall refer the matter from the Scrutiny Committee to the court and strongly urge our case. Is there a legal basis for the Commission interfering in this area? As we know, the Community is often a process. The most important article is article 100A on the single market. I am the consumer affairs Minister. In theory at least, the Community has no competence over my work, as there is no legal base for consumer affairs in the European Community, yet in practice the Commission uses article 100A to engage its interest in virtually all aspects of consumer affairs.<br><br>
The Committee may remember that we talked about unfair terms and consumer contracts at our previous meeting. There will be an enormous impact on our contract law. The Commission is effectively grounding its work on article 100A. The arguments adduced for the first time in Committee by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow are very important. They are not just narrow points of interest solely to lawyers. The issue of the Commission's competence to engage with conventions could go far wider. I do not pretend to be an expert international lawyer, but I presume that a precedent could be set for many other conventions that member states sign, which would clearly affect our relations with third countries outside the Community. Thus we shall argue hard on the important issues that the hon. Gentleman raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Favell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) has put his finger on a crucial point. Can the Minister explain why it is seen to be in the interest of the British people to proceed with harmonisation? We speak English here. All our trade in tapes is with the United States and other English-speaking countries. It is with them that we should be reaching agreement, not with continental countries.<br><br>
My children, who are aged 20 and 18, have hundreds of tapes that they used to record radio programmes. I bet that not more than 5 per cent of those tapes came from continental countries; probably 80 per cent came from the United States and 15 per cent from this country. Why should we give up our rights to negotiate with other English-speaking people?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point, but I cannot agree with my hon. Friend. There is an enormous trade in English-language sound recordings in Europe because they speak a great deal of English and enjoy our sound recordings. My hon. Friend is wrong. Our sound recordists are suffering from the fact that copyright law is not clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Favell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are collecting royalties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No; the money should trickle down to the producer, but it does not do so at present. I mentioned earlier a sound recording that was broadcast on Madrid radio; there was no means of recompensating that programme's producer. That would be possible if such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0286">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
matters were harmonised in the Community, and it is in our interests to do so. However, it is not necessary to proceed by means of the Berne and Rome conventions, which deal perfectly adequately with copyright relations with the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) about the compentence of the Commission to deal with changes from the Berne and Rome conventions.<br><br>
I have a simple question regarding the policing of the directives, should they be accepted. It has been said time and again that copyrighting is a tremendously complex subject. What chance is there of producing an effective policing system if the directives are accepted? I do not dispute the benefits of harmonisation throughout the Community, but could we police it effectively?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because private rights will be involved, it will be for producers to insist on the enforcement of their rights in their own country. However, if the directive is accepted, the Commission will have a general policing role to ensure that all countries abide by the directive and that producers will be compensated adequately. That would help them, because at present there is no common, easily-understood regime that protects their rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have one question for the Minister about rental rights. The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 gives a rental right to producers of sound recordings, films and computer programmes. However, no rental right is given to authors or composers in the Act. For example, record producers are free to distribute their sound recordings to rental outlets without the consent of the creators of works that are included in those recordings. There is no statutory obligation to remunerate creators for the rental of their recorded works. Should not authors and composers be protected?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rental income derives, in the main, from the renting of videos, which can only incorporate copyright works and performances with the consent of the author or performer. In giving their consent, the author or performer is able to make appropriate contractual provisions for shared rental income. That arrangement ensures that retail outlets cannot be subjected to the burden of multiple licensing, which I mentioned in my opening speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may return to the Minister's comments on the question that I asked him, will he urge upon ministerial colleagues at the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office the need to watch over the European Commission's eager desire to give to the European Community the role of signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not empowered to comment on the Government's behalf on that convention, but I shall bring the hon. Gentleman's point to the attention of my colleagues.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. If there is no agreement in the Council of Ministers in the coming month or two, and if there are changes to the draft directive that will probably be agreed, are the Government likely to put another memorandum before the Scrutiny Committee? Will it be in order, in those circumstances, to have a second debate on the same subject in Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is one of the most experienced Members of the House, having been a Minister, so he knows that that is not a matter for me. I cannot answer his point of order. The Minister has heard the hon. Gentleman—so, who knows? His prayers might be answered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of order, Mr. Hogg. This is a matter for Chairmen of Committees. It follows the point made by the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin). The Chairman has done well to have heard each hon. Member before 11.30 am, after a slow start: this has been a great achievement and we are grateful.<br><br>
A problem of balance has been anticipated. I air the issue only in order to say that if it becomes easy to pack the Committee and get more of us on to controversial issues, that may be an undesirable development. On the ground of fairness, the Chairmen may wish to consult and consider the issues without challenging what has happened this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Each time there is a sitting of the Committee, and each time I have the privilege of chairing it, it is apparent that we are still finding our way. It occurred to me this morning that the Committee sits down as sides but behaves like a Select Committee, which is a little unusual. The Chairmen's Panel constantly reviews the question of how to deal with this issue. I shall take that on board and discuss it with the Chairman of Ways and Means, so that when the Chairmen's Panel next meets I remember it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Peter Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. May I remind you and the Committee that the Procedure Committee is currently considering the problems and that what has taken place today will be reported to it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I keep forgetting the Procedure Committee. One tends to remember Committees on which one has served but not others. This matter is being looked at by the Procedure Committee as well as by the Chairmen's Panel. I hope that in the end we get it right. There is considerable interest in both European Committees, as well as a great deal of participation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I should like to know when the Procedure Committee is to report.<br><br>
Speaking on behalf of the Committee, may I point out that members of the public and officials have complained to me about the coldness of the Room. As I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0287">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
have a slight cold I intend leaving immediately after your response. It is all very well your pulling a face, Mr. Hogg, but I find the temperature too low for my comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am suffering from a cold. I blame the House of Commons for each cold I get because the House is the place to catch them. If the temperature is too low—I have not noticed it—I am sure that the people responsible will have heard the hon. Gentleman and that the matter will be resolved. I never feel the cold because I come from Aberdeen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. While addressing the great matters just raised, you may not have noticed that the windows are open. Surely it is within the Committee's powers to rectify that immediately?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be a European Community directive on the matter.</span></p>
<p>11.34 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 4173/91 relating to copyright and neighbouring rights, 4174/91 relating to accession to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations and 4175/91 relating to rental right, lending right and certain rights related to copyright; and supports the Government's intention to seek adequate protection for copyright owners and performing artists throughout the European Community while having regard to the needs of users of copyright works and of the services of the performers.</p></blockquote>
I do not intend to make a speech now because all the issues have been dealt with at length. We agree that we want to fight piracy. There have been worries about the Berne Convention and the legal implications, as well as about the number of rights owners who would be able to exercise control over the rental of videos and other such works. Those are the two main issues to come from the questions and answers, along with the matter of home taping. I shall be interested in hearing further comments.</span></p>
<p>11.35 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given full and open answers to the points raised that he was able to answer. I await with interest his reply on the first fixation.<br><br>
These are ambitious legislative proposals. It must be recognised that the European Community is embarking upon this programme while trying to achieve harmonisation in other areas in a short time. I have considerable doubts about whether harmonisation can be achieved within the allotted time-scale. We have set ourselves a difficult task. Considerable differences remain between member states on some of the more contentious issues.<br><br>
We welcome the initiative and the Government's general acceptance of the principles. We look forward to further discussions.<br><br>
Several important points still cause concern. Subsidiarity, in particular, is a legitimate issue. Hon. Mem-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
bers on both sides of the Committee have raised it. No doubt the Minister will look closely at it during any negotiations. I expect him to defend vigorously any area where our rights are greater than those of other European countries. We should vigorously oppose any dilution of rights here, especially on lending and the 50-year copyright.<br><br>
The balance between owners and users has to be respected, properly thought out and legislated for. The harmonisation programme has taken so long, and is likely to take so much more time over the coming period, that surely it is essential to get it right now so that we do not need to return to it immediately, on account of having missed some glaring deficiency.</span></p>
<p>11.37 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. Hogg, and to the Committee for my discourtesy in rushing out in the middle of the interesting replies to my earlier question. You understand, Mr. Hogg, how that can happen here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend did not hear my answer to his question. United States law is broadly in line with United Kingdom law, but we give greater rights to producers of sound recordings and performers than does the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I intended to look at <i>Hansard.</i><br><br>
The Minister has been clear and persuasive. The whole area of intellectual property, especially authors' lending rights, is one where this country has a considerable interest—indeed, a special interest in achieving greater harmonisation within the Community. Although we cannot quantify it, numbers could be substantial.<br><br>
My hon. Friend mentioned Denmark and Belgium. Others in the Community will, by the same token, be losers as a result of the proposals. The Minister will therefore have a hard fight, but the cause is worth while. I hope that, after this morning's proceedings, he realises that he has strong support from the Committee, and that we have given him as good a wind as we can in the important negotiations that he faces.</span></p>
<p>11.39 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I spoke warmly about the English language, but I would not want to be associated with the extraordinary, nationalistic "little Englander" approach of one hon. Member. One regards the use of the beautiful English language as internationally enriching. Shakespeare may have spoke with what would now be heard as a Birmingham accent. He may well have said, "Whether it is nobler in the mind" in Birmingham tones. Probably the only authentic speaker of Shakespearean English would be my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker). It required a Welshman such as Richard Burton to show the English how Shakespeare should be pronounced. That shows the enriching effect of different accents. It can be revealing to hear Shakespeare performed by Indian, Nigerian, West Indian or Chinese actors.<br><br>

We should not view the issue in a petty, nationalistic way. I am painfully aware that if I were to say, "Mae'r deddtgma am Hawlfraint Europeiaidd yn hynod o ddiddoral, ond d'ydy e' ddim yn bosib i siarad yn y dadl yn y Gymraeg. C'est la même chose, si je pose un question en Francais," in this House and persisted in using a different language from English, I should be called to order by the Chairman. Languages other than English seem to have the same status as riotous behaviour, and those who speak them are thrown out of the House.<br><br>
All that shows how extraordinarily narrow culturally we are in this place, when people in the European Parliament manage to cope with up to nine or 10 languages. It reminds me of what happened at the turn of the century when a celebrated notice appeared in a school saying, "Défense de cracher; Défense de parler breton"—"Don't spit; and don't speak Breton". Does the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) wish to intervene?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was musing on how long the hon. Gentleman would continue to speak in other languages before anyone noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite happy to make the rest of my speech in Welsh. If I do, I shall have one of those nice notes from <i>Hansard</i> afterwards, but I have spoken this way several times before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) should not make these attacks on the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 44 on page 28 of the explanatory memorandum uses an extraordinary expression about the lending of media in public libraries. It states that lending is an "exploitation comparable to rental." That view is alien to many English, Welsh and Scottish people because of our long tradition of libraries, which have been so important to past generations of working people. Libraries were often the only form of education available to them. In my area there are also miners institutes, which may be even more important in the future now that higher education is gradually becoming closed to anyone other than the sons of daughters of the rich.<br><br>
Any restriction or diminution of the availability of libraries and universal lending should be regarded as a seriously retrograde step. If we need reasons other than the need for universal access to the treasure house of world literature and knowledge, we should recognise that may people lend before they rent or buy. We need a word from the Minister to emphasise our views on the principle of free libraries—views that are enshrined in all corners of this House and must be defended.</span></p>
<p>11.43 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn). The ability of libraries to lend is very important. As was recognised earlier, "lending" but with a charge is lending and not rental under our library system.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
May I apologise, Mr. Hogg, for my ambiguous remark about the hon. Member for Newport, West. I knew from your reaction that you understood immediately what was happening. I was not making an attack on you. I was merely trying to make a joke—quite a good one—about the hon. Gentleman's style of speaking.<br><br>
There are straight conflicts of interest on these issues. Some of the music-producing interests want to see blank tape levies and other equivalents which do not work. Commission officials should take the views of national Governments and the interests of the member states in the Community and bring them together to improve draft directives on normal European habits. It is good to search for improvement and to listen to those voices. In doing so, is it possible to pay tribute to the Minister's officials and to the officials in the European Community for their work on these immensely complex issues? Not many hon. Members can claim to have understood the directives—even with the benefit of the Scrutiny Committee, the explanatory memorandum and the notes from the European Community. I hope that those thanks will be passed on.<br><br>
I ask the people in the Commission, who have the job of trying to bring these directives together, and the people in the European Parliament, who will consider them, what is the job to be done? That question is well answered by the Library Association's conclusion that it is to balance the interests of users and producers. Can it be done? I do not think that it can. The blank tape levy is one instance where it is impractical. What is the best way of doing it? The first and third questions come from Sir Robin Butler's address to the First Division Association. He did not accept the middle question about whether it can be done. Having decided on the best way, the next question will be is it worth it? Often there are ways of constructing the last pound, penny or ecu in terms of lending right, which are not worth going for.<br><br>
Finally, we could ask the politician's question, is it actually wanted? That is an indirect tribute to the Library Association for what might he called the Islington question. I recall that the House passed legislation that was rejected four to one by the people whom it was supposed to benefit.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) was about to reply for the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I do not think that we have that formal system within the Committee. I wish to speak but I am happy to wait my turn.</span></p>
<p>11.47 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Peter Emery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I am not a member of the Committee, it is illustrative of the workings of these Committees that people can attend who have a particular interest in a matter and make a speech. I only hope

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
that it is the wish of the Procedure Committee that that will increasingly be so as the workings of these Committees progress.<br><br>
The Minister spoke of the amalgamation of powers and implied that the Commission would be better able to act. I hope that he was not giving the impression that the position was becoming a criminal one in which the Commission itself will be acting. Surely it will remain a civil right and the person who has been offended against by the breach of copyright will have to take action? That is the position, and I do not think that the Minister would wish to imply otherwise.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) was more interested in the English language and wanted treaties with America. My hon. Friend the Minister might well have pointed out to him that this will also protect many other aspects—after all, music does not have a language, and there is a vast quantity of music in Greece and Spain and in other areas where we are unable to enforce aspects of copyright—such as the protection necessary for dubbing. Some of us may have seen the recent BBC production in which "Fawlty Towers" in Spanish and "'Allo, 'Allo" in Japanese were advertised as programmes that the BBC was selling round the world—not that the Japanese will be covered by this legislation.<br><br>
Lastly, I want to ask about the duration of rights. What if the Commission decides that the rights should have a duration different from that chosen by the British Government? Can the Government impose a longer period, and can they restrain the right to increase protection? We do not want our rights to be decreased, as the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) said, and Parliament should have the right to choose a longer period.</span></p>
<p>11.50 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr Flynn), and what the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr Bottomley) said about supporting the needs of libraries in the negotiations. We have a strong tradition of using public libraries in Great Britain, and we should set an example for other European countries to follow—perhaps the way that our library system works could be explained during the negotiations. I urge the Government to take on board the interests of public libraries, especially because libraries have not been well served during the Government's term of office. While shops seem to be opening for longer hours, libraries have been open less and less, because of the financial restraints under which local authorities have to operate. I urge the Minister to be vigilant about that matter.<br><br>
Much reference has been made to the need for a proper balance between rights owners and users, which I support. I am most worried, after hearing today's debate, about the vagueness and imprecision of the matter. I support the hon. Member for Eltham in urging us to return to the subject at a later stage. It is worrying that the balance of advantage and disadvantage regarding trade and receipts is unknown, despite the Minister's strong hunch that harmonisation will work out to be in our favour. The Commission's pro-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
posal about rental and lending rights is vague; no figures were attached to the proposals and more information would be appreciated. It is likely that we shall do well from the proposals; if Beethoven were still alive, the Germans might also have done well from them. Mozart would have done very well if some of the arrangements had been in place a couple of hundred years ago. We need to strike a balance so that proceeds benefit not just a few but the industry as a whole.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy spoke earlier about how proceeds would be distributed. That point should be clarified, and I hope that the Minister will comment on it.</span></p>
<p>11.53 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg, for chairing an interesting debate. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) for his comments; he was right to say that we have a difficult task.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) mentioned vagueness. Directives at this stage are often vague, and need to be quantified. We shall work on that, and I am grateful to her for her comments. With regard to her final point, it will be up to the individual affected to enforce his rights and—to answer the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Honiton (Sir P. Emery)—that is a civil right, and will not involve a criminal proceeding: it is up to the person offended to enforce his rights against those who breach them.<br><br>
I have noted what my learned Friend the Member for Honiton said in rebuke to my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell); he was right to describe English as the truly international language, and to comment on the international nature of music. My learned Friend the Member for Honiton also asked whether we had power to impose a longer period than that deemed necessary by our Community partners. If a common right is involved, the answer is no. However, we do not envisage that a shorter period will be imposed, so there should be no problem.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) and for Gateshead, East and my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) spoke about public libraries. Nothing in the directive will require member states to restrict free lending. I hope that that assures the hon. Member for Newport, West, whose speech I enjoyed.<br><br>
Finally, I shall always remember the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham, which should he written on the walls of every Department. He asked what is the job to be done, can it be done, what is the best way to do it, and, above all, is it worth doing?</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved.</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"That this Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 4173/91 relating to copyright and neighbouring rights, 4174/91 relating to accession to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations and 4175/91 relating to rental right, lending right and certain rights related to copyright; and supports the Government's intention to seek adequate protection for copyright owners and performing artists throughout the European Community while having regard to the needs of users of copyright works and of the performers.</p></blockquote></p>
