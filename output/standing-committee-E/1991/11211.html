	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Fitment of Speed Limiters</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter L. Pike 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Giles. We are grateful to receive copies of the documents that we are about to discuss from the Minister for Roads and Traffic. However, annex III is printed in French. Will you clarify that that section is not part of the document that we shall debate? We want to be certain that the Committee shall not discuss proposals that are printed in a different language from that which is the language of this Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member that annex III, which was distributed willingly by the Department of Transport as a working document, is not part of the documents that are under discussion. The hon. Gentleman is right that annex III has formed part of the discussion that has gone on, but it is not part of the documentation that the Committee is called upon to discuss this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Roads and Traffic (Mr. Christopher Chope)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two Commission proposals before us today—8046/91 on the fitment of speed limiters and 7816/91 on the technical standard for speed limiters. the proposal on fitment has been the subject of an intensive series of meetings by officials in the Council's transport working group and it will be put to the Transport Council on 16 December. The technical proposal will go before the Internal Market Council on 19 December. I shall direct most of my remarks to the fitment proposal, although there are some important points to be made about technical standards, especially with regard to enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt about the Community's competence in the sector of vehicle standards. Indeed, many of our vehicle manufacturers are strongly in favour of harmonised European Community rules because they say that domestic standards, which differ from the European norm, can add to their costs. The Government have already provided for the fitment of speed limiters on coaches and new heavy goods vehicles, and we welcome moves towards more widespread use of speed limiters in Europe. One obvious advantage of that is that visiting vehicles from Europe will be speed limited, and, that therefore, our hauliers, operating in competition with foreign hauliers, will not be disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speed limiters would not be needed if lorry and coach drivers did not drive faster than the law allows. Their use could also be avoided if enforcement by the police forces of the Community could ensure
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
that drivers did not exceed speed limits. But that is impractical. In the United Kingdom, 40 per cent of HGVs, weighing more than 7.5 tonnes gross weight, break the speed limit of 60 mph on the motorways and more than 20 per cent exceed 60 mph on dual carriageways, where the lower speed of 50 mph applies. That is why we have already provided for the fitment of limiters to new HGVs that are first used on or after 1 August 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speed limiters offer both road safety and environmental benefits. Casualty savings are available because limiters prevent vehicles from travelling above the legal limit, and excessive speed is a factor in causing road accidents. Environmental benefits arise from a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels, and a reduction in the emission of gases, which contribute to global warming. Although fitting speed limiters represents an additional cost to vehicle operators, there are offsetting benefits, too, which mean that many operators stand to recover their outlay in a fairly short space of time through reduced fuel consumption and less wear and tear on their vehicles. Those operators who only employ responsible drivers, who never travel at illegal speeds, stand to gain little from limiting devices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope of the proposal from the Commission on the fitment of speed limiters, document 8046/91, is wider than we would have liked, particularly on coaches. However, it is probable that the text to be put before the Council will be more restricted. I understand that the Dutch presidency is suggesting that limiters should be required only on coaches over 10 tonnes maximum weight. It is also likely that fitment to existing vehicles will be less demanding and that vehicle operators would have until 1996 to comply. That would be more acceptable, and it would give us plenty of time in which to comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By far the most difficult aspect of the proposal is that it seeks to prescribe Community-wide speeds at which the limiters should be set. The proposal would have the effect of limiting the speeds of lorries and coaches covered by the directive to speeds below the current United Kingdom limits for those vehicles. We have repeatedly said in the transport working group that this is not acceptable to us, and we have placed a reserve on the proposal for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that speed limits should remain a matter for individual member states to decide. They design and maintain their own roads, they have their own rules about driving standards, and casualty statistics differ widely between them. It is true that the United Kingdom has some of the highest speed limits in the Community for coaches and HGVs, but we also have a better road casualty record than most of our European partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To limit vehicles to our current maximum speed limits is one thing, but limiting them to below that speed—thereby incurring a significant cost penalty for no good reason—is going too far. Operators would not be able to recoup the cost of fitting speed limiters if they had to travel at 10 mph below the speed limit. I cannot estimate the precise cost to individual operators because circumstances vary, but it would certainly be significant. The Freight Transport Association—the FTA—suggests that the cost to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
operators would be between £250 million and £500 million, of even £700 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As things stand, none of the other member states seem to have any fundamental difficulty with the speed settings limit proposed by the Commission. That means that there is little room to negotiate. The proposal is subject to majority voting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the proposal on technical standards, document 7816/91. That is based on a standard agreed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, a wider group of countries than the EC. The UNECE has been active for many years on vehicle standards and has good liaison arrangements with the EC. The British standard on speed limiters is also based on the same principles. The technical proposal is therefore acceptable as it stands, except that it, too, has references to set speeds. Those will be dropped from the final text; there will instead be a cross-reference to the limits in proposal 8046/91.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both proposals lack a clear provision on enforcement. If we are to see the full benefits of speed limiters it is essential for member states to introduce adequate arrangements to ensure that they will be properly installed and secured against tampering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with some surprise that we find it difficult to get support from other countries that are in favour of speed limiters, but which do not want them to be tamperproof. I leave it to members of the Committee to draw their own conclusions. However, we shall take up the argument with the Transport Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately, we should like to see a common EC standard to enable member states to use diagnostic equipment to check at annual roadworthiness tests that limiters are working and are correctly calibrated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I invite questions to the Minister, I intend, for the convenience of the Committee, to follow the established rule that gives the Opposition spokesman the opportunity to ask what is called a "composite" question, but allows single questions only from other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, does not the Minister find a paradox in his remarks? He spoke about the desirability of speed limiters being fitted to vehicles here and to vehicles from the continent that come to Britain, and he said that our hauliers would not be disadvantaged. Why then are our hauliers to be disadvantaged if they accept proposed speed limits identical to those that operate on the continent? It is impossible to understand the logic of the Minister's argument. Given that the Government accept cabotage, why do they not accept, in the spirit of cabotage and of free competition, that the speed limits should be identical across the Community? That would be appropriate, otherwise there would surely be an advantage to those who could drive faster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the Minister reject the evidence in paragraph 8 of the draft proposal contained in the section headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Influence on safety, fuel consumption, environment and transport economy"?</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Evidence from the Netherlands seems to cut across the Minister's argument completely. If he wishes to argue differently he should produce the evidence in support of his case. What calculations has he made to support the argument that the cost to industry would be too high? The Government have a duty to provide us with that evidence. Why does the Minister not believe that the costs could be recouped from other savings? If he has made any calculations, what is his estimate of the savings in fuel consumption that would result from the Commission's proposals? What about reductions in carbon dioxide and other noxious emissions, which the Minister acknowledges to be desirable? What calculations have the Government made to balance the negative comments of the Minister?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do the Commission's proposals to fit, retrospectively, speed limiters to a much wider band of vehicles differ from those in the Government's consultation paper? How many vehicles are involved? Does the Minister agree with the FTIA that there would be more lorries on the road as a result of the Commission's proposals? That is an important point. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear.") We need to see the evidence to support the Government's position, especially as it cuts across evidence to the contrary provided from the Netherlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government accept that speed limiters would be worthwhile in terms of reducing casualties and increasing environmental benefits. Does he not agree that such benefits can accrue only if speed limits are lowered? If the logic of the argument is that a reduction in speed brings environmental benefits and reduced casualties, surely we should accept the draft proposal in its entirety. We could gain those important, positive results by lowering the speed of those vehicles that present great potential danger to all road users. Speed limiters should apply not only to coaches with passengers but to heavy freight lorries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the hon. Lady's attitude disappointing. When we debated the Road Traffic Bill we spent almost a year discussing road safety and the desirability of introducing speed limiters. There was no difference between us then and, in my recollection, at no stage did the hon. Lady suggest that we should lower the maximum speed limits for HGVs on motorways. it now seems odd that, merely because some other member states are suggesting it, she should change her tune. That is a pretty supine attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is seeking to intervene on the Minister's answer. She may seek to ask a supplementary question, but this is question time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or a point of information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Sir Giles, will interpret whether it is a point of order or a point of information. I seek
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
your guidance. The Minister made an assertion about another Committee in which he and I were involved and I want to contest it. His assertion was not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot rule on the content of what the Minister said. I advise the hon. Lady to ask a further question as and when the Minister has responded to the list of 18 that she has asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the hon. Lady's recollection of what happened during our debates on the Road Traffic Bill differs from mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no paradox in what I said about competition and international transport. At present, no speed limiters have to be fitted to HGVs from other European countries than come to the United Kingdom. They can go at 70 mph or 80 mph, and many do. If they had to have speed limiters fitted, they would be unable to exceed our national speed limit. Only a small proportion of our own lorries are involved in international transport. To require all our lorries on motorways to go at a speed that is below our national speed limit would be burdensome for our road haulage industry. That is the essence of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked how many vehicles would be involved if extra vehicles had to be put on the roads because each existing vehicle could not be used so much during the day. The FTA has sent the Government and, I imagine, others as well, its estimates of the implications of the draft directive. It carried out a survey of a cross-section of its members. That sample covered 224 members operating 29,500 HGVs and 66,000 smaller goods vehicles. The FTA reported that the current average motorway speed is 56.5 mph. Of those who make regular use of motorways, 20 percent would expect to reduce their use of those roads by an average of 13 per cent if a 50 mph limit were introduced, and 31.3 per cent of those surveyed would expect to increase their vehicle fleet by an average of 8 per cent to compensate for a lower motorway speed limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By applying those figures to all the contributors to the survey, the FTA calculated that the total HGV fleet would increase by 2.8 per cent, which is equivalent to 13,000 extra HGVs on our roads. Co-incidentally, that is almost exactly the number by which we have been able to reduce the incidence of such vehicles on our roads by increasing the weight limit from 32 tonnes to 38 tonnes. The benefit achieved by reducing the number of HGVs on our roads, which was generated by raising the weight limit, would be removed at a stroke by the introduction of a speed limit of 50 mph on motorways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On road safety, the hon. Lady will know that, as confirmed in the FTA letter, vehicles will be diverted from the safest roads, which are our motorways, to less safe roads, because there would be no speed advantage in using the safer roads. That would cause added congestion and danger, so the proposal entails a road safety disbenefit. Although savings in the form of greater fuel efficiency would result from the reduction in speed, there would also be disbenefits,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
such as greater congestion on other roads as a result of the diversions that I described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I ask my first question, may I welcome the agreement that was signed at Maastricht last night and congratulate the Prime Minister on his negotiating skills on behalf of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) mentioned annex III, which was circulated to us by the Minister, and pointed out that it was in French. The first part of that annex refers to objections by the German representatives to the proposal. Can the minister clarify the German Government's current view on the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last clear view expressed to us was that if anyone else opposed the proposal, the Germans would do so also, but that they would not oppose it alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister carried out an independent assessment of any evidence that the proposal would increase the distortion of trade between one member state and another? If there is no detailed independent evidence other than the inquiry carried out in the Netherlands, are we to assume that the decision has been based on one exercise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Dutch presidency was enthusiastic about the proposal. Holland has a problem with speeding HGVs, and it would prefer to have the problem dealt with at Community level instead of at national level. That is the thinking behind Holland's promotion of the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was slightly disappointed when my hon. Friend said that there was not much room for negotiation on some issues. Will he confirm that the proposals will be subject not just to majority voting, but to qualified majority voting, and that Italy and France—as well as Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg—may prefer a higher speed limit than that proposed by the Dutch commissioner?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has my hon. Friend received representations from the coach industry about certain areas that might lose their coach services if the speed limit proposal required that coaches must travel at a speed of 60 mph? That might make it uneconomic for the coach industry to service parts of the country. Can my hon. Friend also—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must remind the hon. Member that only one question at a time can be asked. He can ask other questions later if he so wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have received general representations about the effect of the proposals on the coach industry. For example, if coaches have to travel at less than 70 mph, they will not be able to use the outside lane on motorways. It has been suggested that if coaches have to use the two inside lanes where most of the traffic travels at a maximum speed of 50 mph, de facto, there will be a reduction in coach speeds to 50 mph. That will cause

congestion. The industry implies that that could affect the viability of some long-distance coach services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for my hon. Friend's question about the views of other countries, some argue that a slightly higher speed limit should be set than that proposed by the Commission. None, however, is arguing that there should not be any speed limits or that the speed limits should be the same as the national speed limits here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has an assessment been made of the wear and tear costs on our road surfaces? Do those costs differ when vehicles brake at high speed or low speed? A tremendous amount of road works is continually taking place on our motorways. The damage must be caused by large vehicles, especially when they brake and accelerate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there must be some advantage from the proposal in terms of less road wear, but the fact that there will be as many as another 13,000 HGVs on the roads will counterbalance that advantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, I have to leave the Committee as I must go to a lunch meeting in Southend that will be attended by some lorry operators and one bus operator. Before I go will the Minister clarify one simple point? It has been suggested that this worrying proposal will cost the road haulage industry at least an extra £250 million. It will add to road congestion and will cause delays in the delivery of fresh foodstuffs. Is it, or is it not, the case that, if the majority of member states wish to go ahead with the proposal, it will become the law in Britain, whether or not the British Parliament wants it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister consulted the retail trade industry about the proposal, especially in relation to its effect on the cost to the fresh food industry? I am sorry to say that that extra cost is likely to be passed to the consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has had a meeting with the Retail Consortium, and I know that some of the evidence given to the FTA came from retailers who were interested in the directive's implications for them. It would certainly add to the cost of transport—that will be especially true for hauliers who have been working to fairly tight delivery time constraints. The retail industry has a prominent role in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered the implications of speed limitation on remote areas, such as those in Scotland and the south-west? Presumably calculations have been made about the impact of the proposals on drivers' hours. Journeys will take longer and some journeys will be impossible to complete in one day. Has a study been made of such issues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No precise study has been undertaken, although such issues will have formed part of the evidence given to the FTA. The longer the distances to be travelled, the more difficult it will be to schedule services within drivers' hours limitations if a maximum speed restriction applies that is below the current limit. The suggestion that some touring coaches may no longer be able to reach attractive parts of the country such as the area represented by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) is not borne out by the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall play devil's advocate. The Minister's view is that speed limiters and speed limits should be left to individual countries. He said that a small percentage only of our vehicles go to Europe. Will he consider what difficulties will result if different speed limiter speeds apply to vehicles going from this country to another and vice versa. Difficulties would also result if other countries took a similar view, for example, different limits might apply when vehicles crossed from Germany to France. That could result in a great many problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the present position. There seems to be general propensity for HGVs to speed through Europe regardless of the speed limits that prevail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But, with a speed limiter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a speed limiter is fixed, a lorry will be unable to go faster than the setting on that speed limiter. The hon. Gentleman's argument may be relevant to international transport, but the proposals would apply to all HGVs operating on a national basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the adverse economic consequences of geography may be more important than environmental and safety considerations. However, will my hon. Friend confirm that the proposals will result in no casualty reduction or environmental improvement on roads other than on those on which maximum speed limits apply, and that no estimate has been made of those casualty reductions? If the Community really wants to reduce the speed at which vehicles travel, it should accept that tachograph evidence of excess speed might, if it were used as evidence in court, put the frighteners on drivers more effectively. Will my hon. Friend confirm that the Transport and General Workers Union does not know much about the issues and has not yet opposed the proposals either directly or through the Labour party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend is correct on the last point, although I am sure that he is as well-informed on that issue as he is on many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It became apparent only in the autumn that the speed limiter directive would incorporate set maximum speeds. That obviously means that the proposal is being pushed through faster than many other proposals dealt with by the Commission. It has been difficult to gather the evidence as part of a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
consultaton process. There are many heavy goods vehicle drivers and freight organisations on the continent that have not yet woken up to the implications of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to give any precise figure for casualty reductions. We know that motorways are our safest roads. The consequence of the proposal will be to divert heavy goods vehicles from our safest roads to less safe roads. Obviously, that will have an adverse impact on the number of casualties. However, that will be countered by the fact that vehicles will travel at 50 mph instead of 60 mph. So there might be a reduction in the number of casualties, if those vehicles are involved in accidents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clarify whether the most significant problem with the proposal is the effort that is being made to change the speed limit in this country? If the proposal were to permit each country to set its own speed limits, would the Government take a more benign view of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very much the point, and is made clear in the motion and in the explanatory memorandum. We proposed the introduction of speed limiters on to heavy goods vehicles. There are, however, differences with the Commission's proposal on the extent to which it is reasonable to impose the fitting of speed limiters to old heavy goods vehicles, as that would be uneconomic for operators. We accept the general principle of the benefits of speed limiters, but we do not accept that it is appropriate for the Commission to set our national speed limit for heavy goods vehicles or any other class of vehicle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Donwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have the Government proposed any specific rules for monitoring the effects of speed limiters? One of the objections is that, as usual we would apply the rule but various other countries would not, if the rule were agreed to at the Council. Therefore, have the Government proposed, as a subsidiary argument, the sort of controls that they would expect to be put into operation if the proposal is accepted—obviously, it will be—on a majority vote?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been arguing that point with the Commission and other member states. We have put forward some technical proposals for proper tamperproof speed limiters. When my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State attends the transport council meeting, we hope that other countries will respond positively to his suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify whether he is referring to speed limiters or speed measurers? In other words, will the mechanism stop the ending exceeding a certain speed, or will it simply measure speed? Will lorries from outside the European Community be required to have similar devices?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Community has no power to require lorries from non-member countries to be fitted with speed limiters or, for that matter, to
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
comply with any other standards. We are discussing speed limiters rather than tachographs, which measure speed. Speed limiters will cause the engine to cut out when the vehicle exceeds a certain speed. The only way to avoid that would be to take the vehicle out of gear and allow it to coast, which some people view as a road safety disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that some of his arguments against agreeing with the lower limit—such as the problem of 13,000 additional vehicles—can be turned around? Why have a 60 mph limit, as a 70 mph limit would further reduce the number of vehicles and ensure even faster delivery? Does that mean that there has not been enough research into the environmental implications and safety aspects of the proposals, or into the real basis of what the Government put to us this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's view is that if something is working well, it should not be changed. However, if something has to be changed, we should ensure that we have good, sound reasons and good evidence. There is no evidence to suggest that the proposed changes will produce a road safety benefit. The economic consequences will certainly be dire for many transport operators, who will face costs of hundreds of millions of pounds. The balance between a 70 mph limit and a 60 mph limit on motorways has been well-judged; it was evaluated on the basis of proper evidence. There is no evidence that this proposal has been so evaluated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that the Gerondeau report of the European committee of road safety experts recommends that things should not be legislated for unless there will be a proven advantage that cannot be gained in some other way? Can my hon. Friend also confirm that the only benefit referred to in the explanatory memorandum is a possible reduction in road casualties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As our road casualty figures were measured between 1981 and 1985, the rate at which people have been killed or seriously injured on the roads in the United Kingdom has falled by 40 per cent. If the European Community wants equality, it should arrange for all cars and lorries to be driven at 20 mph or 32.5 kph. The rest of Europe might then achieve the same safety record as Britain. If the Community wants to cut casualty rates, it should pay more attention to what we say and what we do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes fair points. It is apparent that countries in the European Community have not yet taken unilateral action, which is quite open to them, to require speed limiters to be fitted to their heavy goods vehicles. We have taken such unilateral action because we thought that it had merit. The means by which other countries could improve their road safety records have not been exhausted, yet they now seek Community-wide action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we push a little further the argument about helping our European colleagues? We are all in favour of stopping lorries from speeding;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
I certainly am for my constituency. There are several ways of achieving that. One is to fit speed limiters, which we do here. Another is to fit tachographs, which we do here. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) said, we should ensure that evidence produced by tachographs is used in court to prosecute offenders—in other words, the law should have teeth. Lastly—as my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) hinted from a sedentary position—there is no point in the proposal if we cannot insist that vehicles coming into the country from outside the European Community are not fitted with these devices. That is how our commitment to operate at the heart of Europe should be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what my hon. Friend says. She raises some good points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no precise equivalent—no equivalent in round numbers—of contintental speed limits in kilometres per hour. Does my hon. Friend agree that if, at worst, it was necessary to conform to a speed limit proposed by the Commission, it would be nonsense for us to have a speed limit in miles per hour with a figure two at the end? It has already been agreed that we can continue to use miles in this country, without any limit. What would be our negotiating position if we reached that state of affairs? Would we be able to round up or would we have to round down? It would be a nonsense for us to have an even lower speed limit than that proposed by the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not reached that stage yet, but my hon. Friend is right that we have a derogation to measure speed in miles per hour. We intend to continue taking advantage of that. The draft directive is expressed in kilometres per hour. We shall have to translate that into miles per hour for our domestic regulations, should the need arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the phrase "I hear what you say" is used by English judges to reassure barristers shortly before their cases collapse in ruins about them? I wish to press my hon. Friend further on his views about vehicles coming into the Community from outside. Surely they should be subject to the same limitations as trucks operating within the Community. Will the Government, in the light of the forceful represenation of my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie), take the matter up with the Community to ensure that, if that is not the case now, it will be in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a practical difficulty with that. It would be difficult to enforce a requirement for a heavy goods vehicle travelling from, say, Turkey to have a speed limiter fitted before entering the European Community. There is an argument for having the widest possible Europe and that is, I think, what my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is seeking to achieve. It would not be practical to put up barriers against heavy goods vehicles coming into the Community to make deliveries. Obviously, such vehicles use of cabotage within the Community is already restricted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for leaving the Room and I hope that the subject of my question was not dealt with while I was out. What timescale does the Minister expect the proposal to work to? Does he expect the Portuguese to be as enthusiastic about it as the Dutch?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say that the Portuguese have an appalling road safety record and are therefore keen on anything that would restrain the behaviour of their HGV drivers. The Dutch Presidency aims to push the matter to a conclusion at the Transport Council next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my earlier question, is the Minister saying that, in the interests of a wider Europe, trucks should be allowed into the Community although they might not meet the requirements of the MOT test in this country, do not have adequate brakes or do not have such environmental devices fitted as the Community may require in future? Surely the purpose of the Community is to improve the standard of environmental law and of protection for the public, not to worsen them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principles are that vehicles must be roadworthy and safe; those are common international conventions relating to the international circulation of road traffic. However, there is no requirement that vehicles must have fitted particular speed limiters or what many people would regard as extras to participate in international road haulage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that because the Dutch have one of the better records on road casualty reduction, they understand that it would be helpful, in terms of the proposal on speed; if speed surveys were carried out in member states on different categories of roads? That would give an estimate of how a reduction in speed—on maximum speed limit roads or other roads—affected the severity of injury or the number of crashes that occurred. Will my hon. Friend also re-emphasise the point that speed limiters should indeed limit speed and not be a means of cruise control because countries such as Britain sometimes obey such laws and other countries tend not to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that speed limiters will not be required on minibuses because that would have a disproportionate effect on the 65,000 to 85,000 minibuses in Britain that are used by voluntary groups. They are seldom used on motorways. They are mostly used for taking small groups of elderly or disadvantaged people around their locality, to prevent their being immobile or having to have their own cars or to use public buses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point about cruise control is an important one. It goes to the heart of the issue of enforcement. That is why the Government argue that speed limiters should be tamperproof. The amendments that are likely to be brought forward to raise the tonnage limits for coaches will allow minibuses to operate without being subject to that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
restriction. I hope that that will allay my hon. Friend's concern on the matter. He raised a third point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the point about getting surveys on the speed at which vehicles actually travel, as distinct from the national speed limits, on the different categories of road, and integrating those surveys with the level and incidence of the severity and outcome of crashes. That would give some estimate from European Community, if not from each member country's Government, of the potential for reducing road casualties. That must be balanced against legislating for such matters, nationally or on an EC-wide basis, which might have a greater effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to remind you, Sir Giles, that we have reduced our casualties because we tend to apply what works and matters most rather than what seems to be popular to someone sitting in a back office who does not understand the psychology and physics of road crashes and their consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend said, that point is emphasised in the Gerondeau report. There is a need for proper scientific analysis of the evidence before imposing a measure that purports to produce benefits by improving road safety. The Government are disappointed that the Dutch should have produced a proposal without adequate evidence to show that it will achieve its purport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the fitting of speed limiters be incorporated in any definition of roadworthiness?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could be incorporated in construction and use regulations, but I am instructed that it could not be incorporated in the terms of the current international convention relating to transport between one country and another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend care to speculate on the effect of the regulations on a company in my constituency? It has a subsidiary in the north-east of England which receives 42 minutes' notice to deliver component parts to the Nissan car factory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether my hon. Friend is saying that it has only 42 minutes in which to make the journey or that it receives only 42 minutes' notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may make that clear, the subsidiary has 42 minutes from the time of the call for the components which it produces to the time when they have to arrive at the Nissan plant. If the firm's vehicles are restricted in speed on a relatively short journey involving a small time scale, there might have to be a substantial increase in the number of its vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot challenge the logic of my hon. Friend's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the all-party road passenger transport group is solidly behind his proposed amendment? There was a unanimous
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
vote for that last night. If the Dutch proposal were accepted, what effect would the fitting of the device have on British operators who drive public service vehicles not only on this side of the Channel but on the continent? If my understanding of the suggestion is correct, speed will be monitored down to a certain level. In other words, the speed cannot rise above the fuel flow that the decide permits. At present, the flexible system in Britain allows the fitting of a device, but it does not control the limitation of speed. There is a voluntary limit of 70 mph, but that would no longer apply if the proposal were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would my hon. Friend also tell me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Member that he may ask one question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks a technical question. The answer is that the technical directive ensures not only cruise control. Domestically, we can insist on having authorised fitters to instal the speed limiters. If I have not dealt with other aspects of my hon. Friend's point I shall be happy to talk to him about them later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that there is genuine interest in this country in reducing unnecessary fuel consumption, air pollution, the severity of injuries and the number of crashes? Most of the questions were designed to try to stimulate a rational discussion of the benefits and disbenefits associated with a particular speed limit. It would be helpful if the European Commissioner, Karel van Miert, could meet the Dutch Presidency and others who have a general interest, to establish whether it is necessary to deal with the speed limit in the rush to achieve a technical definition of the speed limiter, or whether it would be possible to consider the speed limit after more evidence had been presented and more questions had been answered, while still obtaining the benefits of speed limiters being fitting to lorries and buses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a persuasive point. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will try to persuade our European partners next week that it is not appropriate to incorporate a set speed at this stage and that we should concentrate on the speed limiter directive, without reference to a set speed. That would open up the opportunity for further research of the kind to which my hon. Friend referred. However, I am pessimistic that that common-sense view will prevail among our European partners at that meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that he has no independent evidence with which to support any of his arguments against the lowering of the speed limit? He has quoted evidence only from the FTA and has done nothing to substantiate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister quoted the average speed of lorries on British roads, which is part of the calculation of how many lorries would be required to carry a particular number of loads in a particular period, but is he confident that that average speed was derived from vehicles operating within current speed limits?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
If he is confident that none of those lorries was breaking the speed limit, the evidence clearly does not stand up, because he acknowledges that a considerable number of vehicles travel above the speed limit. Why does he accept a calculation from one organisation that there would be 30,500 additional lorries on the road, when there is no comparable evidence—he has presented none—from other European states?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of the measure is to provide environmental benefits and to reduce casualties. If the evidence was so clear that such numbers of additional lorries would result from the proposal, every other country in Europe would suffer a similar fate. It seems unlikely that they have not examined that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister want to revise his reply to the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill)? It is extraordinary that the Minister accepts that there can be any fixed journey time, given the congestion on our roads and the fixed speed limits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady referring to me?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not. The hon. Lady intervened, but I am not referring to her. I refer to the quote about the 42-minute journey and I suggest that it is impossible for any journey to be of a fixed time when road conditions are unpredictable. That suggests that drivers may be put at risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I may.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Finally, will the Minister acknowledge that if there is to be a proper assessment of the acceptability of the proposal and of the benefits and disbenefits that it would entail, there must be a thorough examination of journey times, and costs must be set against savings? Congestion is a major factor in journey times and the Government could take measures to reduce congestion—for example, lorry-only routes. There are many other ways in which the journey times of lorries could be influenced; speed is only one factor. The Minister has not offered us the evidence to support his case. Perhaps he will try again to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admit that I have been relying to a great extent on two words, "common sense", which appeal to the majority of the Committee. Surely it accords with common sense that if a vehicle has a maximum speed of 50 mph rather than 60 mph it will take longer on average to get between two fixed points. If goods are to be carried between two fixed points, either more vehicles will have to be employed, or the same number of vehicles will be used but for longer periods. That would mean either more vehicles on the roads, or that drivers would be at the wheel for longer periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the 10 mph advantage for an HGV of using the motorway is removed, many HGVs will use ordinary
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
dual carriageways or single carriageway roads, which we know from statistical evidence are much less safe for cars and HGVs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many urban areas there is already considerable congestion. A major contributory factor to accidents is driver frustration and a driver's feeling that he will not reach his destination in the time specified. Our roads are congested, especially in urban areas, but the HGV operator knows that when he gets on to the open motorway he can drive at 60 mph. Under this proposal he would only be able to drive at 50 mph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence is clear. It accords with common sense and is supported by the road haulage industry and by the work that the Department has carried out. We recognise that operators will incur costs, that savings in fuel will be made and that there will be some costs associated with the diversion of traffic from motorways on to other roads. We do not have precise figures for that. If it was a domestic proposal we would consider the evidence before we changed the law. Many hon. Members have made that point. That evidence is not available, so there is no reason to change the maximum speed at which HGVs operate in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal comes under article 100A. Will the Minister remind us of the contents of that article? Does it refer to roadworthiness and safety? If it does, that would apply to vehicles coming into the European Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 100A deals with construction and article 75 deals with general transport and road safety aspects. There was an argument in the past about whether the Commission was competent in matters of transport safety, but that has been resolved. I am told that the amended treaty following the summit specifically includes in article 75(1) point (c) additional measures to improve transport safety. So there is no dispute that the Commission has competence in this area; the question is whether the Commission is wise to push a proposal if there is insufficient evidence to justify it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I consider that we have concluded the period of question time. We now move to consideration of the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document Nos. 7816/91 and 8046/91, relating to the compulsory fitment of speed limiters to certain classes of heavy goods vehicles and passenger carrying vehicles; and agrees with the Government's view that, whilst fitting speed limiters should bring worthwhile casualty savings and environmental benefits, the speed at which limiters are set is a matter which it would be appropriate to leave to individual Member States to determine.—[	<i>Mr. Chope.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.29 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter L. Pike 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to consider two separate and distinct issues: whether speed limiters should be fitted, and at what speed they should be set. The argument for fitting the devices is fair and reasonable. I agree with the Minister that it is common sense to fit speed limiters. However, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
the EC extends, transport will continue to cross its borders. The requirement should apply to those vehicles in the categories covered by the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) put his finger on it when he spoke about roadworthiness—a test of which I would include in the legislation. All vehicles coming into this country—goods vehicles, buses and even cars—should meet the minimum requirements of our MOT test and any other requirements relating to safety and the environment. As we move towards harmonisation, we should move upwards to achieve the highest possible standards. There is a wide degree of agreement that speed limiters should be fitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not made a good case. Only a small percentage of vehicles from the United Kingdom go to the continent. However, that small percentage represents a large number of vehicles, and it is increasing. No one knows how the channel tunnel will affect such traffic. I would like to see more long-distance freight going onto rail, but that may not happen. We see many vehicles from the continent on our motorways, including lorries delivering goods and coaches on holiday trips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The different speeds advocated by the Government will cause difficulties; but they represent an even greater problem within Europe. I am sure that those countries will argue their own cases best, because crossing boundaries in Europe is now so simple. When I travelled from Italy into France last year, I came across a sign at the boundary saying "Halt". There was nobody in sight, and the people waiting in their vehicles could have been there a long time. So many boundary posts are isolated and are not controlled, that it would be difficult to ensure compliance when moving from one speed limit to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree with the Minister that the devices should be tamperproof. However, if they need to be changed for travel from one country to another, they can be more easily tampered with. I assume that they will have to be set at the speed limit of the country where the vehicle is registered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman has travelled the world extensively and will, no doubt, have come across the same inconvenience as I did when I was in the United States. On moving from state to state, drivers are confronted with a barrage of signs saying "No Right Turn", "Turn Right on Red" or informing drivers that the speed limit will be different over the state border. Signs about many other regulations such as no stopping on the freeway are particular to certain states. In a growing European Community, surely we do not want to follow that practice. We should be able to achieve some standardisation of driving procedures, so that the same signs and standards apply throughout the Community. We would not then suffer adjustment problems at obscure border posts in such countries as Luxembourg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not often that I agree with the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we do. Anyway, I agree with the hon. Gentleman's last point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to being the devil's advocate because the Minister argued that, if the speed limit were lowered, as many as 13,000 extra HGVs would be on the road. he talked about the consequential costs to industries and so on. I put the argument the other way, and said that an increase in speed limits might reduce the number of vehicles on the road. The hon. Gentleman said that research has proved that the status quo was the right approach. I doubt whether sufficient research has been carried out from the point of view of safety, the environment and energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that travel times will increase under the proposal. I travel a great deal by car and, whatever speed limits are imposed, much progress is made if the roads are clear. It is traffic jams that hamper progress. For example, if a driver travels at 30 or 40 mph, he could arrive at Birmingham at almost the same time as the driver who travels there at 70 mph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says, "No", but I assure him that my journey time to Burnley tends to be the same whatever the traffic conditions and whatever the time of day. We want to ensure that we are doing something that is environmentally right and which sets high safety standards. Much more research needs to be carried out into the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that member countries have different views about speed limits. However, we have not necessarily got our act together. Whatever the speed limits are our travel times are governed by the weather and road conditions. Too many drivers believe that they must travel at the maximum speed limit that is imposed; they pay no regard to weather conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Edwina Currie: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I have listened to the hon. Gentleman wittering on with all the respect that I can summon, but he is basically arguing that speed limiters should be fitted to all cars, including his own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Lady's point. I am arguing that vehicles should travel at a safe speed. If we accept the proposal now, we might be arguing in five, 10 or 15 years' time that speed limiters should be fitted to all vehicles. Those who drive on motorways know that, when they reach the part on which a limit of 50 mph is imposed, other drivers flash their lights and hoot, because they wish to travel at 70 or 80 mph. The hon. Lady's point may well be valid, but we have not reached that stage yet. I do not propose to press the motion to a Division; it seems as though it will be accepted in Europe. The United Kingdom should be doing much more research into the matter and examine the safety and environmental implications of such proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hayward 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking this morning as a former employee of two companies that were members of the FTA. I have previously spoken in this Committee in defence of national sovereignty because proposals have been presented to us on which I believed that our Government should have the right to decide. However, on this occasion, I disagree with the FTA and the arguments about national sovereignty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that there are strong reasons why we should retain different speed limits for HGVs from other parts of Europe, but we shall have to tackle that problem. An ever-increasing number of vehicles cross the channel to Europe and that figure will rise still higher in coming years. I agree with the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) and I hope that much more goods traffic will be transferred to the railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the construction of the channel tunnel, it is likely that even greater numbers of HGVs will travel through Kent and East Sussex on their way to the continent than pass through those counties now. As the hon. Member for Burnley said, if the limiters attached to vehicles had to be adjusted each time they crossed the channel in one direction or the other, that would be a fascinating development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the position of a member of the FTA, a small company with two or three vehicles that regularly cross the channel. Let us suppose that one of them is out of service, another is held up by a border dispute in Spain or Italy and that the firm is required to make an urgent delivery that cannot be sent by rail. It would be unable to make that delivery by lorry unless it could alter the speed limiter to apply to the limit on the other side of the channel. It makes no economic sense to stick on the question of speed limits now when we know that, in a few years, we are likely to have to fall into line with other European countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly agreed with the Minister's comment about the increasing number of HGVs that are likely to appear on the roads. I represent a constituency in which one of the biggest employers is a manufacturer of HGV parts, so I have a vested interest in accepting that argument. I am sure that the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs Dunwoody) also accepted it. There is a strong argument for the idea of a commonality of speed limits to be accepted sooner rather than later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that a problem is posed by vehicles from outside the EC. Another current problem involves the weights of lorries coming to this country, which are not adequately checked. I do not believe that we have a proper mechanism for checking vehicles arriving from eastern Europe and other non-EC countries, but we can deal with that matter later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the comments of the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms Ruddock) and those of her colleague, the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich who clearly did not agree with her. That revealed the disunity that exists among Opposition Members. I hesitate to make a point while the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) is absent, but I believe that he, too, did not support the Labour proposal in the main debate.
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
If I am wrong, no doubt someone will correct me. However, it seems that, again, the Opposition are more divided on the European issue than Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should adopt a more positive approach, but I recognise that some matters should be negotiated. We should make progress as quickly as possible because, ultimately, we shall have to accept the proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.43 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Harris (St. Ives)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to you, Sir Giles, and the Committee for being absent for part of the proceedings. It was due to an old problem that affects many of us who are members of two Committees that are sitting at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Hayward) and the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) about the difficulties caused by vehicles crossing from one country to another. I do not have my hon. Friend's expertise, so I do not know how easy it would be to adjust a limiter each time a vehicle crossed a border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is not the proposal for a Europe-wide limit—I see merit in that—but the miles per hour suggested for that limit. I am worried about the effect of the proposed reduction on goods traffic and coaches from remote areas, as I represent St. Ives, the constituency furthest from the capital in that direction. I foresee problems also for hauliers and coach operators in Scotland and Wales. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood does not have that problem, as Bristol is not too far from the centre, but I am sure that hauliers and coach operators in Cornwall will be up in arms when they hear of the proposals and I am astounded that I have had no representations from them. Perhaps that is due to the fact that, as my hon. Friend the Minister said, the proposals have come through in a rush.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help feeling that we are in danger of being bounced by the Community on the matter. My plea to the Minister is that the Government should go on arguing about it. The Secretary of State should try to kick the proposals into touch at the meeting of the Transport Councils which loom later this month. We must aim for agreement, not about whether nations should have the right to impose limiters at a particular speed, but on a sensible scheme for the operation of limiters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.46 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Minister and the position that he is taking on the proposals. It is significant that Britain has been well ahead on fitting speed limiters. Anyone who doubts our record on road safety has only to look at the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a significant difference between Britain and other countries in the Community in terms of enforcement. It is curious that on this matter, as on many others, Transport Ministers throughout the Community seem to be glibly talking about new regulations, without taking into account the need to enforce them and the fact that existing limits, although lower in many parts of Europe, are not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
enforced. Many companies in the FTA have reported that their drivers travelling at the speed limit in Europe are passed regularly by the native drivers in those countries, as the level of enforcement is much lower than in Britain. That tends to be the case in many areas of Community activity. Britain always seems to be the country that puts into effect the requirements imposed by its obligations and enforces them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that, while the Community is unable to eliminate many of the restrictions applying to transport—those applying to freight, for example—it tries to impose new ones which in this case have many disadvantages and no benefits, so far as I can see. It could be argued that, in their effect on road safety, some of these proposals could be counterproductive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our discussions this morning, coach travel has been somewhat neglected. Many members of the Bus and Coach Council argue that there will be a substantial reduction in the express network services. Although fears have been expressed that certain services in the extremities of the country and in Scotland and Wales might be eliminated, that is contrary to the views of several coach companies about what is likely to happen. Two of the most prominent companies, Shearings and Wallace Arnold, which together operate 600 vehicles, have said that they foresee a cost increase for drivers alone of about £1.5 million net per annum and the withdrawal of significant parts of their touring programmes. The tours withdrawn due to higher costs and less attractive timings would affect the remoter parts of Britain most, such as Cornwall, Wales and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is curious that the hon. Lady, whose party is strong in Scotland and Wales, is prepared to envisage that situation without expressing any concern for the many people in Scotland and Wales who would be disadvantaged and who regularly use coach services to travel to other parts of Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am greatly concerned about those people who journey from Scotland to, for example, the south-east of England. My greatest concern is for their safety and comfort. I am sorry to tell the hon. Gentleman that I have seen many coaches making that journey that are not observing even the current maximum speed limit on our motorways. They are a danger and road safety requires a reduction in speed limits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the problem of coaches that do not observe speed limits is the speed limiter, which my hon. Friend the Minister for Roads and Transport has introduced. No one is arguing against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Lady has listened to coach companies. They believe that there would be significant road safety disadvantages, especially on two-lane motorways, if the limit were introduced and there were different sorts of traffic travelling on those roads. I ask the hon. Lady to consider their views more carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Another threat to coaching is the elimination of real competition with the railways. Trains now travel much more quickly. We would be asking the coach industry to operate with one hand tied behind its back if we required coaches to travel at half the speed of trains. That is a fundamentally anti-competitive approach, especially in view of the future privatisation of parts of the British Rail network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have gone a long way towards eliminating the bottlenecks in the coaching market. They resisted the Labour party's opposition and brought about deregulation, which has resulted in a healthy coach industry. That would be put at nought at a stroke if the proposed lower speed limit were introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The freight industry, too, is rightly concerned. The arguments of the FTA are extremely convincing. Many companies would face much greater costs. Different estimates of the additional costs have been made, but those based on the FTA's assumptions produce lost revenue opportunities of between £665 million and £884 million per annum. Those additional costs would be passed to consumers, so the proposal would be inflationary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past I have argued the benefits of heavier but not necessarily larger lorries. Some have doubted my assertion that we would have fewer lorries if heavier lorries were allowed on the roads. The figures bear out my forecasts. Between 1984 and 1989, the number of heavy goods vehicles increased by only 5.9 per cent, but productivity increased by 36.2 per cent. That could not have come about without a trend towards heavier vehicles. If we introduce a lower speed limit of about 50 mph, we would encourage a trend towards lighter, smaller vehicles. We would also encourage more vehicles with consequent disadvantages of pollution and emissions. Those vehicles would be encouraged to use roads other than motorways. Motorways are well known to be the safest roads and HGVs have a good safety record compared with cars in terms of miles travelled. If vehicles gained no time travelling at faster speeds on motorways, they would use shorter routes on less safe roads through populated areas, which would have many environmental disadvantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In road safety terms, it has been well documented that the difference in speeds between vehicles represents one of the greatest threats to safety. In 1968, the Green Paper, "How Fast?", puts that point well. Paragraph 54 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There may be some case … for limiting the speed of heavy goods vehicles on motorways, as is widely the practice abroad."</p></blockquote>
This was many years ago. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is, of course, some risk that this would reduce the relative attractiveness of the motorways for these vehicles and cause them to use the all-purpose roads, which are more crowded and dangerous and where they would cause more congestion."</p></blockquote>
The document also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is some evidence to suggest that accident risks on motorways and other roads increase with the speed differentials of traffic, i.e. the difference between the speeds of the slower and faster vehicles using the roads".</p></blockquote>
Common sense bears that out. That Green Paper was far-sighted in many of its proposals. It foresaw many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
problems that would arise if a speed differential was established between goods vehicles and other vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already referred to the issue of enforcement. It is clear that the enforcement of existing limits in many parts of Europe is minimal. Many HGVs exceed 80 kph with apparent impunity. My hon. Friend the Minister for Roads and Transport has adopted the right course. He is right to go along with the proposal, with which we have already complied, that speed devices should be the norm throughout Europe, but our proposal on where the speed should be set, is superior to that proposed by other countries. It is not the case that all countries want lower speed limits. There is support for retaining a higher limit than the kph equivalent of 50 mph. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take a leaf out of the book of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and argue with all the force at his command in favour of that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That group is comprised of Members of Parliament and a large number of transport operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are about 126 carriage and coach operators in this country who are members of the Bus and Coach Council and members of that all-party group. At last night's annual general meeting about 60 of those members were present. The wording of our motion was read to the group and, after a full debate on the matter, the motion received unanimous backing. The view of the British operators is therefore known and takes several aspects into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, some of the world's most heavily used motorways are located in this country. Their capacity is taken up for a longer period than it is on most motorways. Secondly, there is an unusual mix of vehicles on our motorways. User patterns very throughout the continent, which accounts for the different view taken on speed inhibition on continental motorways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
For example, in France part of the strategic motorway network is largely made up of toll roads, which are used by certain classes of users only. I asked my French son-in-law whether he uses French toll roads. He said that he does so when he is driving a company car, but that at other times he uses other roads. There is a clear differential and it is noticeable that toll roads are not used to the same extent as general roads. That means that the system is totally different in France, as it is in Holland and in other European countries. I accept that that might be the subject for a different debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Heavy goods vehicles have to wait at borders for a long time in many Common Market countries and the journey time between stops seems to be different from that in this country. That may explain the different approach to the inhibition of speed on motorways that has been adopted on the continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My intuition is that those inhibitors would not be flexible in regard to changing the maximum setting from one speed to another. My understanding is that the speed should be governed permanently at a maximum level, which would mean, as I tried to elicit in an earlier question, that different instruments would have to be fitted to deal with that. However, I am open to correction on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the proposal change the lane discipline procedure followed in this country? Would there be compulsory edicts from Europe, following this one, which would alter the configuration of lane discipline and its utilisation? The maximum use of motorways depends not only on the utilisation of the fast lanes for overtaking by certain classifications of vehicle, but on returning to the under-occupied, slower lanes after that manoeuvre has been made. If, because of voluntary or compulsory measures, it were not possible for certain classification of vehicles to utilise faster lanes, such as the larger commercial vehicles, buses and coaches, that would lead to substantial bunching and, therefore, traffic jams. In their discussions last night, members of the Bus and Coach Council brought this point to bear in their decisions. The proposal would be disadvantageous not only to drivers of those vehicles which must travel long distances at reasonably high speeds, but to traffic as a whole as it would create overloading and bunching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a highly developed system of road and motorway utilisation by both professional and lay drivers. It is imperative to bear in mind that the category M	<div class='sub'>3,</div> <!-- sub --> which is referred to in the European document, will include in those public sector vehicles with more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat and with a maximum weight exceeding 5 metric tonnes. That is quite a small vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This European proposition would have overriding disadvantages. Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.8 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reference has been made to the stance of the Labour party and its possible disunity. Let me make it clear that the Labour party has published its views on speed limits in its policy documents. We have said that we would seek a review of speed limits in the context of environmental
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
considerations and road safety. It is in the spirit of that policy that we debate this matter this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour group in the European Parliament has already adopted a position on the draft proposal and is wholly in favour of it. Labour Members in the Committee are being more cautious; we have sought, in our questioning, to find out the necessary evidence from the Minister. But we are exceedingly disappointed because the Minister consistently fails to offer independent evidence on which anyone could reach a sound conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not made clear the Government's view on coaches and buses. The evidence from the FTA that we heard today deals with lorries and the possible economic consequences for the industry. However, there has not been a full discussion of the environmental, road safety and passenger safety consequences of a lower speed limit for coaches and buses. We believe that such a reduction is desirable—that is also the view of the TGWU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady and her colleagues have put a particularly one-sided case. Eastern Europe is centralised and highly controlled yet pollution levels are far greater than we in the capitalist society of western Europe enjoy. If the hon. Lady succeeded in choking the capacity of the wealth-creating sector of our society to generate the funds from which all other good things flow, she would do this nation a great disservice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be the Conservative party's intention to aim for the lowest possible standards, but the Labour party aims for the highest possible standards. The massive pollution in eastern Europe is extremely regrettable, but that does not mean that we should adopt anything less than the highest achievable standards, especially given the base from which we begin. Higher standards are possible, and lower speed limits are one way in which to benefit the environment and improve road safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the TGWU who drive such vehicles are under timetable pressure because of the very wealth creation, or profit making, to which the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) referred. It is not desirable for drivers to feel pressurised to break the speed limit or complete journeys which, because of congestion, result in their taking shorter breaks than those to which they should be entitled. Such practices are hazardous, and workers in the industry support a stricter regime. They believe that that will benefit them and ensure greater passenger safety.

The Minister may correct me, but we have no further information about the inquiry into the crash in France, to which reference has been made in other committees. However, speed was thought to have been a significant factor in that tragic coach accident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that the Labour party was embarking on a review of speed limits, and I understand the reason for that. Is she now saying that she is happy for that review to be pre-empted by fixing limits for buses and goods vehicles? Is she saying that she fully supports a reduction from 60
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously it is not possible to conduct a review while we are in opposition. Our policy statement says that we will conduct a review when we are in government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may finish—we are prepared to examine the European proposal to see if the evidence suggests that it would be to the advantage of the Community in general, and to Britain especially, if such a speed reduction took place. Evidence coming from Europe suggests that the proposal would be to our advantage. The evidence provided by the Government is so weak that a conclusion is not possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle we are in favour of speed limiters. We believe that there is a relationship between speed and accidents. Therefore we want the speed limit to be lowered unless there is concrete evidence to the contrary. The number of vehicles on the road is also a relevant factor. We would be prepared to weigh that in the balance. We have not, however, found the Government's evidence sufficiently clear and convincing to say that the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles should not be reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Lady is avoiding the question. The difficulty is that the proposal is here now, and we have to judge whether it proposes a reasonable limit. The Government have to be clear about the matter. Several of my hon. Friends have said that the proposed speed reduction for lorries is too great—although, we do not argue against the principle of a reduction—and will cause too much damage. What is the hon. Lady's opinion? She cannot dodge the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to dodge the proposal. It is the Government's responsibility. From the speeches I have heard, it appears that Conservative Members are equally divided; some say that the proposed lower speed limit is acceptable and others say that it is not. We are seeking clarification of the issues. That is our role and duty as the Opposition. I have clearly stated our policy and philosophy. We need to have the evidence. Unfortunately, it has not been forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it a fact that we are not rigidly opposed to what the Government have said, but we believe that they have not proved their case? We were told from the start that Europe will almost certainly agree to the proposal in majority vote, which will mean that it must be implemented.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most confused by the hon. Lady's answer. Surely, it is more appropriate for the Government to state their anxieties now, rather than do what the hon. Lady suggests the Labour party will do.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the hon. Gentleman is not trying very hard. I have made it absolutely clear that we have a published policy statement, in which we say that we shall review all speed limits when we are in Government. We now have an opportunity to debate those speed limits and there is a proposal before us. I have made it very clear that, in our view, a reduction in speed limits is desirable, because it would result in fewer casualties and less environmental damage. In that context, we came here to support the draft proposal. The questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley and myself were appropriate, as the Government should give us further evidence on which we could, if necessary, modify our view. The evidence has not been clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If vehicle numbers increase as a consequence of the proposal, we must weigh that in the balance. We have had no evidence from the industry on how the increase would relate to the fuel savings that would accrue from a slower speed. Evidence has not been produced which takes into account the predictable advent of heavier lorries in Europe. We all know that is a real possibility and another factor in the equation between the number of vehicles and speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the costs that industry would have to bear. That has to be put into the context of the £20 billion per annum that the Confederation of British Industry estimates is lost because of road congestion. The situation is more complex than the Government have been prepared
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
to acknowledge this morning. I cannot accept at face value the restrictive consequences of the measures that the FTA has suggested. We have not heard about all the factors or their interrelationship. That is the job of government and the Minister has failed to undertake it on this morning's evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of the figure for congestion that the hon. Lady quoted. The coach operators, who are perhaps in the best position to know, say that their costs would increase considerably. Therefore, is not it likely that fares would have to rise? If that is the case, the differential between the cost of coach travel and car travel would narrow. Would not that bring about a shift in favour of the use of cars and therefore increased environmental disbenefits, contrary to the hon. Lady's policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would be correct if that were proved. It would be against our philosophy and policy for transport if the consequence was more use of cars. That is why I do not believe that we have heard a sound case. The case has not been proven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the balance between costs and savings, fuel reductions must be taken into account. It is well known that travelling at high speeds and braking frequently causes greater wear and tear on the vehicle and uses more fuel. A more consistent pattern of speed can reduce fuel consumption. If the average speed is lowered, fuel consumption is reduced. The estimates that we have show a 5 to 10 per cent reduction in fuel use through the use of speed limiters in coaches and HGVs. That is based on the evidence of fleet owners who have already put speed limiters on their vehicles on a voluntary basis. That saving must be balanced in the equation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also concrete evidence—provided by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, which we frequently quote in road safety Committees—that speed limiters greatly increase road safety. Research shows that the faster the speed the shorter the available reaction time; the faster the speed the longer the braking distance; the faster the speed the greater the impact; and the faster the speed, especially with HGVs and coaches, the greater the amount of water spray produced, which obscures the vision of other motorists. Those are significant factors. Road safety is good in Britain, but it is nowhere near good enough when nearly 5,000 people a year are killed and tens of thousands injured. We must not accept inaction when we could further improve road safety and the general environment. Unless there is strong evidence for the contrary, we should support the proposed speed limit reductions and the fitting of speed limiters to coaches, buses and HGVs as outlined in the draft directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about enforcement? When I use the motorways, I often see coaches, which, by law, should already have speed limiters, travelling above 70 mph. The Minister should comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be harmonisation. Fleets of lorries, buses and coaches cannot traverse a Europe with different speed limits in different countries if speed limiters are to be fitted. That would be impossible.

Conservative Members have tried to present last night's events in Maastricht as a triumph. It is no triumph for Britain to be isolated while 11 other countries press on with a social dimension from which Britain is excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is moving a long way from the terms of the motion. I should be grateful if she were to come within them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take your advice, Sir Giles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a parallel case to that in Maastricht. The Minister suggests that Britain should be isolated on the matter and adhere to our own speed limits, while admitting the desirability of lowering speed limits elsewhere. Eleven other countries are ready to agree on speed limits below those that operate for the vehicles that we are discussing in Britain. That cannot be allowed to happen. It would be commercially impossible for our fleets of coaches, buses and lorries to run effectively if they could not cross the channel because they did not have speed limiters, or had speed limiters that were set to the maximum speed in Britain, which the proposals show would be higher than that in continental Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Harmonisation will come. If it must come, lower limits are desirable. We challenge the Government to prove to our partners in Europe that harmonisation, which the Government accept is inevitable, should be at a level higher than that proposed in the European directive. The Minister has failed to make that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood from one of the Minister's answers that the outcome at Maastricht, which Conservative Members regard as a triumph, was directly relevant to today's discussion and that article 75(1)(c) had been altered to include considerations of roadworthiness and safety. If Conservative Members regard that as a triumph, they should produce proposals similar to those of the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was involved in a television programme on road casualty reduction. The Committee will understand that it was worth trying to fit that in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms Ruddock) elegantly read paragraphs from the explanatory memorandum. However, her arguments lack consistency. She talked about different speed limits operating in different EC countries, but we have various speed limits in this one European nation. Speed limiters can affect a maximum speed only. The evidence is that the majority of crashes in Great Britain take place in built-up areas, with speed limits of 40 mph or below. It is different in Northern Ireland, where two thirds of crashes occur outside urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be looking for the sort of evidence that the Community normally produces before
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
considering such an issue. The Commission would never have put forward a technical specification for a speed limiter without evidence. In common with the hon. Member for Deptford, I refer the Committee to the explanatory memorandum, which states in paragraph 3 that in January 1989 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council directive but that it was chucked out because some member states objected to Community legislation on behavioural aspects of road safety. Paragraph 4 of the explanatory memorandum begins with the words: "It is obvious". However, the European Community does not base its regulations on statements of the obvious. It normally asks member states for evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Deptford declined to give way to me when I wanted to add to the helpful point made by the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike). The hon. Gentleman suggested that evidence from the other 11 European countries implied that a recommended speed limit would have particular results. I wanted to ask if I could be guided towards that evidence. I do not believe that it exists in an easily available form. I doubt whether it is available to the Community. I pay tribute to the people in the Community who work hard to reduce road casualties. They are intelligent, sensible people. However, I do not believe that the necessary evidence was available to them; if it had been it would have been included, at least as an appendix to the papers forwarded to each Community country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and Devon, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is good evidence to suggest that the fitting of seat belts on coaches, particularly on school buses, limits injuries. In that respect, Britain is at the forefront. Instead of trying to knock Britain's good record on road safety, the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms Ruddock) should take note of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Often it is the technical device that save lives. It is true that people sitting in exposed seats on coaches are in greater danger than those passengers jammed against the seat in front. It is the exposed seats to the right or left of the driver and the middle seat at the back that are the most dangerous. If coaches could be designed to carry the weight of heavier seats or so that the seats are fixed by seat belts, that would improve their safety, as my hon. Friend suggests. I am not talking about the eight-seater-plus minibuses, but the crew-type buses used by employers to ferry around their employees, where people sit side by side on a bench. They should be taken out of use immediately because of the health and safety considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to consider—I hope I am in order—the European Community's habit of dealing with such issues in a behavioural or a technical sense. The European Community requirement on drivers' hours goes far beyond the 48 hours that were recently proposed and which would have been accepted by the Labour party if it had been in government. Even on health and safety at work legislation, the Labour party is inconsistent. Its lack of regard for evidence is well-known. Perhaps that comes from being in opposition, but it may come from being the Labour

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not contradict the facts that suggest that the higher the speed, the greater the severity of the crash. I do not argue that we should not consider changing the speed limits, but it makes sense, if possible, to have the same speed limits throughout the Community. It would be desirable if such an agreement could be reached, but that should follow research and a discussion of the evidence. Such an agreement should not substitute such consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the unions representing drivers across Europe know about the proposal. If it was added to the directive in September, as the Minister said, there cannot have been time for other national Parliaments, or the unions or even the Economic and Social Committee—ECOSOC—to consider it. Employers are concerned about the health and safety of their employees. The vehicles are usually driven by professional drivers and their employers have a responsibility for health and safety at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a passing reference to Maastricht, the social charter and the social chapter. If they are tied to health and safety at work, how is it that our record on health and safety at work is the best in the European Community? One reason is that our roads are safer. The tripartite committee of ECOSOC, which matches our Health and Safety Commission, should discuss the issue. What is the point of the social dimension, about which we hear so much from the Labour party and some others in the European Community, if this issue, which affects trade unions and their members, has not been discussed seriously by ECOSOC? How can the Commission expect the Council of Ministers to approve it? We should challenge the proposal inoffensively, but directly. The EC should return to the agreement reached after the Gerondeau report, for which I praised Karl van Miert. It should work on the available evidence and not on its past knee-jerk reactions and those of the Labour party.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate. Let me reply to some of the points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Haywood) said that he favoured a commonality of speed limits across Europe and did not know why different heavy goods vehicles should have different maximum speeds. This proposal does not set a common maximum speed for HGVs on motorways in Europe; it does set a maximum, but lower speed limits will not be outlawed. It is a one-way ticket, as it were. Britain is out of line on maximum speed limits, but other countries can choose to have a lower speed limit. The issue raised by the motion is which forum should decide on speed limits—the House of Commons or the Commission and the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms Ruddock) says that her party proposes to put to the electorate at the general election that they should vote for Labour as Labour would then review speed limits. There is not much point in having that as a party proposal if it has been conceded already that speed limits should be decided not by the House of Commons, but by the European Commission. Nobody should want the Commission to decide on that without evidence. The point so eloquently made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) goes to the root of this. Britain has a good road safety record because it has taken a scientific rather than a knee-jerk approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the case that many other European countries have speed limiters fixed, are enforcing their domestic speed limits to promote domestic road safety and are then saying that they are anxious about vehicles from outside their borders speeding in contravention of their speed limits. Hardly any other countries have gone as far as we have in introducing speed limiters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government had the evidence that proved that the proposed reduction in speed limits would benefit the environment, encourage fuel consumption savings and reduce casualties, would they accept that a common European limit for those vehicles was desirable? Or, would they maintain what we believe to be a knee-jerk position—that Great Britain alone should decide its speed limits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be for each Parliament to decide its domestic speed limits. There is an argument for saying that there should be internationally set speed limiters for international transport. We must keep the matter in context. In 1990 the total road freight going out of the United Kingdom was 4,626 million metric tonnes, which is about the same as was coming in. That compares with the total freight lifted within the United Kingdom of 1,645 billion tonnes. That is a rough and ready calculation, but shows that about 1 per cent of the goods that we are talking about would be subject to international transport and the remainder would be domestic. The FTA and other bodies are sensitive about the implications of such a measure because it will have a dramatic impact on our freight operation and its cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is confusing us slightly in that he is drawing attention to speed limits, yet the proposals will not affect the ability of individual member states to set speed limits. The proposals deal only with the speed of the speed limiters. I accept that that is an important factor. By saying that individual nations could have speed limiters and, as a result, have lower speed limits, the Minister is throwing a red herring to confuse us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, the hon. Gentleman is right in that the Commission is arguing that the proposals have nothing to do with the right of individual nations to decide their speed limits and deal only with speed limiters. However, if a maximum speed were set for HGVs, it would be logical to have a speed limit that coincided with it. The implications of imposing a lower speed limit on coaches would be significant because they would be transferred from the outside lane. It would be wrong for coaches to continue travelling in the fast lane of motorways if the maximum speed at which they could travel was 62 mph. A conflict would then arise between those coaches and faster-moving vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

For those who are not lawyers, I wish to explain to the Opposition that, if the national speed limit were 70 mph and if the national speed limiter were set at a maximum of 60 mph, whether or not the speed limit was changed from 70 mph, the vehicle could not travel faster than 60 mph. The shadow Treasury team might not understand that either, but it is well understood by lorry drivers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals would not apply only to motorways. Various speed limits are imposed on different sections of roads. The Government have the power to change what are 50 mph-limit roads to 40 mph-limit roads.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall leave the matter where it is, because the argument has been won fairly and squarely by my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) and other hon. Friends.

We have no precise figures about how much limiters would cost the coach operators. Some rough estimates show that it would cost them about £6 million in terms of loss of time and productivity. Fuel savings would not be as great as that.

We must consider the effect of mode transfer as well as the effects of HGVs choosing to travel by different routes. It is difficult to come up with precise

details of such effects, as it is to commission research into the issue, given that we were given notice only in September that the proposal was due to go before the Transport Council in December.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the fuel savings figure would not be as great as the cost of loss of time and productivity. Will he tell us what the figure will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been estimated that the fuel savings might be around £4 million. That must be compared with the losses of £6 million in respect of loss of time and productivity.

I am grateful for the support of my hon. Friends the Members for Keighley (Mr. Waller) and for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan). They had the benefit of attending the Bus and Coach Council meeting last night and of receiving the overwhelming endorsement of that gathering for what the Government are proposing. My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley said that larger heavy goods vehicles result in increased productivity. That is true, and I am sure that it is something that the hon. Lady would accept. She would accept that as a result of increasing the weight of heavy goods vehicles from a maximum of 32 tonnes to a maximum of 38 tonnes there are some 13,000 fewer HGVs on the road. She would accept the logic that the proposal would necessarily bring about an increase in the number of HGVs to compensate for the lack of productivity which would be imposed by having a speed limit

lower than that which currently prevails on the motorways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that we anticipate a further increase in the weight of lorries. That would obviously have to be taken into account in making these calculations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have expressed their grave displeasure at the prospect of further increases in lorry weights but the only argument in favour is that there are fewer lorries on the roads. This proposal would result in more lorries on the roads yet the hon. Lady says she supports it. I hope that the Committee will adopt the recommendations in the motion and thereby give my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State a clear instruction for his negotiating position when he comes to the Transport Council next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
