	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Child Care</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this occasion to explain in more detail why the Government feel able to support the recommendation on childcare in principle. The recommendation is not legally binding. In negotiations in Brussels, we are seeking to ensure that the terms are not such that the Government are recommended to introduce legislation. This is a statement of the European Community's policy objectives in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendation is about ways of helping women with dependent children to take part in the labour market. That must always be a matter of individual choice for parents. For many employers, there are sound business reasons why it is sensible to consider how best to develop family-friendly personnel policies so that they recruit and retain good quality staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased that the recommendation recognises that there are several ways of helping parents reconcile work and family responsibilities. We also know that in the United Kingdom we have already done much on that front and we have something positive to contribute to the EC about good practice. For example in the public sector—the civil service and the national health service—we have a major programme designed to help the work force combine work and family responsibilities. We know that it makes sense to go for packages of arrangements. It is not simply a question of setting up a work place nursery and an employer then describing himself as family-friendly. It is a far more complex and subtle process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the general approach in the recommendation, but we have one major reservation which applies to three of the Articles—the wording of the introductory sentences for articles 3, 4, and 5. The terms seem to imply that the Government should introduce legislation. We could not support that. I am happy to say that in negotiations in Brussels, other member states shared our view that the recommendation should not be worded in that way. So we may now able to negotiate revised wording that we can accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four elements covered in the recommendation are child care, leave arrangements for employed parents, the organisation and structure of the work place, and sharing family responsibilities between men and women, Article 3, which deals with child care, seems generally to be on the same lines as Government policy. It talks about flexibility, diversity, parental and local community involvement as well as the quality of services. We have two reservations, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
Paragraph (a), uses the words, "this requires", before listing the main issues about patterns and access to child care. "This requires" is inappropriate language for a recommendation. Secondly, paragraph (c) recommends that public funding should make an essential contribution to child care. It is not for the EC to say anything about how we should spend taxpayers' money or about our priorities for public expenditure. We made those points during the negotiations and they were sympathetically received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4, which is on parental leave, poses problems, as its wording strongly implies that a statutory minimum of parental leave is required. Parental leave arrangements should remain a matter for employers and employees to decide in the light of their individual circumstances. A wide range of practices exists in this country, which could be jeopardised by the imposition of one set of arrangements by law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government play an important role in that area. First, we set an example of good practice in the public sector: both the civil service and the NHS have negotiated flexible leave arrangements and career break schemes. Secondly, we emphasise to employers that generous and flexible parental leave will enable them to recruit and retain able staff, and we publicise good practice in the private sector. We believe that that is the right way forward, and we shall be seeking changes to article 4 to make it compatible with our approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 deals with the work place. It recommends member states to
	<br><q><p>"encourage both sides of industry to promote action, 	<i>inter alia,</i> within the framework of collective agreements, to make the environment, structure and organisation of individual workplaces supportive of the needs of all working parents".</p></q>
Examples of good practice that are cited in the Commission's explanatory memorandum are the hours at which meetings are held to avoid incompatibility with the need to collect children from creches, the importance of giving adequate notice of the need to travel and the need for flexible working hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government take every opportunity to encourage employers to adopt a flexible approach to working arrangements. In July 1991 the Secretary of State for Employment published a good practice guide, "The Best of Both Worlds", illustrating the benefits of a variety of flexible arrangements for employers and employees. The Government, therefore, support the broad thrust of article 5. We accept that we have a role to play in raising awareness but, at the same time, believe that it must be for both sides of industry to agree such matters between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are opposed to paragraph (b) in the article, which singles out people working in child care services as requiring special consideration. It is unacceptable for the EC in a recommendation to do that. We know that research findings suggest that poor terms and conditions of employment affect the quality of child care services. It is, therefore, reasonable for providers and those responsible for regulating private and voluntary provision to pay attention to this issue. The Government should not be involved in any way, except to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
establish the framework for the quality of child care, which has to be registered under the Children Act 1989. Volume 2 of the guidance spells that out in some detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 recommends member states to stimulate initiatives to encourage men to play a greater part in family life. That causes us some anxiety. It is highly intrusive for Government to intervene in parents' arrangements for reconciling work and family responsibilities. It is also not practicable. Nevertheless, no one would disagree with the general principle of more equal sharing of domestic and family responsibilities between men and women. Negotiations in Brussels suggest that other member states recognise the ethical and practical difficulties that the article poses. We therefore hope to resolve the problem in a way that we can accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion we want to be able to sign the recommendation, but that is provided that we negotiate changes to the text which meet our anxieties. It deals with a matter about which the Government have been active. We recognise the general need for all who are involved—employers in the statutory, private and voluntary sectors, employees, parents and statutory authorities concerned about the quality of child care and services—to work together to ensure good practice and sensible development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first European Standing Committee that I have attended, so I shall need your guidance, Mr. Lamond, from time to time to ensure that I am following the correct procedure. I believe that I can now ask questions of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is your question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that she thought that the Government would accept the recommendation when it is put to the Council of Ministers next Tuesday. What concessions have already been negotiated, which are not before the Committee? We need to know what the Government will be accepting next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will submit a motion. The Government appear to believe that the recommendation does not support the principle of parental choice or the sufficient involvement of the public or private sectors. However, the recommendation makes it clear that the EC Commission is asking the public sector not to make all the provision but to ensure that all provision is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government appear to be denying their responsibility for ensuring that there is a comprehensive network throughout the country by which families have access to affordable child-care that is appropriate to family needs and is of the necessary quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendation also discusses family leave and the need for employment provisions to ensure that parents—male and female—can work or train and act as parents. I am worried that the Government still argue that no legislative back-up to minimum good standards is necessary. Many women, in particular, cannot negotiate with their employers. I shall not dis-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
cuss why that is so because that issue is not before the Committee today. However, it means that many women are simply unable to take up full-time employment because it does not offer them the flexibility that they need to fulfil their responsibilities as parents. Why do the Government refuse to introduce in employment regulations minimum basic standards for parental leave and the other issues raised in the document before us? I suspect that I have stretched my one question a little far, Mr. Lamond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that other members of the Committee know that I asked for one question to give other hon. Members the opportunity to ask a question. If there is time, hon. Members can come back to ask second questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several matters have been raised. I cannot give the hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms. Armstrong) precise answers to questions about the modifications that are being negotiated because they are still subject to discussion. We have made our position clear in the explanatory memorandum. Essentially, it is to soften some of the language so that there is no misunderstanding that this would be a recommendation, not a binding measure. The principles of the proposed recommendation are very much in line with Government thinking. I imagine that the point of disagreement between the Government and the hon. Lady rests on the extent to which the state might dictate precise aspects of how people live their lives and the requirements and burdens placed on employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are second to none in their energetic pursuit of enlightened employment practices. As will be appreciated, I am involved in an organisation that employs more women than any other organisation not only in this country but probably worldwide. As you know, Mr. Lamond, we argue that only the Red Army and the Indian railway employ more women than the national health service, and neither is noted for its number of female employees. We recently produced a new good practice handbook on women in the NHS. I am extremely proud of the measures that we are already taking. We have introduced great flexibility into parental leave for family reasons, for reasons of adoption, and so on. Our career-break initiatives bear comparison with any of the front leaders in other sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not accept that because we do not recognise that it is right to have statutory controls on these issues, there should be any misunderstanding about our full-blooded commitment, as an enlightened employer, to ensure that such steps are among the first considered. Indeed, that is a matter of enlightened self-interest for an employer. Although such matters are discussed in the European Community in terms of equal opportunities, the first step of an enlightened employer is to realise that, if virtually half the work force are women, there is an extra premium on training them. Therefore, it is even more important to hold on to the women for whom we are responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady spoke about the Government's views on further regulation of child care. The Children Act
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
1989 introduced, for the first time, binding regulations for the quality of child care. The Children Act 1989 guidance and regulations volume 2, "Family Support, Day Care", and "Education Provision for Young Children" gives the framework of legislation and control for day care. Some argue that we have been too stringent, but there is a balance of judgment there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proof of the pudding is in the eating. There has been the most remarkable increase in day care in recent years. Places in registered day nurseries have more than doubled in three years; similarly, places with registered child minders have increased by 40 percent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect of the Children Act that is material to the proposed recommendation is the duty on local social services and education authorities to review child care provision in their area. We seek a partnership between not only social services and health authorities but the other partners in child care—parents, employers and the voluntary organisations which play such an important role in our child care. We hope that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Employment will be able to support the proposed recommendation at the Council of Ministers on Tuesday, but it is not possible to give details about the progress of the negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's exposition. I have two questions. Shall I ask them consecutively, Mr. Lamond, or shall I ask one now and the other later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just ask them together, but briefly please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister made three comments. First, she said that this country has a good record and we are doing what is proposed anyway. I am happy to accept that. Secondly, she said that suggestions about how people might re-order their family lives might be intrusive and inappropriate to pursue. Thirdly, she said that a recommendation which could imply that member states should change their existing regulations, or introduce new legislation, was inappropriate because the Community should have no competence in this area. I agree with that, too. If we accept those three elements, what is the point, first, of this highly elaborate, expensive, bureaucratic exercise which produces so much paperwork, and, secondly, highly paid civil servants working in their offices in Brussels for perhaps months on end to produce recommendations which are, by the Minister's account, at best platitudinous and at worst otiose because they will not affect the way people act or behave or the way Governments change rules?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's comments, especially his commendation of our good record. It is significant that in the European Community statistics on child care the figure given always refers to publicly funded child care. Yet, when we examine the section on all forms of group activity for children—when my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment discussed the mat-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
ter with this Committee on 27 March this figure was 87 per cent—we find that now between 90 per cent and 95 per cent of three and four-year-olds are involved in some form of group activity. The Community figures edit out playgroups which make such an important contribution. They are not recognised or considered to be of great value, although we consider this approach extremely important for training and for supporting and encouraging parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are happy to co-operate with the proposed recommendation because we can argue that no other European Community country, except perhaps Denmark, has a better record on the employment of women. We have one of the highest participation rates of women in the work force. Thirty per cent of the further increase in women in the work force in recent years has taken place in this country. Our pragmatic and sensible approach to such questions, which has delivered results because so many women are able to participate in the work force, makes it right and proper for us to support the proposed recommendation. We do so by means of the voluntary approach, by good practice and by trying to keep the clammy hand of the state out of the workplace as much as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. I owe the Committee an apology, because my question was not expressed very well and was not understood. I did not receive an answer to my question—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order. I cannot insist that any hon. Member answers a question. I thought that the hon. Gentleman asked a good question, but whether he is satisfied is not a point of order for me. He may have a chance to return to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What amendments, if any, were suggested by the Economic and Social Council following their consultations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum states:
	<br><q><p>"There is already a wide range of developments in childcare services and leave arrangements in the UK, which could be adversely affected by the imposition of statutory arrangements."</p></q>
Will the Minister expand on that and explain the reason for including the words "could be", and what adverse effects there could be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised at the title of the proposed recommendation, which covers not only child care but matters such as leave arrangements for parents. I was also surprised that the Government seem prepared to accept the recommendation—in view of their well-known hostility to the parental leave directive. Perhaps the Minister will reconcile those two apparently conflicting positions—or do the Government feel that a recommendation need not be implemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am becoming agitated about the tone of that question, which shows total misunderstanding of our approach. The developments in this country—for example, on career breaks—are impressive. We recently negotiated a maternity leave
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
arrangement in the national health service that exceeds the best of those developed in many other areas. Many organisations offer women a wide range of flexible options and other career breaks of as long as five years with the opportunity to return to work. A restrictive and prescriptive approach could easily undermine the practical bottom-up development that is taking place. Women form almost half the work force, and we must use their contribution to the full. Forward-thinking employers are working on that basis not because of a directive, but because they know that their ability to provide a high quality service depends on their ability to recruit and to retain high quality staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about ECOSOC and the European Parliament. I am concerned that some of the papers on the recommendation have taken time to reach the various institutions, partly because of industrial action in the Commission's office during the summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament gave an opinion on 22 November that amounted to 19 pages, and it has not yet been possible fully to study it. It will go to the Commission. Some of the points raised would make the matter more restrictive, directed, and binding. We support the recommendation because it has moral force but does not prepare the way for binding directives. Our negotiations about the recommendations are conducted on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister put the case well, explaining what can be done in the United Kingdom to improve child care. However, I am worried about the question asked earlier, on the force that the recommendations will have in bringing about legislation. The proposal goes into such detail, and suggests that at some stage we would be committed to introducing legislation or guidance relating to the recommendations. The document says that inadequate information is available on several issues. It is surely cause for anxiety, that we are drawing up an agreement based on inadequate information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that as a recommendation, it does not have binding force. We shall seek to ensure that the language or the recommendation, which generally requires careful consideration, leaves no doubt. Being a recommendation 	<i>per se</i> is not sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It remains the case that under the treaty, the European Community proposes activity on vocational training and equal opprtunities. We recognise that the recommendation has bearing and weight, but I re-emphasise our view that it does not amount to making further binding regulations. We have shown that we have a contribution to make; this country has a good record on child care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I offer my compliments to the Minister and to her officials for the timeous delivery of the huge wad of probably less than useful documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 8 of the explanatory memorandum mentions the Children Act 1989, and Scotland is also mentioned in that context. There is a growing unevenness in child care law within the United Kingdom. I regret
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
that Scotland's lead in child care has slipped away. With the passing of the Children Act 1989 and the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which deals with the protection of children giving evidence in child sexual abuse cases, Scotland is now lagging far behind English developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10 of the explanatory memorandum asserts confidently that the Dutch presidency aims to agree the recommendation at the Council meeting next week. What is the Minister's view on that? Will the Dutch fall into line, or is this yet another example of subsidiarity at work in the EC? Subsidiarity defines decision making at the highest level. It is becoming an increasingly worthless concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard the Minister's somewhat boastful comments about the number of women employed in the national health service. However, in Scotland, though many women are employed in the NHS, very few are to be found as consultants outwith gynaecology and psychiatry. I challenge the Minister to refute my statement. The same applies to hospital administration, in which few women are employed in senior positions. It may be that England is in the lead. I am happy for England to go its own way. However, I wanted to add my reservations to the Minister's remarks about women in the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond to the hon. Gentleman. He and I have discussed child care on several occasions, and I respect his comments. I am grateful to him for his recognition of the significance of the Children Act 1989, which presented a major legislative opportunity to bring together the laws relating to children. That complex Act has wide implications, including child care and women at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will draw the hon. Gentleman's remarks to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland. I had assumed that children's hearings north of the border had much to offer, so I was saddened to hear the hon. Gentleman's comments. I have been following the debate about children's education, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will consider points that have been made in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is made clear in paragraph 10 of the explanatory memorandum, we hope to agree to the recommendation, as will the Dutch presidency. However, if the hon. Gentleman's doubts prove to be well-founded and my judgment to be faulty, we might have another word together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's comments about women in the health service are important, because there have been, and will be, great changes in it. There are still not enough women employed in many cases. There has been a significant increase in the number of women in the House, but it is still a paltry number. There were 23 women Members of Parliament when I was elected, and there are now 44. None of us believes that is anything like good enough. Similarly in the health service. For example, in 1979 one in seven general practitioners were women, but in 1990 the ratio is one to four, which is a dramatic improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned consultants, who spend years as junior hospital doctors. We are determined to end that unacceptable way of training juniors.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
which will have a big impact on women. There are equal numbers of men and women at medical school, and the girls do better than the boys in many junior grades. We lose women at the registrar grade, which is when some of them want to begin raising a family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our practical steps to help the health service—as opposed to those that we are required to take by the European Community—include quadrupling the number of part-time registrar posts, and we have started a women in surgical training initiative, which involves a befriending scheme to suport women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we encourage more women to become consultant surgeons, we shall have tackled one of the most difficult problems. In the 10 years or so that we have been in office, we have not changed completely the structure in which consultants work. We must ensure that women are used to the full under flexible arrangements which is crucial for them to continue in that line of work. The most effective way of advocating our case is to say that we are determined to press the matter further in the national health service. I could let the hon. Gentleman have a copy of our new handbook of good practice on women in the NHS. We should use our work force to their maximum possible effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for providing us with the documentation, although I have not yet had time to read it all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider carefully paragraph (1) of the explanatory memorandum. The European Commission appears to want to transform family life in this country. For example, it suggests that the state should be involved in deciding how to share family responsibilities between men and women who have children, and that it should provide universal child care for all. That would be extraordinarily expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it now Government policy—the policy of my party, the Conservative party—to do that on behalf of the public? If not, why should we accept the recommendation? Surely, judging by previous experience, if we do, it will ultimately lead to a directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) and, indeed, the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) for their comments about the hard work of the excellent officials in the Department of Health with some assistance from the Department of Employment. I am pleased to support those comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's remarks, on the content of paragraph 8 on page 5 of the explanatory memorandum, raise questions that I appreciate. My right hon. Friend the chairman of the ministerial group on women's issues—who does an excellent job at the Home Office in carrying forward such issues—speaks frequently on the importance of a better balance of responsibilities as between men and women and increased participation by men. That is an important issue—it involves changing the climate of opinion and taking forward that campaign. I know that my right hon. Friend is extremely content for that paragraph to be supported. However, it is important to recognise that it is for the individual to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Occasionally, I have reservations about comments on that subject—some of them from the Commission. A recent survey showed that 71 per cent of women who work part time want to do so. I recollect that 6 per cent said that they would like to work full time. I would not support a programme that coerced women to go out to work rather than recognising and respecting those who decide, when they have young families, to combine their domestic and professional responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many women—in my view, wisely so—want to put their careers on the back burner when they have a young family on the basis that, as their families grow older, they can bring their careers forward. They do not want to be marginalised as part-time workers. We must do more to offer part-time workers training opportunities, professional development, and the opportunity to reconsider their commitment. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport made an important observation when he urged caution, and he spoke of the dangers of becoming over-prescriptive and somewhat didactic about how such patterns should be achieved. It really is a matter for the individuals themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer my hon. Friend the Minister to article 6. I wonder whether she wqas a little hard on that matter, which follows on from one or two of the other questions that were raised. Can my hon. Friend explain the difference between "promote and encourage" in article 6, and "develop measures" in article 1?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Family life is changing in response to a growing number of women in the work force, which inevitably has consequences for the men who share those households. As a young father, I know that to be so. Surely promotion and encouragement of that fact cannot be bad—campaigning to explain to men who grew up against traditional backgrounds and who do not appreciate that life has changed, that life for a women in part-time or full-time work is difficult when she must also manage household affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it would not be wrong to spend time and effort in helping different agencies to explain such facts, so that changes take place. That would not be too prescriptive. The Commission is not directing our country to take any special steps of enforcement. To "promote and encourage" would seem the right approach. I hope that my hon. Friend recognises the distinction between that and "development measures".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always have to suppress a note of levity when right and hon. Members discuss such issues, because, of all the socially unacceptable husbands and wives and mothers and fathers, it would be hard to find a more representative group. Perhaps others should take my advice and ensure that they co-exist with their spouse at their place of work. My hon. Friend's comments are a response to the alternative emphasis of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "developing measures" is too often a euphemism for developing binding measures and introducing directives. We do not consider it appropriate, in terms of the principle of subsidiarity which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) raised, for the European Community to dictate on those issues. However, promoting and encouraging is quite another matter—it is the force of the recommendation that it is morally binding, which is why we are happy to support it. We do not want misunderstandings, and the use of such terms as "develop measures" so often leads to misunderstanding as to what precisely we committed ourselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) appears a less than enthusiastic federalist. We are attempting to determine whether these measures can become law. The explanatory memorandum rightly states, under the heading "Impact on United Kingdom Law":
	<br><q><p>"The proposal has no direct legislative force. However, the use of the term "develop measures" could be interpreted to include legislation among the actions expected of member states."</p></q>
The European Court of Justice appears to be a supreme court in every sense of the word, as regards the English and Scottish legal systems and those of the 11 other nations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke earlier of subsidiarity. If patterns of what might be termed good practice in child care law varied so widely among member states of the European Community, might not complaints against individuals in a country that, in the opinion, of the complainers, had less than acceptable child care arrangements eventually reach the European Court of Justice—whether or not the recommendation attained the status of a directive? Surely the point at issue is good practice, and the range of practices throughout the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not qualified to judge how such a matter could develop in such circumstances. However, there is such enormous diversity in child care that comparisons are difficult to make. For example, the United Kingdom has one of the earliest school starting ages and, once children start daily compulsory education, they stay at school until at least 3.30 pm. In many continental countries, children finish school at lunchtime, which poses enormous difficulties for working women. I cannot imagine how they manage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My area of dissatisfaction is that we have not always been able to explain the strengths of our system. Many EC countries advocate a rather monolithic form of municipal child care. They believe that providing publicly funded nurseries is the best response, but I challenge that. One of our strengths is child minders. They are far more flexible and domestic, and they offer greater continuity. The child does not have to change his or her child minder when going to school, and can continue to go to the minder in the holidays and if the mother changes her work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to reflect in child care provision the diversity and different traditions of the local environment. We should develop the ability to compare different patterns more effectively. That has merit, and it would register the strength of our system. It is a remarkable achievement when 90 to 95 per cent. of our three and four-year-olds are involved in some form of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
group activity—and I am concerned that is not more widely recognised or appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly there is scope for other forms of day care. I am proud to say that half our health authorities offer some form of child care facilities. We have seen dramatic and fast expansion in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions arising out of the points raised by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow. I hope to elicit a proper answer, so I shall endeavour to them as precisely as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, is the proposed recommendation justiciable, or could it be? Could it be prayed in aid before the European Court of Justice if a challenge were made to relevant social legislation passed by any member state?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as my hon. Friend the Minister is aware, there is on the table for the Maastricht summit a draft treaty for political union, that contains a subsidiarity clause. If this country became part to a treaty containing such a clause, would subsidiarity either accommodate or preclude initiatives of the kind that we are dealing with now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important point is that this is only a recommendation on a subject that is already the subject of long-standing, pre-existing activity by the European Community. There have been a number of measures on equal opportunities and vocational training. As my hon. Friend knows, the recommendation arises not from the first or second, but third social action programme on equal opportunities, which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Employment described to the Committee in March. So the recommendation sets no new precedent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could it be prayed in aid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be rash for me to say that any recommendation will not be prayed in aid at a later date. However, I reassure my hon. Friend that it is not a binding matter, and that it is not our intention that it should lead to further legislation. It is simply recognition of what Government policy is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can also give my hon. Friend the assurance that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Employment will not agree to the recommendation next Tuesday if he has doubts about the issues that my hon. Friend raised. I shall certainly draw my right hon. and learned Friend's attention to that precise problem and to my hon. Friend's anxieties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished at the Minister's complacency about the choices available to parents in this country. She cannot have listened to the many people who have talked to me—and I know to her—about totally inadequate provision in some areas. A high number of children are in collective care because parents are desperate to create some opportunities for their children and are themselves organising playgroups—but children often have an opportunity to attend them only two hours a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Minister say that parents can make choices about the pattern of family life that they want,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
when in some parts of the country access to affordable day care is beyond their means?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister accept that, although one survey stated that women want to work part-time, it revealed also that the majority of women want flexible, full-day child care, so that they could make choices at appropriate times in the interests of their children? Does she accept that, unless such an opportunity is provided, they cannot make that choice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman), so will she now explain how a recommendation would deter employers from pursuing good practice? Surely it would give them a framework that they could develop even further. It seems that the only responsibility that the Government accept is their responsibility as an employer. Do they not accept that they have a responsibility to set down a framework and to take the lead—so that employers, parents, and children know that they will have the best opportunities? Employers as well as parents have been pressing the issue strongly, and they are looking for a lead from the Government that, as yet, they have not been given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are taking a strong lead on the issue. The directive is not binding. I do not think that the hon. Lady meant to suggest that I claimed that a recommendation would damage good practice—but a binding measures could. We support the recommendation because it reinforces Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Employment has been pressing both sides of industry to recognise the importance of the issue. There is every reason for referring to the experience of the health service because it is the largest employer in the country, and it is engaged in a vigorous campaign to ensure that enlightened, responsible, and good practice is adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only the health service is involved, but many other organisations are working with the Government to ensure that there are further developments. For example, I refer the hon. Lady to the work undertaken by Business in the Community, Confederation of British Industry, and Trade Union Congress. The other day I visited Elida Gibbs in Leeds, which operates a practical scheme together with the local authority. Elida Gibbs has taken on a registration officer from the local authority, who co-ordinates the company's child minders. I am pleased that the Automobile Association in Basingstoke operates a similar scheme, as does Thanet health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By promoting such initiatives, schemes can be developed that meet the needs of mothers, employers, and children. I emphasise that I would not support measures that did not properly recognise the need for safe care. The hon. Member for Durham, North-West implied that the Government take a passive approach in the context of the Children Act 1989. I do not know whether she has read volume 2 of the guidance and regulations relating to that Act, but I will send them to her, so that she can consider carefully the binding regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
I chair an interdepartmental committee that considers provision for the under-fives. It comprises representatives from not only my Department, but the Department of Employment, Department of Education and Science, Home Office, and Ministry of Defence—which has responsibility for children overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention also to voluntary organisations because of their extremely valuable work. Under the Children Act 1989, we have funded a range of training material and good practice guidance, notably work with the National Children's Bureau on local authority registration and inspection, which is a catalyst. It not only maintains high quality but contributes to the review function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Lady, if she is arguing that we need to do more. We must develop and encourage child care facilities that respond to local needs and employment circumstances. Progress will be made through a willing partnership between employers, parents, local authorities, and voluntary organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend the Minister confirm that if the European Trade Unions and the European Employers Federation are able to make joint statements on such issues, we should not think that it is bad to consider the need to reconcile general work responsibilities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good to see that the European Commission is beginning to operate in the way that I advocated when I was a junior Minister at the Department of Employment in 1985—on recommendations rather than on binding regulations, in areas where cultural and historic developments come together because people choose to bring them together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although common sense is now operating in the Commission, a committee in the European Parliament is endeavouring to set up directives in this area—which my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport is rightly resisting. Could my hon. Friend the Minister suggest that the European Community consider having the framework for cohort studies which, could show the experience of mothers and fathers at work and of children throughout the Community? Each country could introduce its own emphasis in such studies, but at least we would be working on fact rather than on fiction, fantasy, or nightmares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that there is a social dimension to the internal market? If so, how will it best be safeguarded? Can that be done by recommendations? Are not directives necessary to ensure that employment rights are in harmony? Although the principle of subsidiarity has been mentioned, I cannot understand why the social dimension should be put in a different category from everything else. If the internal market is to work satisfactorily, it will have to include that social dimension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What consultation has the Minister had with industry and local authorities about the implementation of the recommendation? Consultation would help to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
avoid the problem of patchy provision throughout the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows that the Government's policy on the social dimension of the internal market and the European Community has not changed. We accept that social considerations should apply, as long as they do not undermine the ability to create jobs and do not generate excessive costs for employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons we were unable to support the social charter. Different cultural patterns should be taken into consideration, and respect must be shown to questions of subsidiarity. Those important safeguards sometimes lead to difficulties. There is a growing consensus on that matter, and I hope that we shall be able to support recommendations knowing that we do so within this framework, which is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not been involved in consultations with local authorities and industry. Time has been limited. Essentially, consultations is in the mainstream of regular discussions. I meet local authority associations and the directors of social services every quarter and discuss legislation that concerns us. I have taken particular interest in the matter because I have responsibility under the Children Act 1989 and for carrying forward the women in the national health service initiative. I am also co-chairman of the Women's National Commission, so I hear the voices of a great range of women's organisations that feed their comments and contributions to that commission. I have sought to carry forward policies that recognised that partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were times when local authorities were rather prescriptive and less co-operative in relation to private sector developments and initiatives. On other occasions, the independent or voluntary groups were not fully co-operating with local authorities. With regard to implementing the Children Act 1989 and its review function, that work within partnerships is central and extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have attended a great number of events, some of which have been organised by the Department of Health and some by others, at which we have sought to bring those partners together. I have attended numerous events with Rita Stringfellow, Gillian Pugh from the National Children's Bureau and people from the employers' side. I am sure that the review function under the Children Act 1989 is important for reviewing, publishing and planning in relation to local communities and, above all, for ensuring that information is available because women often do not know what is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one would deny that child care is costly and time consuming. The reason why mothers were at home in years gone by was because they were responsible for their families and children and for running their household. It is not possible to achieve a quick-fix solution, but I am extremely encouraged by the phenomenal expansion in day nurseries. They have doubled in three years and there has been a great increase in the numbers of child minders. I want to ensure that we can improve on those developments and direct our concern to areas which need special help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
	<p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 7485/91 on child care; and supports the Government's view that the terms of the Recommendation are welcome in principle, subject to detailed changes to improve the text to ensure adequate recognition of the principle of parental choice and the involvement of the private and voluntary sectors, and to ensure that the wide range of developments in childcare services, leave and other arrangements, for employed parents are not adversely affected by the imposition of statutory arrangements.—[	<i>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley.</i>]</p>
	<p>11.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Hilary Armstrong 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Durham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support the recommendation although the Government are, again, trying to water it down so that it will have no impact on their view of developments in this country. None the less, we want to ensure that child care is recognised as an important part of social provisions in the movement towards a single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendation refers especially to the children of working parents and the need for parents to he fully involved in the work place and in training, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
is particularly important for women. It makes it clear that the Commission seeks to provide for all children, so that the children of working parents are not segregated from other children. First and foremost, it recognises children's needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Committee stage of the Children Bill, I pressed hard for the Government to include training in the provisions for which local authorities had competence. Initially the Government resisted that and I was pleased when they accepted the proposition. The Opposition pressed for a review and it became a central part of the section of the Children Act 1989 that deals with the registration and regulation of child care. The Government have a prime responsibility not to provide child care, but to facilitate it. We are anxious because, despite what the Minister said, the Government have largely left that to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I meet employers on a weekly basis and recently I saw people in Business in the Community who deal with child care. I spoke at a conference in Portsmouth a week ago in which BIC was involved. People in BIC are anxious that there should be public involvement in the partnership. It should not be a matter of "get on and do it". In many parts of the country, the role of the public sector is critical in drawing in employers to provide quality child care that parents can afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned people such as Rita String-fellow, who was instrumental in establishing the child care enterprise on north Tyneside developed by the local authority. Public money has been provided by the Government, through the Departments of Employment and Trade and Industry, and by the local authority. Quality child care has revolutionised the confidence felt by employees at their work, and the ability of employers to retain employees and ensure that they have a proper career structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme in Leeds that the Minister mentioned got off the ground because the local authority had worked long and hard at its contribution to child care. Leeds has a reputation, despite threats of rate capping and so on, of struggling to ensure that a variety of quality child care is offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is naive if she thinks that that can happen without the determination of politicians and central Government. Through BIC and independently, employers are saying that they need a framework that does not simply leave everything to them. They recognise the value of work place nurseries, but they are anxious that their employees may not want such nurseries. Employers acknowledge that they are not experts in good quality child care, and they want to work with the public and voluntary sectors to develop that structure. Without a public commitment from the Government to assist those programmes, development will be patchy. In an area that I visited last week there is little nursery education and the pattern of child care around that education is patchy. Parents are concerned about quality because they know that a quality educational experience for three and four-year-olds is vital to enable them to take full advantage of their later schooling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party will not oppose the recommendation, but we wish that, instead of trying to pare down all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
the recommendations to the bare minimum, the Government would try to be part of the best practise and share that best practice. The Minister tells us that 93 per cent of three and four-year-olds are in some form of collective care, but she and their parents know that for many of those children the extent of their involvement in any week is so minimal that it does not meet the needs of the children or their families. We cannot afford to be complacent. Parents' demands and their frustration have been ignored by the Minister this morning. She knows the strength of parents frustration, becuase the people who come to see me also go to see her. To date, I have not been able to reassure them that the situation will improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be good if the Government would commit themselves to developing nursery education. We have been told this year by the Secretary of State for Education and Science that that is no longer a priority. It would be helpful if the Government would take a lead and recognise their responsibilities, rather than merely acknowledge that child care is a good thing and tell others to do it. They should bring people together and, where necessary, pump prime the development, so that the partnership can get off the ground and offer opportunities to children and parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendation suggests some important ways forward. It has been developed from the work of the European Child Care Network, through which comparisons have been made, country by country. The report on the United Kingdom by Bronwen Cohen and the update last year were written in terms that allowed comparison with other European countries and outlined the framework that should be developed in Britain.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but when I attended the executive seminar on family policy, which was linked to the European Community initiatives and organised by Luxembourg during its presidency, no one had information that members of the academic community present regarded as robust. There is a desperate need for proper information and for apparently irreconcilable elements to be resolved, so that we can at least work with common facts. The hon. Lady is right to say that if we get down to basics, with the Government playing their proper role, it will be possible for more initiatives to blossom into flower, but merely to pursue a blanket hardening of the recommendation is not the way to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that such a policy would achieve that. It would set the framework and establish the commitment of the Government to fulfil the recommendation. We need more monitoring and research. We have asked the Government to monitor more carefully the Children Act 1989 and to work more positively with our European partners to develop research that can demonstrate what is valuable and what works.

one in the voluntary sector, no employer and no private provider whom I have met believes that. Such people are looking to the Government for a much clearer lead and commitment to develop a framework. The recommendation provides the framework within which we can achieve the opportunity for children that the Minister and I desire. We want the best quality of opportunity for children. That will come about not by accident or good will, but by the Government's determination to respond to society's needs and requests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the recommendation and hope that the Government recognise that it is a call for action rather than a chance to pat everyone on the head and assert that everything is fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply grateful to you, Mr. Lamond, for calling me now, as I know that many other Conservative Members wish to speak. It is particularly kind of you because, as you are aware, I am also serving on the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. In deference to you, Mr. Lamond, I shall make a short contribution, which might be termed a long question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support proposals to improve or create new child care arrangements. The education of three and four-year-olds is important and the more that can be done to develop it, the better. In the Earl Shilton and Hinckley area of my Leicestershire constituency there has been controversy about which children can attend school before the age of five. I am constantly preoccupied with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House of Commons should be taking a lead in this matter and I regret that it does not have proper child care facilities. My hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) has been particularly assiduous in trying to obtain creche facilities and other facilities for young children here. I am sure that the hon. Members for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) and for Durham, North-West (Ms. Armstrong) support the idea of better facilities for children in the House of Commons. We should be setting an example.

I have two young children aged four and two and if they wake up in the middle of the night I am very happy to see to them and let my wife get some sleep—we work a sort of alternate arrangement. A few years ago, that might have been considered an immasculine—if there is such a word—way of behaving. I think that it bonds one to one's children and I am happy to do it. However, I am not happy about being directed by the Commission on how I should run my family at home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a direction. However, does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the pattern of family life is now determined, certainly for women, by the way in which legislation has already operated? The fact that we have nothing like adequate child care has as directional an effect on many women as this measure, which the hon. Gentleman is complaining about would have on men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for trying to help me in my contribution, and there is some merit in her remarks There is a place for legislation for example, to improve education facilities for young children. There is great scope for amending the tax regime so that rebates are available for women who want to stay at home and look after their children, because they make a valuable contribution to society. I think that it results in cuts in the crime rate and related issues that we do not have time to debate. Indeed, I might be called to order for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is beyond the scope of the legal framework that we should receive direction on how we manage our households—indeed, I find it repugnant. It flies in the face of the principle of subsidiarity, about which we have recently heard much discussion. If there is to be genuine subsidiarity, we must ensure that officials far away do not interfere with what happens in the home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to safeguard the rights of families to decide how they should run their homes. I welcome the idea of increasing the facilities available for mothers and families and, in particular, improving education facilities for young children.

I believe that most people will welcome the general recommendation as a step in the right directdion and wish for a comprehensive view of child care as parents require it in trying to reconcile their employment and domestic responsibilities. However, page 3 of the explanatory memorandum states:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
	<br><q><p>"information on the private sector is more sketchy"</p></q>
and page 5 refers to "major gaps in information". Paragraph 9 states:
	<br><q><p>"Information on privately funded childcare services is generally inadequate".</p></q>
Paragraph 2 on page 9 reiterates that
	<br><q><p>"their are major gaps of information".</p></q>
This is not the first time that this subject has been discussed in Committee. We discussed similar measures in March. There appears to have been inadequate consultation in the Commission before it put forward measures for the sovereign states to discuss and take action on. The Commission is asking us to accept a recommendation—my hon. Friend the Minister said that it would not lead directly to legislation and I hope that that is right—on which there has been inadequate consultation and only an inadequate attempt made to obtain information before reaching a conclusion. That is a sure way to make the recommendation unworkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been criticised from time to time for not doing their homework before they introduce legislation. I am sure that the same criticisms were made of previous Governments. The recommendation will have a wide effect on every Community state—Denmark is the only one that has reached a level close to that outlined in the recommendation—yet the Commission is saying that it does not have enough information. That is not a sound basis on which to make recommendations to this country or any other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister made the point clearly to the Commission that while we would accept the recommendation, on the terms that my hon. Friend outlined, there must be greater investigation and analysis before more recommendations or directives are introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to recognise that if this debate had been about an issue that affected trade unions, we should have had many more Labour Members present. I pay tribute to the two Labour Members who are present. The absence of others has been noted. They would be present for any debate that affected the man at work. I do not include the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) in my comments. I am not attacking anyone, but I am trying to explain that if this had been a trade union issue, there would have been many more Labour Members here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To balance my opening remarks, I recognise that the reason why some Conservative Members are calling for more child care facilities in the House of Commons is that more of them now have young children. It is an interesting comment on the male-centredness of most politics, whether British, European or trade union, that when Members have personal experience of a matter, they begin to understand the situations of ordinary people that many others have been describing for years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms. Armstrong), who spoke for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Opposition. She made it plain that there is no room for complacency and a great need for more provision, perhaps in the House, but certainly for those who are not Members of Parliament and have many fewer choices.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister reminds me, my wife and I have a friend who thanks his first wife for all the help that she has given him. Most of us think that they have been married for ever, and they have. He describes her as his first wife only to encourage her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work done by the Child Poverty Action Group in the early 1970s into the circumstances of mothers in the lowest-income families showed that many of those mothers had to go out to earn money because they did not have enough. That is why child benefit is relevant—although it would be better described as child allowance—because it recognises extra needs and lower taxable capacities. It is right to pay it in cash to those who have dependent children. There are a number of people who believe that it is right for them to go out to work because that is the best that they can do for their children. We should try to relieve that pressure. In some cases, it would be better for people to have fewer material resources and to be able to give more time to their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a remarkable intervention in a debate before she became a Minister, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mrs. Rumbold) said that she was fed up with male Members of Parliament telling women what to do with their bodies or their time. That could change if we found a way, for the House to achieve some of the aims of the 300 Group and get many more women, on merit, into Parliament. That would help to bring out the better side of some of the men who are already here. These debates would not just consist of the Labour party accusing the Conservatives of saying that everthing is all right which we are not doing. But I leave that to my hon. Friend the Minister to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should try to bring the family perspective and the family lifecycle into social and economic policies. Family policy is not about telling people what to believe or what to do with their bodies but about how to stand on their own feet and trying to provide more opportunities for others during the family lifecycle itself. Some of that relates to issues outside the competence of the Committee and of the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
The EC is beginning to show some attention to the issues that I raised in a debate in the House in 1982 on family policy. What practical steps can be taken to help people have more choices, make better choices, and learn from their own experience? It is not, as the hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms. Armstrong) said, just a matter of recommending types of child care provision. There is not one right answer for different groups of people, and it is not necessarily the same answer throughout the two or three years during which provision may be sought for a particular child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the efforts of European trade unions and employers in trying to reach agreements on the recommendations. Unlike some of my hon. Friends, I have no hesitation in recommending recommendations. It is a way of raising issues further up the political agenda and giving them a higher profile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One area where the European Community has the right approach is in reducing road casualties. One can almost link health and safety at work and children being taken to workplace nurseries. The European Commission has bright, intelligent people who can cook up good ideas—and the EC originally thought that a raft of legislation would be the right approach. The Commissioner concerned, Karel van Miert, decided to accept advice from a British Minister that it would be better to bring experts together, to suggest ways of getting the best practice out into the open so that people know what is available, what has worked in certain circumstances, and what would be the necessary minimum legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum legislation in the sphere of child care should be none. There is no reason for European legislation given the subsidiarity issue, let alone what is in the treaty. It is sad, if the rumour is true, that the word "subsidiarity" does not come into the social chapter of the draft treaties. It should appear there, just as much as it should in the political and economic treaties. If I am wrong about that, I am sure that the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) will correct me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the road casualty analogy is that we have in this country, and can offer to Europe, ways of reducing deaths and serious injuries by 45 per cent in three or four years. The same applies in child care. With that prominence, national measures, employers accepting opportunities and responsibilities, and pressure on right hon. and hon. Members—which, sadly, is not obvious on the Labour Benches—we could see the level of achievement attained in other fields. It ought to be possible to recognise and be proud of the fact that our education provision extends to a younger age group and is more comprehensive in terms of hours than that of other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no point in the hon. Lady shaking her head. Those figures are generally correct. We provide education at a young age and for more hours than other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to correct the hon. Gentleman, but we provide nothing like the educational

opportunities for three and four-year-olds that are available in Denmark and France.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady shows that I have not been making myself clear. Countries that start education at age six miss out on a year's education that we have. Looking at the under-sixes is one way of illustrating that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be worried about some of the measurable detrimental effects of early childhood experiences. Not all effects can be measured, but some can—and we should set targets for reducing them, as we do for road casualties, by setting targets and saying for example, that, over the next eight years, we want to reduce the worst incidents by one third.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to a point on the procedure of the Committee, I hope that if the Leader of the House, or a member of his staff reads the debate, he will see the tribute paid to the Department of Health and the Department of Employment for their preparation of papers for the Committee. I think that every one of the recommendations of those Departments that have been put to the Committee by hon. Members have been adopted or adapted. If that could be circulated by the Leader of the House to other Departments, it would make it easier for members of European Standing Committee A and European Standing Committee B to do their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that any member of the Committee could argue with the fact that my hon. Friend the Minister has done an enormous amount to improve the lot of working women. Nobody in the House and nobody in the Committee has done more than she. I pay tribute to her for that. I understand her enthusiasm for continuing to promote that cause—and I would rather that it were done by her than by the European Commission. As the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) said, this is an important case as regards subsidiarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister said that it was only a recommendation, it is but I can tell her from my experience on the Committee that recommendations soon become directives. We have already seen directives on maternity leave, hours of work, and holidays. I am willing to enter an even money bet with anyone in the Committee for £1, or even one ecu, that if the recommendation is accepted by the 12 member states it will soon become a directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Joyce Quin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not accepting the hon. Gentleman's bet for either £1 or one ecu, but I want to point out that the part of the recommendation that relates to parental need is already a directive. In that case, the directive preceded the recommendation, so the hon. Gentleman's fears have been realised. That contradicts his point that a recommendation necessarily leads to a directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not suggest that it cannot work the other way round.

I was on the European Legislation Selection Committee, which recommended that this matter should be debated here. The subject is all dressed up in mobility and the labour market. It bears the dreaded name of Mrs. Vasso Papandreou and is about extending Community competence into areas of child care. We should have nothing to do with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is a good idea not a good idea when it is not invented in this country?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what my hon. Friend says, but the recommendation contains much that is not a good idea. For example, does my hon. Friend think that it is a good idea for the state to interfere with the sharing of family responsibilities? I believe that it is not. I venture to suppose that not one single Conservative Member of the Committee believes that the state should interfere with that. If the electorate thinks otherwise, it can elect the Labour party, which believes that the state should interfere in affairs of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that members of the Committee use the language employed in the document, which does not suggest any need to interfere. The document states that choice should be given. Some families may choose a pattern of family life that is different from that preferred by the hon. Gentleman. However, he seems not to be prepared to allow families that choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that it should be a matter for the British electorate, not the European Commission. Once we start down that road, we shall find that it ends in European directives determining a common child care policy throughout Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand why Labour favours that. Trotsky once said that three things must be destroyed in the development of a socialist state—religion, patriotism, and the family. A true socialist believes that the state knows best, even about what goes on behind a family's closed doors. We in the Conservative party do not believe that. We think that most such matters are best left to the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the document, only 44 per cent of mothers with children under 11 years choose to work. Labour Members may say that is because there is no state provision of child care facilities. I do not believe that. For instance, my wife and many of her friends—I see that my hon. Friend the Minister is nodding—believe that children under 11 should be brought up by their mothers, at home. The hon. Member for Gatehead, East (Ms. Quin) is grinning at me. Clearly, she does not agree that should be the mother's role
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
—but many women do. Many in the Catholic countries of the European Community would be appalled at the provision by the state, at the taxpayer's expense, of child care facilities for all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such provision does not fall from the sky at no charge. Many women would be horrified by the suggestion that everyone should pay into a common pot to provide state child care for all. They want to take care of their children themselves at home, for nothing. They do not want to pay taxes so that other women may get child care from the state at no cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that Labour will be elected to govern this country, and that the public will decide that they want such a policy. That would be fair enough, and I would abide by that decision. But there is no way that I can approve of the European Commission foisting such a policy on our nation, and I intend to vote against the motion today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.13 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I second earlier comments about the preparation of the papers for the Committee. It really is most helpful. I notice that one of the documents is the 	<i>Hansard</i> record of one the Committee's previous debates, in which I asked specifically that papers be set out in a coherent and comprehensive way. I know that all members of the Committee will be most grateful that has been done on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two ways in which we can approach the document today. We can see it either as representing an unacceptable attempt—and I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) in this regard—to extend the domain of the state, whether it be in the guise of the Community or of national government, into private and family life. Alternatively, we could regard it as one more surreptitious attempt by Madam Papandreou to build up what may be called a jurisprudence of competence for the Commission in social affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is this a pernicious document or is it merely, as I argued earlier, a waste of time? If it were a pernicious document, I should be unable to vote for it—however strong the recommendation from my hon. Friend the Minister, for whom I have the greatest regard. But I am happy to accept the second hypothesis. We waste a lot of time in this institution, but I can think of many worse ways of wasting time than following a recommendation from my hon. Friend. In that spirit, I shall vote for the motion. However, it was extremely useful that both sides demonstrated a great deal of sensitivity and awareness about the competence aspects of the document. I hope those points have been noted by my hon. Friend the Minister and her officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons why we must he particularly alive to the question of competence in social policy. One has been mentioned. It is fairly evident that, to go along with Mrs. Papandreou's ambitions would impose costs on British industry and commerce that would lead to us suffering a competitive disadvantage in many areas. It is clearly unacceptable for any Government to go along with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
The second is not in our national self-interest, but in the Community's self-interest. I am not opposed to Community competence on matters where I believe that it is helpful and in the common interest. It seems destructive of what the Community is trying to achieve to develop a Community competence in the social area; majority voting would certainly be a great disaster. We have had an integrated product market for some years; we now have an integrated factor market; and we are looking forward to the emergence of a single currency—which I shall support if the circumstances are right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a major difficulty arises about how we should cope with integrating into a single market those member states and regions of the Community with widely differing levels of average productivity. When we have a single currency, individual members will no longer be able to devalue national currencies to compensate for relative losses in productivity. Therefore, it is particularly important that we do nothing to interfere with the operation of the price mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If currencies cannot be revalued or devalued to conmpensate for relative changes in productivity, it is important to have a flexible market in which prices and output are responsive and can respond to changes in patterns of demand and of suppliers' costs. Any move to establish certain minimum costs for labour will clearly make it impossible for the labour market to respond flexibly, and an integrated market with a single currency would be disastrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those areas of the Community that have lower average productivity levels would condemn themselves to high and indefinite unemployment. That would cause problems and demands for fiscal transfers to compensate and so forth. That, itself, would merely reinforce the inefficiencies of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have European integration—and I am in favour of that—it is important, in the Community' interests, that we oppose attempts to establish common levels of social costs. We should otherwise deny those member states who have lower average levels of productivity the ability to use their own competitive advantages. That cannot possibly be in anyone's interests. We must take opportunities like this—we see many of them in the House in various contexts—to bring the message home once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have a cat in hell's chance of converting Mrs. Papandreou, but we must try. We must make it clear to our partners that is in the interests of not just Britain but the whole Community. In going down the road of harmonising social measures and imposing common social costs of labour throughout the Community, the Community has embarked on a course that is economically self-destructive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Ms. Armstrong). She pointed out that we support the proposed recommendation. For that reason, I do not oppose the Government's motion today. However, I must make it clear that we do not agree with every
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
word of the motion. We especially do not like its final phrase:
	<br><q><p>"employed parents are not adversely affected by the imposition of statutory arrangements."</p></q>
The Government have not proved that there are such adverse effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not like our unwillingness to vote against the Government's motion to be misinterpreted. The present wording is unsatisfactory, but we should not like to vote against it and thus signal that we oppose the proposed recommendation itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made great play of existing good employers. I pay tribute to the good employment practice in many firms and organisations and even in Government Departments when that can clearly be shown to be so. None the less, the Minister's approach will not make such difference to employers who do not have a good record. My hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West has expressed that anxiety. She wants good practice that is comprehensive in terms both of the number of firms engaged in it and of the regional distribution of those firms. We need a good system throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) seemed to reject a role for the European Community in social matters. Nevertheless, in recent months and years the Government have made great play—I support them in this—of the need for a level playing field, to express it that way, in the European Community. They have said a great deal about it, but I do not believe that they have done much in practice to realise that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other European countries could perhaps rightly say that huge differences in employment rights, pay, child care facilities, and so on, amount to the lack of such a level playing field and favour certain countries at the expense of others. For that reason, I specifically ask the Minister whether she favours a social dimension to the internal market. One cannot simply treat social matters as completely irrelevant to the concept of a level playing field and yet have all the other measures involved in the internal market. I feel strongly about that issue. If the Government do not accept some of the social costs involved in industrial and economic development, they are not serious about that level playing field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the Labour party, just as much as my party, would say that it is in business to defend the national interest. Does the hon. Lady agree that, whenever a proposal comes forward from Brussels or other contexts, we must analyse where our national interest lies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many instances we have, or have imposed on ourselves, high costs of regulatory compliance. That applies to the environment, financial services and many other spheres. Having imposed such costs on ourselves in these respects, it must be in our interests to secure a level playing field and, if possible, to force the rest of the Community to accept the same level of costs. However, in some cases our continental partners and competitors in an economic sense may have imposed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
on themselves higher costs and higher costs of compliance—for example, they may have accepted enormously long compulsory maternity leave, various social benefits and great social insurance costs as in France, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and so on. In that instance, we have a competitive advantage in that we do not impose those costs on ourselves and so it is not in our interests to seek a level playing field. Let us be absolutely clear about where our interests lie and let us aim for them. Surely the Labour party, which likes to present itself as an equally patriotic party, will agree with that fundamental principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that what we consider to be in the national interest should guide us in our approach to such matters. In my view, it is in our national interests to ensure that British citizens enjoy good employment protection rights, good child care benefits, and so on. Therefore, I support many of the European Community's proposals in that sphere because they are in our national interest. Curiously, the hon. Gentleman seemed to say that, if we accept certain environmental costs, they can accept certain social costs, there can be a trade off between those costs. That is completely absurd. A level playing field should mean that we each accept the same environmental and social costs—if they can be called costs. The countries with advanced regulations that have made great strides in child care seem to be successful economically, so I am not certain that the costs argument is as simple as the hon. Gentleman implies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that labour costs are crucial to economic competitiveness? Does she also agree that the crucial element is the real output cost of labour and that that is a function of two variables—the productivity of labour and the unit cost of labour? Therefore, does she agree that, when the productivity of labour is low, one cannot increase with impunity the unit cost of labour without becoming uncompetitive? This country's average productivity is below that of other European countries, such as Denmark, Germany and the Benelux countries. So we cannot afford to accept the same social costs without incurring competitive disadvantages. Is the hon. Lady saying that the Labour party wants us to incur such disadvantages? If so, it would not do any favours for employees in this country as there would be less employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should love to engage in such a debate. But, if I go to wide of the child care document, I shall be ruled out of order. Many costs are incurred by industry, as we know. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that productivity is important. The hon. Gentleman has mentioned environmental costs, but one must consider all the costs incurred by industry and try to ensure that all European competition rules are as harmonised and equal as possible, so that one is not unnecessarily disadvantaged. None the less, if we are less productive in some sectors than in others, we should improve that productivity. Poor conditions for employees should not be used to try to equalise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady and my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
talked about our competitiveness within Europe, but the world does not stop at the European boundary. We also compete with the rest of the world. Does the hon. Lady agree that, if we continue to heap labour and social costs on our industries, we shall put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to the rest of the world? One of the largest private sector employers has moved its factory lock, stock and barrel out of Stockport, in my constituency, to Malaysia as it overheads were too great. In these days of multinationals, the Japanese and the Americans do not have to invest in this country and, if we continue to heap such costs on our already parlous competitive position, we shall simply lose jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made some interesting comments, but, as he often does, he has over simplified the issue. If labour costs only determined where orders were placed, South Korea would take all the world's shipbuilding orders and Japan would not remain the largest ship producer. The issue is not as simple as the hon. Gentleman implies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the national interest includes not only business within the large internal market but giving British citizens a good deal in the European Community. The crux of the argument between the Government and the Opposition is that the Government seem to view the large internal market as a free market in which business can operate without hindrance. We do not see it as an end in itself. We are interested in what it will do for the prosperity levels and working conditions of the citizens of Europe. The Government's approach to the child care document illustrates their approach to the European market as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's approach is weak. We share their intention to support a recommendation, but wish that they would take more resolute and firm action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) said that he might be able to support the motion although, in his considered opinion, the document was a waste of time. I would rather have his support on that basis than not at all, and I accept it gratefully, it is clear that the debate has not been a waste of time, because we have identified some important and difficult issues. The recommendation deals with matters that concern all citizens of the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will forgive me, but the recommendation deals with areas of responsibility that are covered not only by me. I have responsibility for child care. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment has responsibility for equal opportunities for women at work, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department also has responsibility for equal opportunities. However, we are debating the issues in the context of a European Community document, so we have to make clear the role and competence of the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am enthusiastic about the developments taking place in this country. The Children Act 1989 provides a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
major opportunity to carry forward improved child care that is more responsive to local communities. I intend to comment further on that matter in response to the comments of the hon. Member for Durham, north-West (Ms. Armstrong). However, that is different from saying that the European Community should have competence in those areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding was clear and evocative about increased labour costs, lack of competitiveness, and the dangers of business going elsewhere. As I am wearing my child care hat, that is the last thing that I want. Lack of job opportunities in areas where work may be hard to obtain will not help children in families. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that we must be clear about respective responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested that the Minister's argument seems to contradict her earlier comments that provision of child care can be a good, firm business decision because businesses can recruit and retain a more highly skilled work force. Is not that the crux of the matter? Conservative Members have been arguing for a poorly skilled, cheap work force. We want a highly skilled work force that has choice and opportunity. We recognise that investing in the work force is critical to the level playing field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any enlightened and forward-thinking employer recognises that his or her ability to retain skilled workers will have a major impact on the way in which work is carried out. It costs several hundreds of thousands of pounds to train a doctor. If half the doctors trained are women, more fools us if we cannot find ways of retraining them. We do not need to be told that by the European Community because it is self-evident. Those who most want to advance the interests of women—I am not referring specifically to the hon. Members for Durham, North-West and for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin)—do themselves a disservice by exaggerating the equal opportunities aspect and not emphasising the natural desire of employers to provide high quality, cost-effective services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene while my hon. Friend is in full flow, but she is skating on very thin ice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will she consider the other side of the coin—the equal opportunity for women to have the right to stay at home? Does she agree that, if there is to be massive state intervention and a heavy cost for the taxpayer, those women who wish to stay at home will find it more expensive because their husbands, through their taxes, will have to fund child care for women who choose to go out to work? Many young women cannot have children at such a young age as previously because they cannot afford to give up work. Would it not be unfair to exacerbate the problem by massive state intervention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend deprives me of the opportunity of responding in an orderly way. I had hoped to reply to that point later, but will do so straightaway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's contribution was valid. We must not become so overwhelmed with the issues concerning the workplace that we forget the domestic environ-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
ment and the needs of children and women. That is not a matter for the European Community, but I am concerned about matters of competence. In responding to my hon. Friend's comments, I distinguish between my role in having general responsibility for child care and the provisions of the Children Act 1989, and in having some responsibility for woman as co-chairman of the Women's National Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That group strongly endorses the point made by my hon. Friend. The pressure on women to be active in the work force is sometimes great. We all agree that women have a challenge in reconciling their domestic and professional responsibilities. Above all, they usually want not child care but flexible working arrangements and to discuss whether hours should be flexible with term-time working and sometimes a child care option. Too often that discussion is conducted in a simplistic way. During my opening comments, I alerted the Committee to the danger of employers feeling that if they have provided a work place nursery, they have provided equal opportunities. Listening to what women want is the first step. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) for emphasising that matter, which sometimes gets lost in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Durham, North-West suggested that the Government had tried to water down the recommendation. Our intention is simply to ensure that the Community is not granted competence to act in areas in which it has no powers at present and which should remain the responsibility of member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is aware that previous Community measures relating to vocational training and equal opportunities have established that child care matters in that context are within the competence, but that some matters, including the original draft resolution, are outside the competence. Our negotiators have been working to exclude such matters from the text for adoption, including articles 2 and 6 on sharing family responsibilities, articles 3(b) and (d) which apparently extend application to all parents and not only those who are working or receiving vocational training, and article 5(b) on the pay of child care workers. The majority of our objectives have been achieved in the text which is to go to the Council. The Government do not now consider it necessary to block the adoption of the text.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can reassure hon. Members who are worried about competence. The role of the European court was mentioned. The court has said what the legal consequences of a recommendation are. It stresses that a true recommendation is not binding. However, that does not mean that such a recommendation has no legal effect in certain circumstances in which it has an interpretive force. That is why my hon. Friend is right to want to consider the matter carefully and why we have been anxious to ensure that the wording of the recommendation does not imply anything more binding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do we need the recommendation? Why do we not pursue whatever recommendations the Government wish to make on a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
national basis? No sane person would wish to prevent the Minister from exchanging ideas in informal discussions with her counterparts from France or Germany if she so wished. Why do we need the bureaucratic and semi-judicial document before us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are beginning to repeat some arguments. There are already measures on vocational training and equal opportunities that have established child care as a matter within competence. We have satisfied all the points raised by my hon. Friends in detailed negotiations and ensured that we shall not extend competence and that the recommendation is acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for Durham, North. We are not complacent about child care in Britain. However, we have made remarkable progress. We have doubled the number of day nursery places in three years and increased the number of child minder places by 40 per cent. It is objectionable to debate such matters with people who take it for granted that whatever Britain does is wrong and that what anyone does elsewhere must be preferable. That flies in the face of our remarkable record of women at work and the fact that 90 per cent to 95 per cent of three and four-year-olds are involved in some sort of group activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an essential, and evolving, aspect of the Children Act 1989 that the review that takes place between local authorities, parents, employers and voluntary organisations is of great importance. We shall continue, as we do on all child care matters, to work closely with local government. My Department has been involved in the funding of many initiatives to pioneer good practice and pay for research. We give the Pre-School Playgroups Association a grant of about £1 million. We help support the Kids Clubs Network and the National Childminding Association and spend about £2.5 million on several schemes and innovative projects for groups such as homeless families so that we can learn good practice. That is an important record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the enthusiasm of my hon. Friend the Member for Bosworth (Mr. Tredinnick) extended to further child care facilities in this place. I am not sure that a workplace nursery to care for children until 10 pm while we vote is the most appropriate form of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
child care. Many staff here do not need to work until that time, and it is the staff for whom that facility is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My good hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) made an excellent speech in which he reinforced his reputation as someone with longstanding commitment to the issues of child benefit and allowances, of which he has been a great champion. He practises what he preaches, which is more than can be said for some of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Stevens) spoke about information. It is important to gather more effective information so that we can compare matters in a more enlightened way. Article 7 refers to that.
