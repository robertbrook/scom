	<div class='legislation'>Allocation of slots at Community Airports</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On as point of order, Mr. Hill. These Committees are important and it is not the job of Her Majesty's Opposition to provide a quorum. This matter will affect the future of all the major airlines throughout Europe, and it is outrageous that the Government cannot provide a quorum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick McLoughlin (The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that I have to give a brief outline of the documents. If hon. Members have looked through the papers, they hardly need me to tell them that airport slot allocation is a complex subject. Members of the Committee will appreciate that it is not easy to condense into a few minutes the work that the Department and its consultants have carried out over many months. But I shall attempt to give an overview of the issue and to explain how the Government have arrived at the position outlined in the two memoranda that hon. Members have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have always fully supported the principle of liberalising air transport in Europe, and the United Kingdom has worked hard to push through change. With the third liberalisation package under discussion, we are now within reach of a Community single market in aviation, which will benefit users and provide exciting opportunities for United Kingdom airlines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Commission, the Government regard slot allocation as an important element in the structure of the industry. Some two years ago we decided to examine alternatives to the present system, because we were concerned that it might be a barrier for carriers wishing to mount competitive services. The benefits of lifting restrictions on airlines could be at risk if they found themselves unable to get into airports to offer services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, we knew the strengths of the International Air Transport Association system. Worldwide civil aviation scheduling is a complex operation and must, in the end, rest with experienced professionals. Remember that aircraft take off from Heathrow, during operating hours, at an average rate of more than one every two minutes and Heathrow is part of a worldwide network of busy airports. The last thing that the Government want is to become involved in detailed scheduling. The present system has evolved
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
over many years. It is certainly not what one would have designed from scratch, but it works. The procedures enable carriers to put together scheduling networks with the minimum bureaucracy and the maximum flexibility. The airlines have an incentive to sort out their differences in a spirit of compromise and without needing outside agencies. Our consultants, SD-Scicon, found that the existing system worked a lot better than they had expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, we appointed SD-Scicon to examine the scope for change, including moving towards a market-led system of slot allocation. The study was the first of its kind to analyse slot allocation from first principles and attracted a good deal of interest both here and abroad. Though Scicon did not come up with workable options, its study focused minds on how the present system works and the implications of change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scicon examined two options in depth, one a modified version of the existing system, the other a more radical scheme involving the auctioning of slot leases. Both options turned out to be complicated, putting at risk the flexibility of the IATA system. Both would have involved excessive intervention by Governments, which we want to avoid, not only because it would go against the general thrust of our civil aviation policy, but because of the danger of abuse elsewhere in the world, with bad results for United Kingdom airlines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scicon's work also revealed how difficult it would be to introduce money into the allocation of slots, for example through auctions. Auctioning slots would almost certainly lead to allegations of a breach of international agreements on airport charging. We have the current major arbitration with the United States of America over the legality of charges at Heathrow as a warning of that. Furthermore, the consultants could not find acceptable solutions to the problems of grouping slots for auction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State was clear that Scicon had not come up with workable proposals; indeed its work confirmed how difficult it would be to devise arrangements preferable to the existing procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, the IATA procedures have got better. About the time we commissioned our consultants, IATA introduced into its guidelines some priority for new entrant airlines to obtain slots. IATA is now looking at slot wastage. There is evidence that even at the most congested airports a certain number of slots which the holding airline decides not to use are either returned to the pool later than they might be or are not used at all. IATA is considering ways of amending its procedures so that such slots are reallocated in good time to other carriers. The Government welcome that development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change in the London area traffic distribution rules in early 1991 provided an opportunity for the IATA system to prove its adaptability. At a stroke, airlines that had been barred from Heathrow were permitted to apply for slots. Not only did this increase demand for slots at the busiest airport in Europe, it also happened after the scheduling conference for the summer 1991 season had taken place. Yet the system coped. Eighteen airlines previously barred from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
Heathrow are now operating there. They may not all have slots at the times that they wanted, but they have a foothold at the airport, which they can improve as time goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those were the circumstances in which the Secretary of State considered the Government's approach to slot allocation. He was not convinced that a better alternative to the existing arrangements had come forward. There was no evidence that the schemes proposed would lead to user benefits. By reducing the certainty with which airlines could plan their investment and scheduling, and by increasing bureaucracy, they were likely to harm the long-term interests of the industry and of users. United Kingdom airlines based at Heathrow would be affected disproportionately, with little immediate prospect of any advantages, either to users at Heathrow or to the airlines themselves at other airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing system continues to evolve. The Government believe that further improvements are possible and desirable, and will maintain the pressure on the industry to make changes. We will continue to keep the situation under review, but for the present, we believe it is good common sense to look for gradual change to the existing procedures, and the Government are encouraged that the Transport Select Committee came to similar conclusions in its recent report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we continue the hour with questions. I remind hon. Members that they should ask one question at a time. This Committee is not like the Chamber and hon. Members can ask further questions quite easily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your clarification of the procedure, Mr. Hill. I do not know about the Minister, but this is the first occasion on which I have had the honour of addressing one of these Committees. I accept your guidelines, Mr. Hill, and shall keep my initial questions to the Minister as simple as possible. I understand that Opposition Members may make speeches later in the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister reconcile the Government's oft-repeated view of liberalisation with the motion before us this morning, which is rather a damp squib? His statements so far could be summed up as "Much Ado About Nothing". If the present system is working properly, what is all the fuss about liberalisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no change in the Government's desire to see wider liberalisation of the aviation industry. Indeed, the Government's overall policy has brought many benefits, not only to the consumer but to regional airports, which have grown and developed considerably in recent years. There is no inconsistency in the Government's position. The measure under consideration today deals with the system of slot allocation and the best way to proceed so that competition is not inhibited. Slots at major airports are very valuable, and a number of airports in this country use a slot procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hill, for popping in and out of the Room, but I am serving on two Committees
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
this morning. Will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify what is meant in the final line of the motion, which contains the words:
	<br><q><p>"without substanrially extending the role of governments"?</p></q>
I thought that the Government intended to reduce their role, not to extend it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has highlighted what I fear would happen if the European Commission's proposals were to lead to an extension of the Government's role in the scheduling process. We are reluctant to accept any move in that direction. There is no inconsistency in that, as the Government do not want to get too involved in scheduling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many slots at average airports are we talking about, if the Commission decides to become directly involved? How many people are there in the directorate concerned? What hope is there of changing the existing system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She asked a question but I cannot give her the answer. It is legitimate for her to ask and it is legitimate for me to say that I do not know the answer. It would be foolish of me to try to answer. At Heathrow, for example, over 350,000 slots are operated by the scheduling committee. At different times there is a slot problem at different airports, but sometimes there are no problems of availability. At some of our airports the time factor is important. Although a company may have numerous slots, it may not get slots at the times that it wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend say what safeguards are likely to exist in future to preserve the position of regional airlines—those that run feeder services into Heathrow from areas such as the west country and Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And Teesside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend adds Teesside to my list. That is a matter of considerable importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's concern about the matter, which he has raised on several occasions. He loses no opportunity to do so and to make the Government aware of the importance of regional links to major airports. Carriers currently operating services from the regions hold historic slots which are protected by the existing slot allocation system. It is for their commercial judgment whether to continue using slots on existing routes. I assure my hon. Friend that the Government are well aware of his views and those of many other hon. Members about the importance of regional services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To pursue that matter, Liverpool airport is obviously my main concern. The British Midland flight from Liverpool to Heathrow is extremely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
important for the Merseyside area. Are not carriers that run internal and external services, such as British Midland, under pressure to make a judgment not only about the commercial viability of, for example, the flight between Liverpool and Heathrow, but about whether to sacrifice such a slot at Heathrow for more lucrative flight to somewhere in the Common Market? Can the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness, I cannot go much further than the answer that I have just given to the Committee. I recognise the deep feelings of many hon. Members on both sides of the House about the importance of regional services and of a link to a hub international airport. Heathrow is attractive because of the number of international flights that take off from there. A commercial judgment must be made and a balance struck. Sometimes slots are not a problem. When there is a problem, it is usually for slots first thing in the morning and late at night. Slots are a valuable resource. There are slot allocation systems at Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify what representations he has received from the British aviation industry, including the British Airports Authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we commissioned the report, several organisations were consulted. It will be no secret to my hon. Friend that the responses vary. The ending of the traffic distribution laws went a long way to meeting the complaints of British companies that wanted landing rights at Heathrow. We listened widely on the matter. No one has produced a perfect solution to take us forward. People accept that the present system operates fairly well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return to the question of regional links, especially to Heathrow, if there is a change to the existing system, how will the important—as all hon. Members will agree—regional feeder services be guaranteed without
	<br><q><p>"substantially extending the role of government in slot allocation"?</p></q>
If the Government will not guarantee those services, given that the need to operate profitably is the central thrust of the BAA's present policy, who will?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there is genuine anxiety about that on both sides of the House. It is not the domain of any one party. It affects all hon. Members who live in the areas involved and recognise the importance of the services. We are considering what the Commission is proposing for the future of slots. That affects other parts of the Community as well. The hon. Gentleman's question was legitimate and would require further investigation if the position arose. There is a right of appeal to the Civil Aviation Authority on landing charges and other issues, but that is wide of what we are discussing this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What was the volume of evidence produced by the Commission to show that the existing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
scheduling committee was not working properly? What evidence did the Commission produce on the positive advantages of the creation of a co-ordinator? I draw the Minister's attention to article 5. Do the Government accept the definition? Do they think facilities for travellers or airlines will be improved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Lady what evidence was produced. That is the second negative I have given her this morning, for which I apologise. The Commission started to consider the matter to ensure that there was free and open competition. Slots were thought to be a problem. The Commission sought to improve matters and to discover if there was anticompetitive behaviour, which would have been unacceptable to the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to my previous question, I presume that my hon. Friend the Minister meant that he had received no submissions from the aviation industry since the change in the traffic distribution rules in respect of the European Community document. In paragraph 4, the Department of Transport note of 3 February 1992 states:
	<br><q><p>"there are few signs of enthusiasm for the Commission's proposals."</p></q>
What does that wonderful euphemism mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that means that there is little enthusiasm for the Commission's proposals. Nothing could be more forthright. As my hon. Friend, who is knowledgeable about these issues, recognises, one may start by saying, "This is a good idea, we should do this particular thing", but one must consider the implications of such a change. The change will affect not only the Community; it will have international repercussions and domestic implications for regional services. We do not want necessity to restrict the possible growth of aviation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government did away with the traffic distribution rules for London. More services are available and more carriers can get into those airports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to know how much money was spent on the consultants' report, as their recommendation was not accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the consultants' report cost about £250,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is about timing. I sense, from reading the Department's observations on the matter, that there is no great urgency to put the initiative into effect. Does my hon. Friend know when these matters may come to a head? Consultants have been appointed to advise Her Majesty's Government and it would be silly if the matter came to a head in Europe before the consultants reported. Am I correct in believing that the issue has been put on the back burner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, perhaps very accurately, describes the position. However, I do not want to give him the impression that we are still awaiting the consultants' report. We have had that report
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
and its recommendations were not acceptable because they did not take us further forward. There is no great enthusiasm for the proposal. We are awaiting the view of the European Parliament transport committee, when the Commission may want to revise its thoughts on the issue. That will not be in the immediate future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us what the attitude is of Her Majesty's Government to the "use it or lose it" definition of slots? Article 9 on slot pools suggests that there will be timetables and changes in existing slot allocation. The Minister will know that the report of the Select Committee on Transport, which I am sure he has studied carefully, recommended that the "use it or lose it" allocation should be the norm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We took great notice of the Select Committee on Transport. Paragraph 74 of its report stated:
	<br><q><p>"We recognise the profound difficulties of altering completely the present system and accept that change will have to be evolutionary. Nevertheless, we welcome the studies reviewing the options for change, although we acknowledge that the IATA scheduling guidelines are widely accepted by the airlines and represent a workable, if imperfect, method of allocating slots at Heathrow and Gatwick. We therefore accept that it will be necessary to retain the IATA scheduling guidelines at those airports until a workable alternative system is found."</p></q>
On the slot pool, there is concern to ensure that the slots are used and that those that are not are returned in adequate time to be reallocated so that another airline can use them effectively. That is sensible. We endorse it, and there should be no difficulty in getting it accepted. We approve in principle of "use it or lose it", but the clause needs strengthening, and clarification should be considered in the light of IATA's words. We want use to be made of all available slots, because that makes sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister thinks that the expression "there are a few signs of enthusiasm" is clear, he has been out of the coal mines for too long because I do not think that that was was said when he worked there. Can he clarify the position in relation to Frankfurt? Is there any indication of willingness on the part of the German authorities to open slots there, or will they tie them up even more, now that the Germans and the French are working together with Air France? Will British and other airlines have reasonable access to Frankfurt airport?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that my hon. Friend found the words that I used a little less explicit than those I might have used about 10 years ago, but I take his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankfurt airport is very congested, and I understand that the German authorities have no intention of changing its present status. That is one reason why the question has evolved into an important issue in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend knows, not so long ago we had restrictions at Heathrow airport. We removed those restrictions and we will be able to tell various people, in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
the light of what happened at Heathrow, about the way in which the slot allocations were able to meet demand. I accept that that to a limited degree, but there is always more demand for slots at Heathrow than those that are currently available. I hope that our experience at that airport will make people look closely at the changes that we have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the regulation protect business aviation? What is the Government's attitude to the protection of limited numbers of slots for business users?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am determined not to say that I do not know the answer to the hon. Lady's question. The regulation would not alter current arrangements for business aviation slots. However, the Government believe that passenger movements should be given priority at major United Kingdom airports. Obviously, business aviation is important for the communications and attractions of a country, but every business aviation, movement means one movement fewer for the carriage of passengers or the provision of other services that hon. Members might find desirable. A balancing act must be performed between proposals for business aviation and those for regional services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A lack of enthusiasm is one thing, a lack of urgency is another. Is full attention being given to the effects of the recession on the problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two ways in which decisions about that undoubted problem might be disguised or distorted by the recession. For example, if there are many half-empty flights, it is possible for carriers more easily to rationalise use of the slots that they have. In the context of my question about slots from regional airports into Heathrow in competition with slots for external flights, the recession might cause a carrier to take a commercial decision to abandon a slot because a flight from a regional airport was no longer viable because of the downturn in trade and traffic between that regional airport and Heathrow. When the upturn occurs, that slot will no longer exist and I want to ensure that solutions to a problem in the middle of recession will also work when we emerge from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, we must consider the tremendous growth in aviation movements over the past 10 years. Due largely to better communications and technology, there has also been a substantial growth in air traffic movements at Heathrow airport over that period. In 1979 there were about 250,000 ATMs while in 1991 the figure was 350,000. That increase is due mainly to new equipment and greater flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an availability to hold slots at airports for a particular period, but no one is suggesting that companies should risk losing other business which they could pick up. I am sure that the Committee will wish to congratulate British Airways on the tremendous profits that were announced yesterday. It is a great credit to the airline industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return for a moment to the consultants' report, I understand that initially the consultants

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public money was spent on that report and all the options have now been discarded. Had that much money been spent by a local authority, the Secretary of State for the Environment would have bristled with synthetic indignation and sent round the district auditor on the first available bus. Does not the Minister think that he owes the Committee an explanation about what recommendations were made, particularly in stage one of the report, and why they are not before us this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a few points to make. First, stage one of the report proposed four options. Partly for the reasons that I gave earlier, it was necessary to narrow those down to see which way to proceed. I do not think that any options were ruled out on ideological grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman is critical of us for looking into what could develop into a serious problem for a major industry. We naturally want to ensure that our airline industry is in a good position to take up the opportunities available to it. Therefore, we are looking at the best way of operating slots in the UK. There might have been complaints had we not considered the matter very closely. Obviously, there is a great deal of interest in the report, which is available to anyone who wishes to read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The paper from the Select Committee on European Legislation which refers the matter to this Committee, and in which the Scicon reports are examined in some detail, states at the top of page 3 that the study
	<br><q><p>"usefully revealed that auctioning slots or slot leases would raise a number of serious unresolved legal and practical difficulties."</p></q>
I served on the Committee stage of the Broadcasting Act 1990 in which we debated auctioning slots. That was for a slightly different purpose but it was, in economic terms, comparable. Do the Government believe that we should not auction slots for air travel in this way? If so, as a slot has a considerable economic value, how would the Commission's proposals or the Government's preference affect events such as the sale of Pan Am's slots when it had to pull out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend requires answers to a number of points. There were unresolved practical and legal questions for the grouping of slot options. As I said earlier, it is not always a question of shortage of slots, but the time of those slots' availability. That would have caused problems. It would have needed complex regulatory machinery to prevent larger airlines acting anti-competitively. That was a major consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend drew a comparison between broadcasting companies and airlines. That is not fair comparison because there are 350,000 slots at one international airport alone. There would have been difficulties. If the anti-competitive element had been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
proven, it might have caused retaliatory action from other countries because the industry is international.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot remember all the other points that my hon. Friend raised—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Currie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: About selling slots. They have a value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLaughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a grey area. One of the reasons why we got rid of the traffic distribution rules at Heathrow was to remove some of the grey areas, as in the point made by my hon. Friend about Pan Am. There are no property rights to slots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has addressed one aspect of the sale of slots. It is unclear from the Commission's documents what its attitude is towards grandfather rights and to sixth, seventh and eighth rights. In the negotiations with the United States, one large airline insisted that seventh rights should be negotiated. What is the Government's position? Are the Government prepared to hold out for equal treatment of cabotage before any agreement is reached that would have a direct effect on Britain and its trade?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLaughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Lady referred to cabotage. That is a subject of complex international negotiations. We attempt to spread services and to give greater opportunities to some of our national carriers than to others. That area is not addressed in the document as far as slot allocation is concerned. Confirmation of historical rights is contained in 2a on page 20 of the document, but the wording is a bit clumsy. The Government would not have started from scratch with the present system, but it has grown up over a number of years and no better way had yet been put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 4496/91 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Department of Transport on 3 February 1992 relating to the allocation of slots at Community airports; notes that the principle of efficient, neutral and transparent airport coordination is in line with the Government's aims; notes the strengths of the existing worldwide system of slot allocation; and endorses the Governments' intention to respond to the draft Regulation on the premise that any change to the system should benefit users without creating practical difficulties for the civil aviation industry, and without substantially extending the role of governments in slot allocation.</p></q>
The Commission has produced a draft regulation on slot allocation at Community airports. The contents of the proposal are summarised in the Department's explanatory memorandum, produced this time last year. We are waiting for an amended draft from the Commission, in the light of the European Parliament's opinion, given in December. The Department's recent supplementary explanatory memorandum summarises the UK industry's reactions to the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should say at once that the Government are not convinced that the Community needs to take action on slots. As I explained earlier, we are looking for gradual
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
change to the existing system, and this can occur regardless of Community action. We know that other member states are not keen on making substantial changes by a Community regulation. But we have to face the possibility that momentum for change may build up, perhaps because of the threat of action from the competition directorate, when its current block exemption expires at the end of this year. The competition directorate has the power to include slot allocation rules in its next block exemption without reference to the Council of Ministers. If Community provisions on slot allocation procedures are to be made, the Government would prefer to see them in a regulation adopted by the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of uncertainties about the progress of the proposals, which makes it difficult to be firm at this stage about the Government's tactics. The work that we and our consultants have done over the past two years has put us in a strong position to influence the debate, but we need to keep our negotiating options open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot be sure how energetically the current Presidency will pursue the matter. The Portuguese are reported to want to conclude it by the end of June, but given the lack of detailed debate so far and the worries of member states about the contents of the regulation it is difficult to believe that they can meet that timetable. Beyond June, the UK's Presidency will condition our approach to the debate. Progress on the liberalisation package will also affect our negotiating position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are something of a mixed bag. A number of provisions within the regulation aim to improve the quality and openness of the scheduling process, which the Government strongly endorse. Coordination of congested airports in the UK is carried out in an independent and efficient manner, and these proposals would bring practice in other countries more into line with United Kingdom standards. That could benefit the industry and users generally, and the UK airlines in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that the present proposals imply more Government involvement than we have in the UK, and more than is consistent with the general move in Europe towards less state intervention in aviation. We need to consider whether the regulation offers the best way of achieving some of the objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most controversial elements in the draft regulation are those on forced surrender of historic slots, in certain circumstances, on a route-specific basis. That would represent a substantial departure from past practice, and—not surprisingly—is strongly opposed by the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt the Minister before he moves on? He said that the proposals might involve the Government in more intervention in aviation. Surely the Government have a direct involvement in the negotiation between member states. One of the hazards of this mess of pottage is that the Government themselves are a controlling factor in how many airlines get landing rights in certain countries. That has a direct effect on slots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that as the debate will be open to everyone and I shall call as many hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill. I shall be guided by your comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady is wrong. We are discussing slots. The Government are not involved in the allocation of slots at particular airports, but they are involved in the wider issue of air route rights. There is no inconsistency in what I have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to what I was saying on historic rights. The Government are not committed to preserving historic rights in all circumstances, but we believe that it would be justifiable to reclaim slots from airlines only if a clear advantage to users would result. The Government are not persuaded that the Commission's proposals would benefit users. There is no guarantee, or even reasonable expectation, that an airline receiving a slot from a competitor on the same route would use it more efficiently, and that the threat of forced surrender of slots might discourage incumbents from investing additional resources in profitable services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our underlying objective in negotiating with the Commission and our Community partners will be to secure benefits for users by promoting airline competition without placing unreasonable restrictions or burdens on the industry. Operating within that policy framework, and with the benefit of a detailed analysis of slot allocation, I believe that the Government are well placed to steer the debate on slots in Europe in a direction that is both favourable to users and acceptable to the industry. We shall determine our detailed negotiating tactics in the light of the course of the debate and of other relevant circumstances. That clearly indicates the direction in which we are going. Had we not done so much work on slot allocations, we should not be in such a strong position to argue our case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government's policy seems to be that they are not in favour of interfering in these matters unless the EEC wishes to change the existing system, in which case, they may or may not be in favour of interfering with the way in which slots are allocated. The Government have adopted a confusing position, although, given the conflict between ideology and reality in this, as in so many other matters, perhaps we should not be surprised at the Minister's apparent confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is only a year or so since the European Commission first submitted the proposals for the Council regulation that would abolish the current system of slots allocation based on grandfather rights. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
has not been sprung on the Minister in the past few days. The proposals to define circumstances in which slots can be taken from an incumbent operator and given to a new airline have been set out starkly and debated in various quarters since they were first published. Even further back in September 1990, the Government commissioned an independent consultants' report into alternative ways to allocate slots at designated airports. After the publication of the EC draft, it is apparent that the Government have rejected the consultants' proposals, either for ideological reasons or because they were too complex to be practical and workable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to suggest that he had rejected the EC draft. He said that the Government were conscious that the IATA system continued to work effectively and that any sight of the new London area traffic distribution rules was sufficient to iron out allocation controversies. In a somewhat contradictory way. he argued that that was compatible with air transport liberalisation in Europe, to which the Government are supposedly dedicated. He claimed that other EC countries were not enthusiastic about the new regulation and he implied that the industry was not keen on it either. That would not be surprising. The industry probably thinks that it has too much to lose by such a change. I should be interested to know more. I think that the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Hayward) pressed the Minister on that point, but he did not receive a very full answer on what consultation had taken place with the industry and what its views were. The Minister need not go in to much detail, but we would be interested to know exactly what views have been expressed by the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is apparent that the present system of slot allocation based on grandfather rights is not compatible with the Government's policy of liberalisation of air transport within the Community. It was not long ago that a Conservative Government decided to introduce a Civil Aviation Bill, which proposed to auction slots at Britain's busier airports. That proposal was greeted in a less than rapturous way, particularly by some smaller airlines at regional airports and the whole idea was quietly dropped after the Bill was declined a sittings motion on two successive weeks in Committee. In those days, there was no talk of legal complications from the then Secretary of State. Every time that the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) saw a legal complication, he got out his steam-roller and drove over the top of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have introduced legislation to bring about a slot auction system which the Minister now says is beset by legal difficulties. We understand some of those difficulties, not least because of the impending general election. The Under-Secretary and other Ministers in the Department of Transport can hardly have relished the thought of Lord King rampaging up and down Marsham Street and Downing Street en route to the television studios to denounce what he would see as a detrimental step for his airline. I always refer to it as "his" rather than "our" airline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hayward 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman. I do not own any but it is the United Kingdom flag carrier, despite being in private hands. Any member of the Committee can properly refer to it as our airline for those reasons. Let us not quibble whether it is "ours" or "his". Certainly Lord King is in no doubt who it belongs to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not tempt me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill. I was not implying for a moment that it was your airline. There might be some difficulty in another place if we referred to it too often as being our airline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I press the Minister on what consultation has taken place with BA and the other UK-owned airlines about these proposals. I was somewhat amused to learn that the consultants have concluded that
	<br><q><p>"an unfettered market in slots would be abused by large financially-secure incumbent airlines".</p></q>
I hesitate to draw that to the attention of the current chairman of BA. One can imagine, at the very least, a wry smile crossing his face if he saw that. What a pity that those consultants were not hired a year or two ago when the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury was in charge of these matters. They would have been unceremoniously bundled from his office for daring to introduce such a note of common sense into the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendation most favoured by the Department, although not accepted, is called a market hybrid option, which involves the auction of seven-year slot leases, and something called secondary monetarised trading. I must reveal my ignorance and admit that I have not a clue what that means. The Under-Secretary is much more experienced in the affairs of the stock exchange and the money markets than I am, and perhaps he could define it before we adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals also envisage historic slots being converted to slot leases and being auctioned over a five-year period. The weakness of such a scheme is that, as with the previous Bill to which I referred earlier, it favours larger, rich airlines at the expense of some of the smaller ones which all members of the Committee are agreed fulfil a vital role of serving Britain's regional airports and linking into international flights at Heathrow and Gatwick. I understand that the Government now feel that slot auctioning—I wrote down the phrase because it tickled me so much—poses serious practical and legal difficulties. And so say all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of the Commission's proposals is that they are at least as complex and probably as controversial as the consultants' recommendations and the "do nothing" option which, for understandable reasons, the Government have plumped for. Does the Minister think they go any way to creating an overall Community policy rather than the present situation where member states do their own thing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingswood spoke about the situation at Frankfurt. Has the Minister sounded out the Germans for their view on the implementation of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
the EC recommendations, especially with regard to their impact on Frankfurt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some aspects of the recommendations seem to be more acceptable than others. I want to press the Minister about the special circumstances outlined in the EC proposals whereby one carrier cannot reciprocate a new inter EEC service on an increasing frequency. What is the Government's view about special circumstances? Does the Minister think that the Commission's proposals are justified?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) referred to the support of the Select Committee on Transport for the use it or lose it scheme. What impact would such a scheme have on British airlines? I, like my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich, understand the justification for such a policy, given that many slots—especially at Heathrow—are in the hands of airlines which seem, perhaps understandably in a recession, to be somewhat cavalier about taking them up. What are the Minister's views on that issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's view on the Commission's proposals to expropriate slots from carriers operating aircraft with fewer than 200 seats and using more than six slots per day on any one route? Offhand, I cannot think of any British carriers that would be affected by that proposal, but I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us what impact it would have on British airports and carriers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite their brave talk about liberalisation, the Government are aware of how dangerous the acceptance of either their consultant's report of the EC's proposals could be at present. I do not accept the Minister's argument that the merits of the present system were proved by the fact that last summer passed quite peacefully, especially at Heathrow. Last summer was the first time for many years that a reduced number of passengers were carried from Heathrow. According to the Prime Minister, the recession is already over. But how do the Government propose to cope with the inevitable upsurge in air traffic that will take place when, eventually, the recession really is over?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to achieve agreement across the Community, but such agreement seems as far away as ever. The Minister is charged, as were his predecessors, with defending Britain's aviation interests in a contradictory and conflicting policy arena. I hope that he will do so. It is easy to talk about liberalisation, and it is also easy to damage Britain's long-term aviation interests by an unguided move down that road. The rest of the Community seems to consider the Government's liberalisation proposals with a degree of well-merited scepticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

or two vital points. It would be useful to place in the Commission's offices a large sign stating, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." If that sign were translated into all 12 Community languages, we might at least get somewhere with the relevant directorate. That is a clear example of what happens in the Commission when it is seized by a "folie de grandeur".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the position of an existing international organisation that has evolved over several years. It might be inadequate in some ways, nevertheless it practically allocates slots to major airlines and it is capable of being reasonably flexible in relation to important political points, such as allowing space for regional airlines and not excluding all business travellers. Given such an organisation, it is bizarre that the Commission, without having any real evidence, suddenly decides to throw the whole of that operation into a melting pot and come up with its own system. The result of such action is contained in the proposal. The document is tremendously inadequate. It interferes in specific and narrow points of slot allocation, but it does not expand on the other highly complex but relevant bits of machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the Government have no airports or airlines policy. They never have had since they came to office, and the substitute for such a policy is the straightforward suggestion along the lines of, "If we have an asset, we will sell it. If we do not have an asset that we can sell, we shall have to look for an alternative way of raising money." The Government are prepared to sell our major airline because it can be turned into cash, but when it comes to negotiations on behalf of that airline, they say that it is a national flag carrier and that they must protect its interests and ensure that it is given considerable support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's comments are fairly inconsistent with those made by Lord King over the past six months or so about the Government's aviation policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be a considerable surprise to the Minister to know that I am not astonished by the idea that I am not making the same remarks as Lord King. Even though he is a friend of my mother, I should be worried if I found myself saying the same things as him. However, all of us have nightmares of one sort or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for us to say to the directorate that it does not have sufficient evidence of misuse of the existing slots allocation to produce an alternative scheme without carrying out a great deal of detailed and careful work. That work has not been done because, first, the directorate is far too small. Secondly, the directorate has solved many problems because it first decided on the conclusions and it is now working back towards those conclusions. Thirdly, it has made it clear to the Select Committee on Transport and to individual Members of Parliament that in future the battle for the allocation of slots will not be between individual airlines within the Community but will be a transatlantic battle between European and American
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
carriers which will expect to carry out all the negotiations for the European airlines. Such a position would be laughable if it were not so frighteningly unrealistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission does not have the ability nor the staff to undertake such negotiations, and it should not have the power to do so. Such a provision is not within the treaties. It is not the Commission's responsibility and it has not shown any evidence of being capable of doing it. Over and above that, we must consider the experience of slot allocation in the United States—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister has left his seat. Is he thinking of leaving us? My speech may not be the most ingratiating or exciting speech in the world, but it would be nice if the hon. Gentleman remained in the Committee. He has sat down again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider what is happening about slot allocation in America. My hon. Friend pointed out the absurdity of the Government's initial decision to auction the slots. The Government then realised that they would have to value the slots and consider the way in which the auction would take place. Inevitably, those airlines with the economic muscle would squeeze out the smaller and newer airlines. Regional airlines would be the first to go, and Heathrow would have no flights from Glasgow, Manchester, the south-west or any other region. That idea appeared to have been abandoned, but the so-called liberalisation in America—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This has nothing to do with America. The hon. Lady must concentrate on the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In countries where slot allocation in theory has been liberalised, airlines control the piers at airports. An aeroplane's ability to fly is less important that its ability to land. In Europe, the ability to land depends on the allocation of the slot. The lesson from other countries is clear: if airlines are not allowed free access to good facilities at the airports at which they are offered slots, the benefits of greater slot allocation can be blocked. That happens all the time in America. Liberalisation works against the consumer's interests and it is clear that, in America, it will cause far more difficulty than was originally envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on Transport considered the business of slot allocation. The Committee did not believe that it could be isolated from all the other factors affecting decisions about airports, nor that the CAA could solve its slot allocation problem by throwing out regional or other airlines that will not use a slot for a transatlantic flight. Moreover, it considered that the Government have a responsibility to ensure that British interests are considered in relation to those of other large and powerful national airlines. One of the difficulties in this country is that Lord King talks like the head of a national airline when it suits him, but at other times he talks like the head of a privatised airline. Other countries do not have that problem. The French understand that their national airline has gobbled up all internal competitors and intends to develop Charles de Gaulle airport at the expense of anyone who sticks his nose over the parapet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should recognise that the people who produced the order that we are considering have said
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
repeatedly that they expect the only truly important airport in the European Community in 10 years will be either Charles de Gaulle or Schiphol. If that happens—whether it be because of difficulties of slot allocation at Heathrow as a result of the Government's attitude or because the Government have fallen between the two stools of a hands-off approach and negotiation—the British consumer will suffer. The consumer in the regions who wants to get to London whenever convenient will suffer, as will the people who, having been told that the goal was cheap fares, discover that all the cheap fares have disappeared within a year or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have refused to produce a clear, farsighted aviation policy. They have made the worst possible job of protecting British interests. However, the solution proposed by the European Commission is, if anything, even worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hayward 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In light of my intervention during the speech by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape), I should declare my interest and, at the same time, congratulate British Airways on its results, which were published yesterday. Following the dramatic rise of lop a share, my net worth rose by £8.80, as I own 88 British Airways shares. I ask the 	<i>Hansard</i> writer to put the dots in the right place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may ask the 	<i>Hansard</i> writer to take no notice of those remarks. The hon. Gentleman should proceed with the subject under debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand from the opening remarks of the Minister and from the speech by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East that this is their first time on this Committee. They will discover that it is often the Committee's role to stiffen the spines of Ministers and civil servants in their negotiations with Europe, which is appropriate. This debate is no exception, as the motion is extremely disappointing. It should not contain the phrase
	<br><q><p>"without substantially extending the role of governments".</p></q>
The objective should be to reduce the role of Government, rather than to have such a guarded observation on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that it is extremely difficult to devise any policy that people will regard as right. Almost anything that the Government choose to do will be slammed from one direction or another, especially as Heathrow is one of the most, if not the most, overcrowded airports in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is disappointing that, as we move through 1992, there is no clear sense of direction in the motion or firmness in what the Minister said to try to resolve the problem of slot allocation at Europe's airports or, alternatively, to break down some of the barriers at those airports. I gained the impression that the matter will probably drift right through the Portuguese presidency. I was especially disappointed by the Minister's comments about the United Kingdom presidency, as they set no clear objective for resolving the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I contest the hon. Gentleman's intervention about the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Importantly, there must be clear indentification of what the Government will do in its presidency late this year. Undoubtedly, if we have no clear objective when we gain the presidency, absolutely nothing will be achieved by the end of our presidency. In their airlines and airports policies, the Government should continue to be tough with the Europeans to ensure that they open up their closed markets, which we all know exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission is not an effective regulator of the monopolies in Europe's other major aviation markets, particularly those in Germany and France. With the help of the Dutch and Irish Governments, who have supported us, we should pursue a firm policy to break the hegemony that is still developing in Germany and France.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of their tough open policy, I welcome what the Government did to traffic distribution rules at Heathrow. That is a clear indication of what a sensible policy can achieve. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East referred to a Bill that failed to get beyond the sittings motion. I hesitate to intrude too much on our private grief. That Bill proposed a limit on air traffic movements at Heathrow, which was one of the reasons why Conservative Back-Benchers were so opposed to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that there are now 350,000 air traffic movements at Heathrow, whereas just over a decade ago there were only 250,000 such movements. It is a salutary warning to Governments who intervene in airports policy that, at the time of the Bill, the maximum figure was 275,000 movements. The Government should not intervene too much in the general policy, but they should make clear to CAA and BAA that efficiencies at an airport such as Heathrow should be maximised. Miami airport, which has roughly the same layout of runways, achieves substantially more movements that Heathrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What exactly does that mean? Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that regional airlines should be asked to allocate their slots? If Heathrow controlled slots in the way that they are controlled at Miami airport, it would be very unpopular with some of its users.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that within the daily operation at Heathrow it is possible at the moment—and for several years to come—to retain regional airlines and business aviation. There is room in the day-to-day operation of Heathrow for substantial gains in efficiency. I welcome Sir Michael Bishop's proposals for the operation of Heathrow. They should be considered extremely carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that pressure should be put on regional airlines or business aviation to move out of Heathrow while there is still room for improved efficiency. Even after that, any change of policy would have to be carefully argued. At the moment there is room for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
efficiency gains and there is no reason to put substantial pressure on either to move out of Heathrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should adopt a tough but open policy. They should put further pressure on the Europeans to take a positive approach to opening their skies and their airports to airlines in general. If we achieve that, the customer and the airlines, especially British airlines—not just British Airways—which are the most effective operators in Europe, will benefit enormously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward O'Hara 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to deal with a matter that has not been referred to much. Paragraph 6 of the supplementary explanatory memorandum says that in consultations with the industry in the United Kingdom some respondents have suggested that attention should be confined to congested airports. I shall deal with that issue because it is important that we broaden our sights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to solutions at a time of recession and said that they must work when we emerge from recession. I spoke about the vulnerability of regional airports. I shall not burden the Committee by reiterating those points in full, but I should like to make two further related points. I shall try to be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 on page 3 of the original explanatory memorandum refers to solutions that involve more efficient use of infrastructure. Various solutions are suggested, including some that I find rather alarming, such as reducing the distance between flights not only in time but in lateral separation. That may be worth considering, but it is undesirable to look in that direction without widening our sights to include alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Holistic solutions should be considered. I refer again to alternative airports that may be available. Coming from Merseyside, I offer the example of the complimentary relationship between Liverpool and Manchester airports. They cover an enormous catchment area and, obviously, people go to Manchester because it offers more flights and more slots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister to say that Manchester airport uses a slot system. One might look more widely at other options in the area, for example, Liverpool airport has enormous potential for expansion. I believe that I am correct in saying that it is almost unique in Europe in the land that is available to it. It has more than Heathrow or Frankfurt. It is even comparable to Charles do Gaulle and it offers environmentally friendly approaches over water. I shall not develop my eulogy for the potential of Liverpool airport, but I cite it as an example to show that if one looks more holistically at the problem of congested airports, desirable solutions may be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that British Aerospace is the major shareholder in Liverpool airport but the Department of Transport could be involved in providing the necessary transport infrastructure. If that means more Government involvement, so be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Mr. Hill, called the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) immediately after her hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) because two voices on Europe were heard in their respective speeches. I took note that the hon. Gentleman referred to the need for agreement across the Community, but that the hon. Lady wants none of that. I believe that she speaks for the traditional view of the Labour party on matters European rather than expressing its new-found Euro-enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I side with the hon. Lady on that issue. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall ignore remarks about Lord King. I am referring to the position of the European Community. Like the hon. Lady, I find the document totally unsatisfactory as are so many documents that come from the Commission. It is extraordinarly vague. I do not know what the Commission is getting at. It seems to be saying that it wants a leading role in deciding how slots are allocated. The attitude of Her Majesty's Government, as set out by my hon. Friend the Minister, is absolutely correct, despite its rather sneering dismissal by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman wants us to hand over the matter to Europe, lock, stock and barrel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have been accused in virtually the same breath of Euro-fanaticism and of sneering at the Minister, perhaps I should explain my remarks a little better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend was also accused of being more progressive than me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such an accusation has never before been levelled at me. I advise the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) that I was not offering a paean of praise to the European Commission, but saying that all Europeans should come to an agreement across Europe rather than allow the Commission to make it on their behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clearing up that misapprehension and I note what he said. Nevertheless, the Government's approach is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should regard the document with a fair degree of scepticism, but I know from my years in the European Parliament that if one takes a dismissive view of such documents, they have a habit of coming back and hitting one hard behind the ear when one least expects it. The Government's position is correct and, no doubt, they will argue it with customary vigour when and if the matter comes to the Transport Ministers Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the question period of the Committee I touched on the vexed issue of continuing access for regional airlines, especially to Heathrow. I should declare an interest—not one of personal finance but of my region and constituency. It is personal in the sense that I normally travel to the House on the 11.7 am Brymon service from St. Mawgan airport, Newquay. I return on the Thursday night sleeper. I share my travel equally between British Rail and Brymon. Both are essential to the well being of Devon and Cornwall,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
especially Cornwall. Brymon is a major factor in the battle to improve the economy of Devon and Cornwall. I shudder to think what would happen to our fight for inward investment if we did not have a regional airline flying to Heathrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise the importance of Heathrow. It would be no good having a regional airline that flew to a peripheral airport. That would destroy the basis of a regional airline. In the great scale of things, and in the outlook of bodies such as the British Airports Authority, the little carriers are a darn nuisance. They think of Brymon's plane taking up a valuable slot. However, it is necessary and essential that small carriers should have continued access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position has eased over the past year. If we had been debating the matter a year ago, I would have been worried about the future of small carriers. I have a continuing fear, which I hope will never materialise, of pressure on small carriers coming from two directions. First, I fear that their costs will be raised, as was threatened a year or so ago, through increased landing charges at Heathrow. That problem has eased in the past six months, but it is a continuing danger. Allied to that is that if there were a free market in slots, carriers under financial pressure might sell off their access slots to Heathrow. That is a potentially dangerous combination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I largely agree with Opposition Members. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, it is a cross-party issue. The case for continued access has been argued irrespective of party. There is a continuing role, in whatever system emerges, for the Government. They should at least have reserve powers to guarantee reasonable access to Heathrow for regional airlines and airlines that operate regional services. That is essential and I have argued for it consistently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As personality has entered the debate, I may say that I am reassured that the present Transport Secretary represents a Scottish seat and understands the importance of maintaining access for the regions to the country's premier airfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regions and nations would be the appropriate phrase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. I did not have such confidence when another of my right hon. Friends was Transport Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister gave us a vague reassurance. I realise that he cannot give cast iron assurances on such matters and I was heartened by the Government's acceptance of the importance of regional airlines and regional air services. It is of paramount importance to regions and nations that those links are maintained under whatever system emerges. I shall go on fighting the issue so long as I am a Member of Parliament, which—I say it before the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East comes back at me—I hope will be for some years yet. It is crucial to areas such as Devon and Cornwall that the link into Heathrow is maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly sum up the points
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
that have been made, as some hon. Members have had to go to other Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) brings to the Committee a wide view of what goes on in the Community. He is a former Member of the European Parliament, which is very helpful on these occasions. I understand his anxiety, which he has raised before and will continue to raise. We shall take close and careful note of what he says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agreed with much of what the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) said and I go along with her view that "If it isn't broken, don't fix it", especially when the issue is as complicated as this one. I was, however, surprised by some of her points as she is a member of the Select Committee on Transport and was present when my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Transport appeared before it. He made it clear that consumers come first, not the airlines. He went to great lengths to stress the importance of consumers and of giving them choice. It would be detrimental to consumers in this country to have one national airline that was almost the voice of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We mentioned Scotland. There has been a tremendous improvement in the service since two services have been available in Scotland. Competition helps the consumer considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was different. Gestures towards small airlines do not protect the consumer in the face of the increasing size of national airlines and the amount of competition between them. I acknowledge that the Minister's right hon. and learned Friend said that he was concerned about consumers, but we must remember that Conservative Secretaries of State for Transport do not last long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wait and see. My right hon. and learned Friend regularly and often uses transport communications—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is he, the seventh?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not surprising that we have had a number of Secretaries of State for Transport. We have been in Government for 13 years, unlike the Opposition, which has not had that privilege, and I hope never will have it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We attach great importance to the role of regional airports. One great and welcome change in the past 10 years is the way in which regional airports have grown. Although we may argue about the reason why, I believe that it is because of liberalisation. More services are available from local airports to people who live in the locality. The hon. Lady serves on the Select Committee on Transport and therefore knows about the issues discussed. I agree with the thrust of her arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) asked whether it was not about time that the European airports got together, rather than were told what to do by the Commission. That is exactly what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
IATA does. It pulls the airports together to sort out slot allocations and in the Government's view, it works relatively well, although perhaps not as perfectly as we would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me to explain the market hybridity system proposed in the Scicon report. It is basically a two-tier system: in the first year slots would be auctioned off and then there would be secondary trading for money among some of the airlines. I do not necessarily agree with that proposal and neither, I think, will the hon. Gentleman if he thinks it through. I know that he was not seriously suggesting adopting the system, but simply asking me to explain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Hayward) made a number of points. He spoke of stiffening the backbone and said that he did not like the last line of the motion which says:
	<br><q><p>"without substantially extending the role of governments in slot allocation".</p></q>
It is certainly not the Government's intention to extend their role in that area, but we must be aware of the reality and of what happens in other countries. That is what the motion is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for detaining the Committee, but I should like the Minister to speak further on the point raised by his hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris). Surely it is incompatible with the free market to have the sort of service run by Brymon, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, if there is to be complete liberalisation of slot allocations. The Minister should reassure his hon. Friend about the Government's role in ensuring that those essential—albeit not quite so profitable—regional services continue to run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not think that I went far enough on that issue. We were really discussing the wider issue of slots. I thought that I had assured my hon. Friend that we recognise the importance of regional services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will the Government do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman always says that the Government must do something. Does he think that we should subsidise the route or write something into the law? As my hon. Friend says, that service is very important to the region as it operates at present. I know that there have been some worries about the service. As my hon. Friend said in his report, he was fairly satisfied with the service. So the hon. Gentleman is again asking us to do something when nothing is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regional airlines and air services are essential to the regions' economic development. If anything happened to the slots from Manchester at Heathrow, there would be a direct economic effect on the region. My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) and the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) are simply asking the Minister for a straightforward statement that the Government will ensure that those regional services will be maintained in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not go any further as I have already stated my position. Those services are important and it is up to the airline companies that operate them to work out how best to utilise them.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
The hon. Lady is right that the services from Manchester are important, as are those from Liverpool, Cornwall, St. Ives, north of the border in Scotland, and Newcastle. They are important services which have grown substantially over the past 10 years and I leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. As I said earlier, I should like my hon. Friend to consider, in any future arrangement, giving the Secretary of State for Transport a reserve power to allocate slots to continue regional services. Frankly, I do not think that my hon. Friend or any responsible Minister could give the assurance that the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) seeks. However, a reserve power would ensure a reasonable allocation of slots to regional services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Frined makes a valid point. I am concerned about that and I am aware of the strength of feeling. I would say to the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich and to my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives that, at the moment, the services that they mentioned account for 25 per cent of the slots at Heathrow. That is a substantial amount—about 75,000 slots a year. They will not disappear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about transatlantic services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asks about transatlantic services. She would welcome transatlantic services operating from regional airports in this country other than Manchester, but I shall get into trouble if I pursue that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should hate to get the Minister into trouble. He cannot have it both ways. He knows
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
that there are members of the CAA who would like to sell off all major airports and leave themselves with Heathrow. One easy way to find more slots for big airline carriers would be to get rid of regional airlines. All the Minister has to say is that the Government will not allow that to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady meant the BAA, not the CAA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is because I am so overwhelmed by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it is because the hon.
