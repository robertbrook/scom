	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I apologise to the Minister for intervening at this point, but I believe it is an appropriate moment to make a point that I hope hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will endorse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee is to make a useful contribution to the proceedings and to help the Government by acting as a sounding-board for the proposals, it is vital that we should prepare ourselves properly and that the relevant Department should assist us in that. The papers submitted to the Committee have not been put together nearly as helpfully as those that the Department of Employment compiled for a previous Committee; those papers were arranged chronologically, with some explanation. One might read the whole of the present papers before realising that some documents had been superseded by others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to criticise the officials in the Department of Trade and Industry but rather to help them prepare hon. Members for meetings in future. The issue is highly technical and it would be helpful for those members of the Committee who are not electronic engineers if a glossary of technical terms were provided. The "explanatory memorandum"—that for draft instrument 7573/91, because there are several such memoranda—is rather inappropriately termed, as it does not explain very much to me. Paragraph 2 is, to anyone without a technical background, complete gobbledegook. None of the technical terms is explained. It is certainly possible to provide lucid explanation of key points for the benefit of the general audience. It was done, for example, in one of the lobbying documents that I received from British Sky Broadcasting. I recommend that document to the officials in the DTI as an efficient model of how to elucidate a complicated technical issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Corporate Affairs (Mr. John Redwood)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly take the hon. Gentleman's comments into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to introduce the Department's explanatory memoranda and the draft directive, in its various versions. I shall clarify what technical issues I can in answer to questions and hon. Members may find a discussion on them helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many members of the Committee will know, I believe strongly in the importance of the role that Parliament plays in appraising and in commenting on draft European legislation and I have found the comments of many hon. Members valuable in forming the Government's negotiating position on this important matter. A scrutiny reserve remains in place around the political agreement that we reached—somewhat to our
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
surprise—on 18 and 19 December and the purpose of today's sitting is to decide whether, in the light of our discussion, that scrutiny reserve should be lifted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original Commission proposal of 9 July 1991, set out in draft instrument 7573/91, has been tabled and we have sent out explanatory memoranda. The essence of the proposal was that it promoted D2-MAC—a means of broadcasting—by making it mandatory for all new service providers to use that format. We objected strongly to forcing a specific new format on satellite broadcasters, especially as it is a format that has so far been far from successful in the marketplace. We disliked the fact that the proposal would impose an additional cost of £50 to £100 on the purchaser of every television set throughout the Community to pay for the compulsory decoders that are necessary to receive D2-MAC broadcasts. As many purchasers of television sets would not intend to pay for such a service, decoders would be redundant and there would be an additional cost to consumers of conventional PAL television broadcasts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were also against the restriction implied by the draft directive on all digital technology. At the moment, broadcasting in the European Community uses primarily the PAL system, which provides normal television services. The Americans and Japanese have been working hard on a digital system of transmission. In future, a digital system might take over from the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft directive arising from the Commission's proposal of 9 July 1991 would have prevented European companies from responding to new digital technology. It would have forced them to develop the D2-MAC and HD-MAC technology preferred in the proposal. We want to remove that restriction. One cannot be sure how the market will develop, but it could be extremely dangerous to European companies if they were debarred from a major new technology that could prove to be a world winner. That draft directive would have meant that European companies would be backward in the market, unable to meet the possible world demand for digital technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were prepared to have HD-MAC—a new product—as the standard for high-definition television within the Community, because technical experts think that it is a sensible way to service that need. We were also prepared to allow D2-MAC—an intermediate technology—to be developed in Europe for 16:9 format televisions—cinema-widescreen televisions of which a few models are available at considerable expense. D2-MAC is a sensible way of fulfilling the need to broadcast cinema-wide, rather than on the 4:3 dimensions of traditional televisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consulted widely on the proposal and our scepticism was reflected in the consultations. Several Members of Parliament have raised points with me. On 18 and 19 December we met to consider an amended Commission proposal—the subject of an explanatory memorandum of 11 December 1991 on EC document 10157/91—which went some way in our direction but still fell well short of our negotiating aims on the directive. Officials and I went to that meeting with a heavy heart about the draft proposal; we thought that it would be impossible to reach an agreement. However, many member states agreed with the British Government's reservations and supported some of our proposals to write a more acceptable measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final text of our work of 18 and 19 December was received only recently and it was circulated by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
Department as soon as possible. I believe that it—the draft minutes of the 1549 Council meeting on telecommunications held in Brussels—has now reached every member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement that was reached will not make D2-MAC compulsory for transmissions to 4:3-style televisions until 1 January 1995 and even then it will be conditional on EC funding being available for both simulcasting in PAL—the present system—and D2-MAC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the draft directive, decoders will not be compulsory, except for widescreen televisions, as they need decoders. We do not mind that, because there will be no surcharge on the price of standard televisions which receive traditional services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft directive explicitly excludes digital technology, allowing companies and broadcasters to develop digital technology in the European Community if they wish, so we shall no longer be vulnerable to a technical challenge from Japan and the United States of America which we would have been unable to answer under the original draft directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee agrees that the document represents dramatic progress, faced as we were with an inappropriate draft directive which would have done great damage to broadcasters, satellite service providers and many in the industry producing the equipment. It is important that European industry be geared to products that are saleable in the world markets and to debar digital technology could have done us damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following political agreement—if the draft directive goes through as a common position and becomes a directive, as it is likely to do, given the voting balance in the Community on the issue—there will be two other matters to sort out. First, by voluntary initiative, a memorandum of understanding will be signed by the companies and parties interested in promoting the D2-MAC and HD-MAC technology, which our companies can enter if they think it right to do so. Secondly, the Community will consider whether funding should be made available to promote that technology and to promote simulcasting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some Community circles and in the press, there has been mention of figures as large as 1,000 mecu being available for those purposes. The Government have made it clear that we want an extremely good proposal, well costed, specifying the benefits and explaining why Community money, as opposed to commercial money, is necessary for such a venture. We would also want to be sure that any such monies would be spread around the Community, rather than being concentrated in one or two companies or countries, which would be undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless there is vigorous justification of a sensible-sized programme, the Government will not give their consent. We believe that the funding proposal will come forward under article 235, so it will require unanimity and we could block it if we did not like it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final document before us is 8122/91, which is a small measure to promote a stock of material in the 16:9 cinema screen format for television. The Government have been influential in discussing how that might be arranged and in limiting the sum of money required. We did not think that it would be sensible, for example, to commission an expensive European soap as a series of programmes.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
We tried to confine the issue to support where there is a genuine need for additional expense in producing material in a new format, and for training, research and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be happy to answer questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By way of a preface to my first question to the Minister, I identify with the comments of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). I find it extremely difficult to make much sense of many
of the documents. The Opposition have neither the resources nor the time to examine them thoroughly. We certainly do not have the resources or the time to receive representations from the various interested parties who, I am sure, will have important views to convey to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently, I find it difficult to identify the relevant questions. Some Conservative Members might say that there is nothing unusual in that, and that may be so, but it is particularly difficult in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is question time. Let the hon. Gentleman ask his question and the Minister will reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister what representations the Department has received from the BBC, independent television, the Independent Television Commission, the satellite companies and the manufacturers in Britain who have a potential interest in these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Department has made it one of its purposes to find out the attitudes of all the groups that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. The Government's negotiating position is based on our judgment of the balance between their interests and their views. I think that those groups are glad that the latest version of the draft directive is very different from the original version, which could have done considerable damage to several of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first draft directive would have adversely affected not only BSkyB but BBC Enterprises and part of the BBC. Manufacturers want to ensure that the technologies agreed in western Europe are successful commercial products, but they do not want to be debarred from using rival technologies if they are to do better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson), because I, too, have great difficulty, as I am not a physicist and I have no expert knowledge of the subject. From the consumer's point of view, will this measure mean that television sets and the television service will be cheaper in the long run? Will there be uniformity not only in the 12 countries of the Community but worldwide? I recently spent a holiday in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany where the television service came from four countries: Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria. Obviously, it would be in everyone's interests to ensure that television has no frontiers and is received worldwide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to both the hon. Gentleman's questions is no. Television services will not be cheaper because of the directive. By renegotiating it we have ensured that television sets and conventional television services will not be dearer, as they would have been under the original proposal. The directive will not move us towards worldwide uniformity. Japan and the United States of America are already developing technologies different from those recommended in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
draft directive. We have kept open the opportunity for the world to move to a common digital standard in the future, when such technology is developed. That would be a welcome move which the original draft would have made more difficult, if not impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to what my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) said about the way in which the information was presented, it might help if, when there has been a series of explanatory memorandums, as with this directive, we had a list of the changes. A final memorandum that says that we agree with all that has happened requires more detailed analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main point is about subsidy on promotion. What is that subsidy intended for? If a decision were made on the future style of transmission, all the companies involved would know what was expected. An advertising promotion does not seem relevant to that. Is the subsidy intended as compensation for companies that have to change from their present approach or production to a different style?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point about highlighting changes. That would be welcome and I shall see whether in future it would be possible to incorporate details of the changes when we have a series of drafts that requires different explanatory memorandums at each stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what the subsidy would be for, which is why the British Government would not commit themselves until they had seen the proper prospectus and had solved the problems to which my hon. Friend referred. I think that some people in the Community have in mind a subsidy to the manufacturers of the equipment to try to lower their costs. They may also have in mind a subsidy to those who will use this broadcasting technique to provide the service. They may be thinking along those lines because the current models that can provide widescreenformat television are very expensive. The television sets may cost £3,000 each and the transmission system is expensive to establish. That would constitute a stockbroker service, not a service for the man in the street, thus making it more difficult for me to justify the subsidy. We shall consider carefully the commissioner's proposals to see if it makes commercial and industrial sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does my hon. Friend think that we are proceeding at all with the proposal? The main purpose of the original directive has been changed considerably. Given the rapid development of technology in the industry, it is wrong for the Community to trammel itself or its manufacturers and to get locked into a particular direction. It has already changed the basis of the directive because of a recognition of the development of other technologies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger under the directive of the European Community doing just what its enemies have always suspected that it might do, which is to act in some way as a protective mechanism for its industry. As a result, the rest of us might unnecessarily subsidise inefficient technology and cut ourselves off from world developments that will shape the television reception equipment for the future. Is my hon. Friend clear in his mind that the Commission has a proper reason to proceed, or should the proposal be shelved for some years? Should it be proceeded with at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with my hon. Friend's points. Had Britain been on her own in the negotiation, we would not have proceeded with the directive. But there was a clear wish on the part of many Community countries to have some sort of directive and many of them agreed with us that grave dangers were inherent in the original draft. When we first considered the original draft, it was not clear that we would receive such support within the Community. Indeed, we worked hard to obtain support for the justifiable fears that we and many people in commerce shared about the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an argument for establishing a recommended system for widescreen television. Standards must be laid down for national or international systems. Widescreen television is not up and running anywhere in the Community, so there is a case for such technology to be used to develop it. It is important, however, not to debar ourselves from a future technology that could be superior to others and could be developed worldwide. That is the reason behind the digital exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also narrowed the impact of the directive by confining the dates of the proposal from January 1995 to 1998, so that the Community will have the opportunity to reconsider the matter. In the period before the directive becomes fully operational, it is up to people to set up services in any technological format they like which will allow the market to develop further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on his clearly having had a major impact on the directive, by removing distortions to the market and to innovation, and on moving it in the direction of protecting consumers. He has performed a valuable task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the Japanese development of high-definition television, widescreen television, digital transmission techniques and other associated technologies. Have Government-imposed standards and Government subsidies in Japan, or any other explicit Japanese Government actions, played a part in the progress that the Japanese have made and are making in that industry? If they have, what part have they played?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Japanese have an HDTV standard, which is known as high vision. It is based on a picture of 1125 lines and it provides a higher resolution than our usual services do in this country. The commercial high-vision channel has started broadcasting via satellite eight hours a day in Japan. But HDTV sets cost about $30,000, so they have not proved too popular with consumers. The Japanese hope that prices will drop rapidly to a level that represents a better commercial prospect for the typical Japanese worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Japanese manufacturers and broadcasters are also showing great interest in clear vision. That is an enhanced version of the NTSC-National Television Standards Committee—system, which is the standard system already in use in Japan. In specific answer to my hon. Friend's questions, there was a role in Japan for the establishment of standards. I do not believe that there was a specific subsidy, but I would have to confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise for having tried to make a point of order at an inappropriate time, Mr. Hill. I was going to say that we had invited my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North (Mr. Gale) to join us and that he could have given us a three minute rundown of all the technical issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Have developments in television transmission reached a stage similar to that reached in the telephone system about 20 years ago when we were moving from analogue transmission signals to digital? Will my hon. Friend the Minister also confirm that most of the problems of incompatibility will disappear when we move to digital transmission because the digital system allows for easier manipulation of the signal than does the analogue system? Can he also confirm that there is nothing especially odd about redundant capacity in television sets, as most sets can be used anywhere in the country? There are different cards in the television that allow that. With regard to the problems of more lines on television sets, the shapes of television sets and the analogue and digital systems, will my hon. Friend confirm that we dealt with many of those issues when, several years ago, we changed from one set to another set of lines without subsidy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend's last point. It has been possible to see through major technical changes in television transmission and television set reception without subsidy and I shall bear that in mind when examining Commission proposals. My hon. Friend is right to say that television sets can often perform more functions than people use. However, I was very reluctant to see a £50 to £100 surcharge imposed on the buyer of the average set. Most people would not have the intention or financial ability to use the services that a decoder could supply over the likely life of their sets, and such a surcharge would be unacceptable. My hon. Friend may be right to say that it is easier to make digital compatible world wide with other digital systems than with the different analogue or mixed analogue/digital systems that are currently being developed. The world may decide on a digital system that allows transmissions to be made across oceans as well as across adjacent borders. That is why the European Community has preserved the opportunity to develop digital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to attend the Committee. If I catch your eye, Mr. Hill, I hope to make several of the comments to which my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) referred. Will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify the financial position? I understand his and the Government's grave concern about the possible commitment of considerable amounts of European taxpayers' money to what might be described as a wild goose chase. Can he tell us about current thinking within the Commission? Is much money likely to be committed to simulcasting—broadcasting in both MAC and PAL systems—or is current thinking now drifting towards funding programming?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a complete lack of precision in Commission thinking on the issue. I have asked Commissioner Pandolfi, the vice-president of the Commission, such questions. As a result of my questions the Council decided that it was important to have a proper proposal table. We await that table, which I hope will answer my questions and those of my hon. Friend.

Some countries favour the subsidy of simulcasting—Germany was especially vocal in the negotiations, arguing for simulcasting in both PAL and the relevant MAC system, and I believe that it had a form of subsidy in mind. Other countries are keener on a subsidy for manufacturers. They have been lobbied by specific manufacturers in their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
territories and believe that money should go to manufacturers as compensation for some of the development costs of the equipment required. The Committee will have to await proper clarification of the Commission's aims. As a necessary discipline, it should put forward a properly costed paper explaining why subsidy is important, who would and who would not receive a subsidy, and why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is to be congratulated on the way in which he has conducted the negotiations with our 11 European partners. I do not know whether he or my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) is the Minister for Consumer Affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah. Does my hon. Friend know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is satisfied that the directive is in the interests of consumers, bearing in mind the fact that the answer will affect the way in which I vote on the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: DTI Ministers speak with one voice on Government policy. My hon. Friend may rest assured that I have spoken to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle and that he is satisfied with the point that we have reached in the negotiations—as against the point from which we started—and is happy to recommend the draft directive to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on having set a precedent this morning. This is the first occasion on which I can recall a Minister answering questions when the chairs to the right of the Chairman have been empty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the memorandum of understanding intended to achieve and what will happen if some do not sign it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a voluntary initiative, so people will sign the memorandum of understanding only if they think that it makes sense to them and is in their commercial interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the vice-president of the Commission has it in mind that the memorandum of understanding between the interested commercial parties, who could be manufacturers and service providers, will set out how they intend to promote the new format and style of service under the directive. Of course, they will have to be careful that they do not indulge in anti-competitive practices. The point has been raised with the vice-president that, while the parties may be able to make statements and concert their efforts in some respects to promote that particular format and style of broadcasting, they must take care to ensure that they do not create a cartel, which would be against Community competition rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that caveat, it is for the vice-president and the commercial interests to decide what form of statement and agreement is appropriate to allow them to pool their resources and develop an interest in high-definition television and D2-MAC technology for widescreen television.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to follow up questions raised by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson), who asked how people involved in television broadcasting and manufacture felt about the directive, and the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North (Mr. Gale).

I understand that, because of changes, the Commission's proposals are now acceptable, as they omit the restraint that was in the earlier proposals, subject to ideas on where European funding might go. Will my hon. Friend make available to those hon. Members who have attended the Committee any detailed proposals that come from the European Commission? That will make it possible, either in this Committee, or by other means in the House, to give our views on whether those further ideas on how to spend whatever amount is thought appropriate are stupid or sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The earlier we can see the Commission's proposals, the sooner it will be possible to say whether the ideas are good or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that will be possible. Certainly, I should value advice from the Committee, or through another parliamentary channel, on the funding proposals. I shall ensure that they are sent to the right body in the House so that there can be scrutiny of that measure before we finally negotiate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to consultation, my officials have had two formal consultation meetings at which a wide range of interested parties were represented, as well as numerous bilateral meetings and informal discussions with the major interest groups that I mentioned earlier. The details of our consultation are set out more fully in the explanatory memorandum of 6 November 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.4 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 7573/91 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memoranda submitted by the Department of Trade and Industry on 6th November and 11th December 1991 and 10157/91 relating to standards for satellite broadcasting of television signals and 8122/91 relating to audio-visual production in the context of the strategy for high definition television; and endorses the Government's approach which is to aim for the correct balance between promoting new broadcasting technologies, protecting the rights of satellite broadcasters and serving the best interests of consumers.—	<i>[Mr. Redwood.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doug Henderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall not oppose the Government on this matter. That does not mean that we agree wholeheartedly with the Government's every move; we shall reserve our position until we are better able to reflect on the representations that a Labour Government will receive in three months' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would have had difficulties with the original draft. I acknowledge the efforts of all concerned in getting it replaced with a more effective proposal. Four points raised in those discussions make sense. First, it makes sense to have a recommended standard for widescreen television—preferably one that is internationally agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, following representations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), who suggested that digital technology is the technology of the future, it makes sense to await developments on that front before we commit ourselves to future changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it clearly makes sense to protect existing interests—our national television and satellite channels—and, where possible, to protect our manufacturing interests. However, I am not clear what those are or how they would be affected; a Labour Government would want to receive far more detailed representations on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, it makes sense to hold back for a while, to avoid the mistakes made by the Americans in relation to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
colour television. They jumped a little too early and the resulting American standard is probably less effective than ours. However, in holding back, we may miss the opportunity to play a leading role in the development of the new technology and miss the spin-off benefits that would accrue. Unless we are able to take an early initiative, we may become wholly dependent on Japanese or American technology and capital. Against that, a European development that was too narrow and was geared solely to rescuing European companies that had not undertaken sufficient research and development to ensure a worthwhile product, would favour no one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not much more that I can usefully say. When such complex technical issues come before us, it is much more desirable that our discussions should be held in a Committee such as this than in another type of Committee or later in the day in the Chamber, as they previously were. It would help to have a summary of the timetable and to know the nature of the decisions that had to be taken, in addition to having background papers. As the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt) said, we need an explanatory memorandum to explain the memorandum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.9 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thanet, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, as I said earlier, for the opportunity to make a few observations on a subject that I have been studying for a long time, first as a professional television producer and director and, latterly, as a Member of Parliament. I hope that you, Mr. Hill, will forgive me, a guest, if I abuse your hospitality by speaking for too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his stand during the discussions on the draft directives. He was generous enough to say that some other countries now supported the view taken by the British Government. If so, that is largely, if not entirely, due to the fact that my hon. Friend is probably the only Minister in Europe who has a true grasp of the subject and that he has managed to educate some of his colleagues in the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that my hon. Friend has secured major advances—if not in total limitation, at least in damage control—in the draft directive, which is a very different document from that which he was originally required to consider. However, I share the view expressed earlier that the prospects before us are highly undesirable. My hon. Friend will understand that I mean no criticism of his negotiations. He is stuck with the fact that the European Commission and some Ministers seem to be determined to issue a directive now. For reasons that I hope to explain, I cannot think of a worse time for them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A community directive issued on 5 December 1991 says in the third paragraph on page 2:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whereas HD-MAC has been developed as the European transmission standard for HDTV services based on those criteria of compatibility and evolution and D2-MAC offers the best available path towards the development of HDTV with wide-screen 16:9 D2-MAC as the main step in that direction".</p></blockquote>
That sums up the Commission's attitude on the subject. It has made an historic commitment to the MAC transmission system, so we must ask ourselves why we are where we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout Europe, major political and technical reputations have been staked on the MAC format. Two very large companies, Philips and Thomson, have committed vast resources to the development of the MAC
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
format and have been backed, through the Eureka programme, by the European Community. Some of the best technical players in the United Kingdom have also thrown their weight behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MAC programme, a superb piece of engineering, is about as much use now as the Brabazon or possibly even Concorde, two superb pieces of engineering which led to many other major developments but which, in themselves, were not successful worldwide. Some might quarrel with my assessment of Concorde, but my comments are certainly applicable to the Bristol Brabazon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may remember from the early days of video recorders a box about 8 in by 2·5 in, which was a Philips video cassette. Philips put enormous sums of money into the development of what quickly became a totally redundant video recorder. The company lost. It put its eggs into that basket and lost great sums of money. That is not to say that the engineers were not good or that they did not put sufficient expertise into it. Even the Beta system fell by the wayside and most people in most countries now use VHS for domestic purposes—although not exclusively for professional purposes, where Beta is used. The others failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
MAC is in this category. The time has come for Europe to acknowledge that fact and to get on the right bandwagon. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) was correct to say that there is a grave danger that Europe, not just the United Kingdom, will miss out. All is not lost, however. In the development of the MAC system, which stretched the narrow screen to a wider cinema format screen, the engineers had to use digital technology to fill in the edges, so we do not lack digital technology in the United Kingdom and in Europe. That is the path that we must tread.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must now discard the wrapping and get rid of MAC. We must recognise the fact that some people made wrong decisions. We all make wrong decisions from time to time, on both sides of the House and throughout Europe. There is no shame in acknowledging that, but there is some shame if we nail our colours to the wrong mast and do not recognise our mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will have received briefing papers from Ray Gallagher of BSkyB. I wish to pay a quick tribute to Mr. Gallagher for the briefing service that he has provided to me and, I believe, to other hon. Members. He has resources that some of us would like but do not have and has made it his business to travel the world to attend conferences to ensure that he and his company are well briefed. I believe that the House will benefit as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Gallagher's package included an article from 	<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> of 23 January. That is an American newspaper which, not surprisingly perhaps, is backing American systems. However, the article is erudite and well informed and it deserves attention. Its author is Mr. Alfred Sikes, who is an authority on the subject, and he comments on the Japanese commitment to HDTV. My hon. Friend the Minister said that the Japanese have spent vast sums on launching HDTV, which is viewed by almost as many people as, dare I say it, those who watch the televised House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article asks:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why, then, did Japan stick with an analog standard, and why is Europe poised to follow? Industrial policy., Europe's politicians, joined by industrialists unwilling to see beyond their own sunk costs,"</p></blockquote>
—he sums it up perfectly—
	<br><blockquote><p>"decided to decree where video technology and markets were going. Japan's shotgun wedding with analog similarly gave her scientists little reason to flirt with other technologies. In each case, policy makers worried less about world-class products than about first ensuring that their advanced TV standard was made at home."</p></blockquote>
The Japanese and the Europeans have done that and so have the Americans, but the Americans seem to be coming out on top.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article starts:
	<br><blockquote><p>"American-led advances in digital technology are likely to render Japan's and Europe's plans for high-definition television obsolete long before they reach the mass market. As this new-and-improved television comes into focus, there's a big-picture lesson emerging for governments: Bureaucrats determined to freeze the frame on fast-moving industries lock their companies and citizens into second-class products."</p></blockquote>
That is precisely what the European Commission is trying to do. Left to our own devices without the intervention of the Minister, there is no question but that we would now be locked into yesterday's technology and left behind. There is still a grave danger that the matter will go before the European Parliament and that the draft directive may be amended again, but at least we have made some progress, due largely to the intervention of my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that members of the Committee have received a copy of the letter sent to M. Delors by the professor of media technology at the media laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is regarded as the leading institute in this sphere of technology. For the record, the letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On Sunday, December 15th, a group of senior executives convened at the U.N. Plaza for an Ad Hoc Summit on Global Harmony for Digital Television. Europe, Japan and the United States were represented, as were the five commercial sectors; terrestrial broadcast, satellite broadcast, cable, telephony and packaged media. Of major interest to you in your final deliberations on D2- and HD-MAC is the unanimous agreement that digital implementation of all television systems, including PAL, NTSC, and HDTV, is immediate—not far off. Certain participants felt unable to be listed below because of the strong political forces at play."</p></blockquote>
The letter lists all who were present and they included every major player in the technology, except those who declined to be listed because of commercial considerations. The latter included Joseph Donague, senior vice-president of Thomson Consumer Electronics, which has an interest in Europe, and the Cable Laboratories consortium, one of the biggest players. Included among those likely to take a lead are the well-known companies of the Hughes corporation of America, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Apple Computer, Northern Telecom and Sony.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the biggest companies in the western world have committed themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At this point in history, legislation of D2-MAC or HD-MAC would set Europe behind by a decade. I am sure some of the Japanese will be content to see Europe make the same mistake they have."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that they would, and the short-term recovery of misplaced investment is what the commitment of European taxpayers' money is really about.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Short-term recovery of misplaced development dollars should not deprive the citizens of Europe a position at the edge of a new program and its service opportunities."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
On the agreement that arose from that summit on global harmony for digital television sets, he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We the undersigned unanimously agree that digital television transmission will be operational in 1992, be in the home by 1994, and be designed to scale smoothly to high definition before 1995."</p></blockquote>
On several occasions, during the Committee stage of the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984 and latterly during the Broadcasting Bill, I have commented on the future of digital technology. I must confess that I have been wrong twice when I said that digital transmission would be with us within two years. However, it is not just I who says that now. Some of the most important people in the development field are saying that digital technology will be in the home by 1994—yet we in Europe are trying to nail our colours to a mast that is collapsing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Favell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee will be very interested by my hon. Friend's points. Have he or his advisers made estimates of the likely amount of European taxpayers' money that would be wasted on the plan, if they turn out to be right in their forecast?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that must be no, simply because, as my hon. Friend the Minister said earlier, we await with great interest the European Community's proposal. It would be wrong to say that all the money invested in the MAC programme would be wasted because, as I said, some of that money is connected with digital technology. It would probably be very difficult to distinguish the part of the total investment in MAC by Thomson, by Philips, and through the Eureka programme which pertains solely to MAC transmission from the part that pertains to the development of television transmissions generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I craved your indulgence, Mr. Hill, and if any member of the Committee feels that I am abusing your tolerance and patience by continuing to speak, I hope that he will say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final nail in the MAC coffin must be one very simple fact. The MAC transmission standard is designed only for satellite transmission. It will not work for terrestrial transmission. The failure of British Sky Broadcasting using the MAC system was really the end of that commercial venture. That should be recognised. Members of the Committee will know that I vehemently opposed the use of the Marco Polo MAC satellite for House of Commons broadcasting, because it was immediately apparent that that would have a very restricted audience—what my hon. Friend the Minister called, tongue-in-cheek, the stockbroker audience. I must say as an aside that I am saddened that the House is not yet able to receive the transmission of its own debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast to the MAC systems, digital broadcasting is applicable to terrestrial and to satellite transmissions. That means that even if we in the United Kingdom wish to preserve terrestrial transmission—I do not know if we will, since we already have 35 universally available cable systems—there may not be a place for terrestrial transmission of domestic television entertainment. There will certainly be terrestrial transmission, but it may be used for other purposes. In the interim period, there is clearly a demand for terrestrial transmission serving the United Kingdom alone and if we are to make the quantum leap from the PAL system to HDTV, we must choose a system that allows us to continue with terrestrial transmission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
The only existing support for the MAC system comes from Eurocrats who stake their reputation on that system. We have all received the briefing papers and we know that some issues must be monitored carefully, especially the possibility that the European Parliament might decide to amend some parts of the directive. As an aesthetic aside, it must be borne in mind that those with Astra receivers would have to have a dish twice the size of the one already in place to receive MAC transmission. People are already complaining bitterly about the carbuncle satellite dishes appearing around our "cityscape". The thought of all those dishes being replaced with dishes twice the size is awful. It is for that reason why I have always advocated that the way forward for delivery to the home will be through cable systems, but it will take time for those systems to be developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the digital system offer us? Someone who is wiser than me and who knows the subject well, Dr. Brian Evans, provided a fair analogy. He briefed many hon. Members who considered the Broadcasting Act 1990. He said that the analogue transmission system is similar to baking a cake, wrapping it and sending it through the post. If the postman dropped it or kicked it around, it is likely to suffer and its quality on arrival would not be good. The digital transmission system is the equivalent to taking the ingredients of the cake, making the cake, taking it to pieces, down to its original constituent parts, and then sending it through the post, and re-making the cake in a perfect form at the other end, as a result of which it would be of a much more reliability quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Digital transmission provides another tremendous opportunity for us. It is the language of voice telephony, of computers, of television sound and of a great deal of radio sound. Digital pictures are already available in entertainment, but when we acquire that same quality of television digital pictures, we shall see on the horizon a no-turnstile system in which voice telephony, computer software and entertainment are interchangeable. The prospects for home shopping, home entertainment, home medicine and other facilities will suddenly become a reality. It would be devastating if Europe was left behind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with almost everything that the hon. Gentleman has said. Is it not true that digital transmissions require a greater band width than is available from satellite?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be better informed technically than I am. Dr. Evans has developed a system called "the Evans box", and he believes that, for each terrestrial transmission, he could secure three digital bands. Therefore, far from requiring a greater band width, it would be possible to secure more channels. From the 12 existing channels in the United Kingdom, 36 terrestrial channels could be created. I am not a technical expert, nor do I wish to present myself as one. But I understand that more bands can be secured because, on each side of a terrestrial PAL channel, there is a taboo channel. Because the technology is imprecise, there is what could be called a spill-over. For example, let us imagine vehicles which have a tendency to go off on to the hard shoulders on either side of a road. It is, therefore, necessary to have the hard shoulders. That is not the case with digital transmission as its technology is more precise, so the hard shoulders can be used for other transmissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that satellite digital transmission requires a greater band width. But its overall impact would mean
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
that, far from creating fewer opportunities for new bands, there would be more opportunities. Of course, I stand to be corrected technically. I do not want to quarrel with the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), who believes otherwise. He may be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the Home Office explanatory memorandum dated 26 November 1991 in which the Under-Secretary of State set out the policy implications. Paragraph 9 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"None at this stage but a watching brief will be necessary to ensure that the work of the MEDIA Investment Club does not extend into areas which would damage the interests of UK broadcasters and viewers."</p></blockquote>
I hope that I have dealt satisfactorily with the MAC, digital and PAL transmission standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now dealt with European money and programming, which is another pillar, to use the European term, of the document. My hon. Friend the Minister said that the Government were not wildly enthusiastic about investing large sums of European money in simulcast. That would be akin to pouring European taxpayers' money down the drain. To transmit in MAC is ridiculous enough, but to subsidise companies to transmit in MAC so that no one can watch it is utterly ridiculous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also not enamoured of the thought that European taxpayers' money will be used to subsidise manufacturers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should recognise that the EC has a long and honourable tradition of using people's money to subsidise things that nobody wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still believe in the story of Saul on the way to Damascus. It is possible to have an overnight change. I shall now probably be accused of believing in fairies at the bottom of the garden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for us to subsidise European manufacturers. The documents include some points that this country and Europe should have adopted long ago. During our discussions on the Cable and Broadcating Bill in 1984, many of us believed that the Home Office and the Department of Trade and Industry should determine together that every television set sold after 1990 in the United Kingdom would have a peri-television socket. We believed that televisions would require decoders, perhaps because we would wish to move to subscription television—if someone pays for a programme, there must be a method of coding and decoding it. If we had done that, television production throughout Europe would have received the fillip, or, rather, the encouragement that it needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a new generation of television sets. The widescreen format will be available very soon. That will provide tremendous opportunities for European television makers. They should seize those opportunities, but they should not make sets that no one will want to buy. Costs have been estimated at £3,000 or $30,000 in Japan for a MAC television receiver. Those figures are unrealistic—they compare with prices for the early colour television sets, which were status symbols. No one will pay such a price. However, when the widescreen sets become available, people will want them and the prices will drop through sheer volume. I see no case for putting European money into simulcast or into support for manufacturers of, and thus investment in, the wrong product. We did not support Philips when it produced the wrong video recorders; we should not support anyone for backing the wrong horse now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
If the European Community is determined to spend money—I am not sure that it is right to do so—that money might be well spent on programmes. A long time ago, I worked for Universal Pictures. Universal films are still dominant in the world television and film market. Before the advent of television, that company—with tremendous stupidity according to some, and with foresight according to others—ploughed enormous sums of money into films that it put on shelves. Americans believed that Universal would go bust. It made many films for which there was no market in the cinema. It was clear that the company could not sustain its production programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then came television. Literally overnight, Universal's shelves were cleared because there was a voracious demand for products, but no product was available except from Universal Pictures. That is how the company established a dominance in the market which it has maintained ever since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are not to allow the Americans to establish a dominance in that market we should look seriously now at widescreen format: in three years' time it will be too late, as digital pictures will be with us. The beauty of widescreen format is that widescreen programmes can be transmitted on D2-MAC for the four people who will watch it; it can be squeezed for transmission, as a cinemascope film can be transmitted, on a PAL screen; and it will be available, provided that we make the right programmes, for a European market when digital pictures transmission is with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At page 6, paragraph (c) of the communication of 24 July 1991 to Parliament and the Council on encouraging audiovisual production, the Commission says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a need to encourage producers in countries with a smaller capacity for audiovisual production."</p></blockquote>
That scares the daylights out of me. Are we seriously saying that we are to put money into European production in countries that do not have the capacity to produce programmes? If we are, there is no chance of our being able to compete with the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our real commitment must be to developing a European industry that is capable of taking the United States and Japan head on and beating them at their own game. There is no reason why we should not do that, but we shall not do so if we follow the Commission's suggestion and simply encourage a small producer here and a small producer there. I have great sympathy with the people of Liechtenstein, which has no television industry, but we cannot get away from the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Hill, have served on the Council of Europe and, more than most, are probably aware of the ability of European bureaucrats to impose control over absolutely everything at standards that meet the lowest common denominator. If we are to compete with the American market, we must match the highest denominator, because that is what the Americans will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What programmes shall we produce? DG 10's media programme suggested a series of advanced production. It will not have escaped hon. Members' notice that the acronym for that is SOAP. Apparently, Europe would like to produce through DG 10's media programme what has been described as a politically correct soap opera. I shudder to think what a "politically correct soap opera" means to every one of the 15 people in this Room. If we are to make a soap opera that seems politically correct to the 500 million people of Europe, it will be a pretty bland product and one that not many will watch. The millions of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
ecus that it will cost to make it may well exceed in number the millions of viewers who will not watch it. If we are to produce such programmes, we must ensure that European taxpayers' money is used properly and targeted carefully. We must all understand what we are trying to do, which is to produce a bank of widescreen products that will enable us in 1994 to compete with the Americans in the same market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way forward is to scrap the commitment to MAC-HDTV; to put maximum effort into the development of European digital television through, if necessary, 1,250 lines enhanced definition television; and, if we are to put any money in, we must make sure that it goes only into good, widely acceptable, widescreen production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Burt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North (Mr. Gale) has vindicated one purpose of the Committee, which is to provide an opportunity for expert comment on European documents. We are grateful to my hon. Friend. With his expertise he has managed to explain the directive in terms that are understandable even to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an extra reason to pay tribute to my hon. Friend. Last summer we were both guests at a conference in Moscow. We were asked, as British representatives, to deliver a presentation. To my great surprise and concern my hon. Friend had to leave early, so I had to give a presentation on this topic. My hon. Friend identified the dangers of the directive, and, addressing a pan-European audience, he expressed the same concerns as he has today. In the meantime, those concerns have been picked up by the Government and by the Minister, who has dealt with them in the manner described. Whatever knowledge and experience I have on the subject is due to my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North introducing me to the mysteries of MAC, PAL, Secam and so on, and I should like to thank him for that. I am pleased that he was able to attend the Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's speech exposed one of the flaws of these Committees. I mention this matter in the hope that it will be taken into account when we consider how to reconstruct these Committees in the future. If my hon. Friend had not spotted this discussion on the programme and if we had dealt with the matter without him, we would have been short of expertise on the subject. That reinforces the need for hon. Members to have expertise available to them before they question Ministers. It has been suggested that one of the Clerks of the Select Committees with relevant knowledge could give us a half hour technical briefing on the subject of the day. Recently, we have discussed nuclear fusion, the requirements of gas water heaters throughout Europe and the English law of contract. The Committee cannot do its job if it has to deal with such a wide variety of subjects without expert assistance. Relying on the chance attendance of colleagues who know the subject does not seem the best way of going about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the same technical detail as my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North (Mr. Gale), but I should like to comment on two matters that caught my attention. I am a strong believer in the European Community and an advocate of all that it can do. I believe in working together in as wide a field as possible. However, that concept only has validity if we get it right. The danger that has been identified in Committee is that for all the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
wrong reasons the Community made a decision based on the need to subsidise a strand of manufacturing that Europe thought was in its best interest. It ran the serious danger of backing the wrong horse. If that is what Europe amounts to in the future, we are wasting our time. It is not what Europe should be about. It is right to draw attention to that danger and warn Europe off this sort of technological backing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When should subsidies be given? My hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North was right to mention the Media programme, into which we might put effort and investment. It is a difficult issue because the decision to commit resources to assist manufacturing inevitably involves difficult choices about winners and losers, which my hon. Friend the Minister knows well enough. He feels that these matters are often better left to the market. That is entirely true in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the European Community should not become a protective mechanism. We do not want resources to be used in a way that would lead us into a cul-de-sac. That raises questions about the Community's trading status and its relationship with other major partners around the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we have caught this problem in time and I hope that the Community thinks again about the directive. Any attempt to prevent technological development in other parts of the world and to harness and commit resources to one strand of such development will lead either to massive investment that will subsequently go wrong or to the provision of Community services that are manifestly inferior to those provided in the rest of the world. Any such development would be fundamentally wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not fancy the idea of a politically correct European soap. All sorts of images come to mind of how it might be introduced. One would be, "Hello Otto, this is my boyfriend: he is a stockbroker but also a hunt saboteur." That is one way of starting, a series of characters being developed along those lines. We could have a lot of fun with that, but I would not like to see my constituent's money going into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North for what he said this morning. I also thank my hon. Friend the Minister for the way in which he has dealt with the European proposals over the past months. I hope that he will keep the same degree of scepticism on this occasion. As a fervent friend of the Community, I want to see the Community get it right. That is where Britain does best—working with our partners, but pointing out to them, constructively, the error of their ways. I hope that that will be our pathway, not only on this matter, but in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt) said about my hon. Friend the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North (Mr. Gale). To some extent, our debate follows the action. That is reasonable, because the Government do not always get it right although, in this case, they have. Tribute should also be paid to the Scrutiny Committee, because, without its preliminary work, we should not have had the chance to consider the draft document. I hope that the members of the Scrutiny Committee and those who serve the Committee—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
including those who write answers to the Scrutiny Committee's questions—will feel that their work was worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to go a stage further than my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North. In this country, we have the habit of being both practical and farsighted. On technical matters and especially in broadcasting, we tend to get things right because we work on what is practical. There is an immense cost pressure on our broadcasters, and we now have much expertise in developing the markets for new products. We pick up new products—for instance, video recorders and other bits of technology—as fast as Japan, Hong Kong and other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need also to be far sighted. I pay tribute to the European Commission for trying to develop compatible standards. However, the Commission found itself on a road without a destination—or a road with a brick wall at the end. It started by saying that there was one area of opportunity, then provided constraints. Instead of saying that it would be a good idea if we used television screens that could receive pictures of a different shape and asking how that could be achieved, it found itself saying that unless it constricted what was done—unless it was made universal—some of the money that might be used to produce programmes would be wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hesitate to raise a party political point, because it is not part of Labour's programme, but it was suggested that one way to fund the BBC was to put a levy on television sets. I calculated that that would increase the cost of each television set by £300 if sets lasted for only four or five years. I doubt whether that idea will be pursued. The European proposal would have led to an extra £50 to £100 for every television set. That may not seem much to those who spend £700 or £800 on large sets with stereo sound and so on. But many people spend only £140 on new television sets. That is what some new televisions cost down at the Co-op in Eltham high street, or in its competitor shops. Adding £50 to £100 means that the minimum cost of a new television set will be increased by 50, 60 or 80 per cent. That is worth avoiding; we must allow the choice, which is why the adaptation of the Commission's proposals is to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to give the idea that there should be a subsidy for simultaneous broadcasting. When we were changing from one standard to another, our broadcasters had to broadcast in two standards. What is more, they were able to use semi-commercial judgment about when to end broadcasts in the old standard. If there had been a public subsidy, there would have been a public row, and the mere prospect of one person trying to use a television set on the old standard would have brought sufficient political pressure for public funding to have continued. It is better not to start public subsidies because they are difficult to cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it will be possible for the Commission to go on with its constructive work. At the risk of boring hon. Members, I recommend the approach of Karel van Miert, the Belgian commissioner, who brought together a group of road safety experts who produced a report called the Gerondeau report, outlining what was right for legislation and what was wrong, and the area in between where some flexibility was desirable. The aim was to decide what would work best, to delay statutory requirements for as long as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
possible and, if practicable, to avoid them altogether. That approach was practical and farsighted: it was based not on what could be preserved for Europe but on what Europe, and others could be allowed to develop that would benefit Europe. That seems to be the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the present saga can be brought to a relatively happy conclusion legislatively, that will be most welcome. However, I echo the warning of Ray Gallagher—incidentally I support the tributes to his briefing note—who said that it is possible that the European Parliament will try to get its way even though the Commission and the Council of Ministers have produced a better adaptation of the original proposals. I hope that the European Parliament will pay attention to people such as my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North who say that there is a better way forward for Europe in not trying to make the standard too European.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.51 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With your permission, Mr. Hill, I shall reply to the points raised in our excellent debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the Labour party agrees with the Government that the original draft was dangerous and that, if there are to be recommended standards, they should apply to widescreen TV and not to others. I am pleased that the Labour party shares my worry about excluding digital technology. No doubt the Opposition will accept that we have carefully reserved the position of digital technology in the new draft so that Europe will not be debarred from developing digital styles of equipment and transmission if that is the way that the world market goes. I am pleased that they agree also that we have done our best to protect existing interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) asked about United Kingdom equipment manufacturing and wondered whether we had done enough to consult manufacturers. I explained earlier that we consulted widely—both bilaterally and in special meetings. The Sony company, which is perhaps the largest manufacturer of televisions in the United Kingdom.—it is certainly an important exporter of them—is happy with the changes made as a result of the British negotiating position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amstrad is pleased with the changes; it has an important position in both the satellite receiving equipment market in the United Kingdom, and throughout the European Community, where it has 35 per cent. of the dishes market—partly because it has developed a good domestic base in this country. The United Kingdom was a pioneer of satellite services receiving dishes through the very successful B Sky B. Some 2·5 million people in the United Kingdom are able to receive satellite services either through antennae or cable—a high degree of penetration compared with that of many other Community countries. We tried to take full account of our manufacturers' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the United Kingdom is now a net exporter by value of television sets and that new investors have come here to produce. We wish to ensure that the EC has the right framework of standards and regulation to enable those companies to flourish in world markets also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North asked whether we had played a leading role. We have, and we shall continue to do so. We have played a leading role in developing the legislative proposals, and the United
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
Kingdom in general has played a leading role in many relevant areas of technology as my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North (Mr. Gale) said in his excellent speech. We have been a leader in satellite broadcasting. The directive was ostensibly intended to promote satellite broadcasting and one could do worse than to study the pattern of developments in the United Kingdom market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about Japanese subsidy and standards. I said that to the best of my knowledge there was no Government subsidy, but that I would check it. I am advised that there has been extensive state-owned broadcasting subsidy for HDTV development in Japan. That is how some of the costs have been met there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of digital technology also arise and hon. Members asked whether it required greater band width. My technical advice is that, of today, if the same quality is to be achieved, it would required extra band width. However, much work is being done in the United States on compression, and that may result in the benefits to which my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North referred. He is right that certain aspects of television channels that are not easy to use now can be used in digital technology. That lends advantage to using digital systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North made a powerful and useful intervention. I thank him and other members of the Committee for their comments about the Government's negotiating position. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend in his passionate plea for digital technology to be allowed to flourish. We have achieved that objective by excluding digital technology from the draft directive. A previous draft would have prevented digital technology in specified ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend may like to know that at the end of negotiations on 18 and 19 December, all the countries represented at the table agreed with our proposals, which were therefore carried unanimously. That required the Commission to change its draft proposal. The Commission was reluctant to do so, which meant that we had to stay until we had reached unanimity. The Commission can be obliged to make changes only if all member states are agreed. A qualified majority is not enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened was most welcome. We started from a base from which we thought we might have the support of Spain and Luxembourg, but we were not sure that we had the 23 votes necessary for a blocking minority. In the end and for a variety of reasons we gained the support of all member states. The force of our argument was accepted and the advantage of our proposals was recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be profitable to ask the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to make an informal, unofficial collection of cases over which the European Commission or the Council of Ministers adapted their position or changed their mind. I am not seeking to attack the Commission, which does a difficult job with limited resources. However, it would be useful to have some case studies to which Ministers and officials could refer. They could then say that television, minibus, gas cooker or other issues were relevant. It could save time and improve the processes of consultation, discussion and negotiation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will draw the attention of ministerial colleagues to my hon. Friend's remarks. There may well be merit in his idea. We are always trying to learn from successes and failures in negotiating within the European
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Community. Some of us gain experience and the opportunity to employ appropriate skills with varying degrees of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality and range of technical advice was most important in these specific negotiations. The Committee has had an excellent debate because members have taken it upon themselves to master the technical issues. We have been graced by the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North who has made a serious study of the technical issues over many years, and that has helped us a great deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we first began to discuss the issues around the ministerial table in the EC, I was conscious of the fact that many technical matters were outside the normal ministerial purview, and that a single strand of technical advice was coming from the Commission, which was strongly oriented towards MAC and very hostile towards digital technology. I therefore sought the advice of others who believe in digital technology to try to form a more balanced judgment—as a non-technical person—about the relative merits of the different systems and the impact that the directive might have on their development in different EC countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I heard the American argument, I was persuaded that there was something in it. It made me sceptical about the idea of wedding Europe solely to MAC technology because the day might come when the digital system worked very well and we should then be left very exposed. That is perhaps the most important change. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North agrees that we have taken care of his main worry by exempting digital technology so prominently in the draft directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found it invaluable to have access to other technical advice, which I sought from companies and commercial interests. Plainly, the MAC advice within the Community came from a commercial interest. That needed balancing in our debates around the ministerial table and in the official debates that paralleled those ministerial negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North made a robust case against any money being spent under a Commission proposal in this area. As I have tried to make clear, the British Government start from the proposition that all Community monies must be properly accounted for and the case for their expenditure well argued. We still await a proposal before we can begin to examine it and decide whether it will bring benefits to the Community's customers and businesses that would justify expenditure. In the light of this morning's debate I am strengthened in my resolve to be sceptical about such a proposal; hon. Members on both sides of the Committee seem worried about the idea of spending a lot of money, with no apparent goods on offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North that politically correct soap operas could be uninviting and not a suitable case for the expenditure of Community money. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt), I wonder what a politically correct soap opera would comprise, but I fear that I should not enjoy it very much and, I suspect, nor would many of my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North said that it was important that the Community should not make decisions to subsidise. I reassure my hon. Friend that the decisions before us today do not include a decision to subsidise anything. That will come later, when we have the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
Commission proposal for funding. That proposal must be under article 235, which requires unanimity; that will give us considerable leverage—rather more than we had in these negotiations, which were conducted under qualified majority voting. Therefore, we always had to be careful to ensure that we had several countries in agreement with us to enable us to move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North that it is usually right to leave technology to the marketplace and that is largely what we do. Perhaps my hon. Friend would agree, however, that sometimes it is sensible to establish a standard to which people can produce. It is always difficult to judge exactly when that standard should be set and there will always be a row about what it should comprise. If it is done too soon, what the market might produce is not known; if it is done comparatively late in the process, there will be quite a lot of losers who will have backed other technologies that have not been incorporated. It is a difficult judgment to make. I hope that we are making it in the right way in this draft directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind my hon. Friends the Members for Thanet, North and for Bury, North about the dates. Under the draft directive, new services are mandatory under the MAC system only from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 1998, when the directive will need renewal or it will expire. That is very different from the original proposal, under which the mandatory requirement on a much wider range of services would have come in at a much earlier date and have lasted for much longer. I hope that that helps my hon. Friends who were worried about that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) said that often British commercial interests can be both practical and farsighted. I agree with him. We have tried to reflect that in our negotiations in the European Community on this and on many other directives. We want to discuss the detail and the practicalities and not vague, general theories. I agree with my hon. Friend that, whenever possible, we want enabling measures—ones that open up opportunities—rather than restrictive measures that can become constraints on trade and, indeed, can damage the future economic and industrial development of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have learnt from this debate that there is a strong scepticism in the Committee about subsidy of any kind. I shall take account of that view in our negotiations on the money issues. I shall also ensure that any proposal is sent to the correct authorities in the House for early scrutiny. We should lift the scrutiny reserve on the draft directive because we cannot improve on its shape and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North pointed out, there are many ways in which it could be made worse. If we keep it in this form, it has a good chance of being accepted, whatever the European Parliament may say. However, if we try to tamper with it further, we could end up with a worse proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the comments in the Committee have renewed my worries about incorporating exclusive technologies in legislation, particularly if the legislation has a long shelf-life and there is no obvious way of amendment or revision. I want the United Kingdom presidency of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
Single Market Council to consider as a priority whether the legislation that has been agreed so far is made too restrictive by imposing exclusive technologies, and whether that could become an anti-competitive problem and a danger for Community-based industries that are debarred by directive and Community law from developing technologies that will have wider global appeal. That could apply across the board. I hope that the Committee will endorse the Government's action so far and is happy with those replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. The point of order that I made at the beginning of the sitting was seconded by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. One of our problems is that different teams of civil servants prepare the briefing papers for each sitting. So, although the civil servants present today heard what was said, that will not help to solve the problem. Would it be possible, via our Clerk, to give general guidance to all Whitehall Departments that are likely to send papers to the Committee on how to set out those papers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If you were to take this suggestion further, Mr. Hill, you would doubtless want to cover many other points. I am sure that the Committee would agree that such guidance should include an instruction to bind together the papers in chronological or other logical order, and not simply to throw them into an envelope, as happened on this occasion. It should be made clear when one document in the package replaces another; and when the matter is technical—as it was today—a glossary of technical terms should be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill. Those who prepare the papers for the Committee often face certain difficulties. It is important—and this is no reflection on the papers for today's debate—to have an index at the front to identify the papers. A chronological list of events and of the papers that have followed or preceded them would be helpful, but no Department has provided that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend that reading the report of the Scrutiny Committee is probably the best way into the issues. We should pay tribute to those who manage to compress complicated matters into paragraphs that most of us can understand most of the time, although I accept that not everyone is as familiar with the difference between analogue and digital transmissions as my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
