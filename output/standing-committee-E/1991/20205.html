	<p>[SIR MICHAEL SHAW 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Tobacco Products</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentry Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Stephen Dorrell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Michael, it may help the Committee if I make a brief statement setting out the Government's view on the draft directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have consistently opposed the proposition that it is a legitimate exercise of the Community's powers for it to impose a legal requirement on all member states to ban tobacco advertising. The Commission has introduced the draft directive under article 100A of the Treaty of Rome. That article is concerned with the completion of the internal market. Doubts have been expressed on whether the draft directive is even a legal use of powers, although I am not qualified to express an opinion on that. However, I consider it an unnecessary use of the power vested in the Community under article 100A because I do not accept that uniform conditions on tobacco advertising are a necessary precondition to the completion of the internal market. As the purpose of article 100A is to give the Community the power necessary to create a proper and competitive internal market throughout the EC, I do not consider it a proper use of the powers under the article to seek to achieve a different objective. The motivation of the draft directive is not the easing of non-tariff barriers to trade, or the creation of a more competitive market in tobacco products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead, it is health oriented, because it concerns the reduction of tobacco consumption and, consequently, the reduction of harm to health caused by the consumption of tobacco.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I cannot express a view on whether the draft directive is a legal use of powers under article 100A, I believe that the motivation of the Community in the exercise of this power is nothing to do with free trade in tobacco products or with the creation of a single internal market in advertising services. It is health oriented and therefore not a proper use of the power vested in the Community under article 100A, even if, at the extreme, it is a legal use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is treading with great circumspection around the legal questions that arise. I am sure that he is aware of the memorandum from the legal adviser to the Select Committee on European Legislation, of which I am a member, which states in the most unequivocal terms that the legal adviser did not consider the proposal to be intra vires as regards article 100A, but ultra vires. Does my hon. Friend also accept that there has been a series of analogous cases in Canada and other countries, albeit under different legal systems, in which the same objectives have been sought?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. The Committee has established a convention according to which the Minister makes a statement that faithfully reflects what has been said on the Floor of the House. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) is new to the Committee—he seems to be a peripatetic visitor to our deliberations, especially when they affect his smoking habits—but he has breached that convention by intervening on the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I mean no disrespect to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), whose intervention was well informed and helpful, but the convention that has emerged in the year of this Committee's jurisprudence is that the Minister's initial statement is not interrupted because hon. Members are able to ask questions when it has finished. It would help the Committee if such rules and procedures could be established precisely and I should be grateful for your definitive guidance, Sir Michael.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, there cannot be a rule on such matters. However, equally clearly, a convention has developed. I think that that convention is good and I hope that hon. Members will adhere to it from now on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. It is not the practice of the House in every circumstance, but it may be useful and appropriate if hon. Members were to declare their interests when they speak, as some may be paid advisers to trade unions in the tobacco industry and other consultants to other bodies that have vested interests in the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me. The usual conventions apply and I am sure that all hon. Members are aware of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that I was at fault, Sir Michael, in giving way to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), but I always find an intervention from him irresistible. However, I shall comment briefly on what he said, thus removing the need for him to repeat the question later. I am aware of the memorandum to which he referred and of the legal opinion that supports the opposite argument. I am seeking to avoid expressing an opinion on that subject. Whichever side of the argument is supported by the legalities, I believe that the proposal is not a proper use of the Community's powers, because its motivation is different from what was envisaged when the original power was granted under the Single European Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have argued that the proposal has been introduced to achieve a public health objective. The Committee must therefore examine the merits of the argument that the measure is necessary to achieve the very desirable objective of reducing tobacco consumption. That at least is not in dispute among parties interested in the subject. The Government recognise and warmly embrace and endorse the desirability of further reducing tobacco consumption both in this country and throughout the Community. Tobacco is a major killer.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
It is responsibly for 80 per cent of the 41,000 deaths annually from lung cancer. We believe that it is responsible for 20 per cent of the 187,000 deaths from heart disease each year and for 80 per cent of the 31,000 deaths each year from bronchitis and other diseases that cause obstruction of the air ways. There is also a serious health hazard if tobacco is consumed by a pregnant woman. There is no argument about the desirability of substantial further reduction in tobacco consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must consider whether a ban on tobacco advertising is the most effective means of achieving a further reduction in tobacco consumption and, on that issue, the evidence is equivocal. The most compelling evidence that I have seen in my 18 months as a Minister in the Department of Health concerns the member states of the European Community. It is odd that people should consider countries outside the Community in assessing the effect of a proposal that will apply in the Community. Compared with all but two of the other member states, this country has an extremely good record in reducing tobacco consumption. It fell by 29 per cent in the United Kingdom in the 12 years from 1975 to 1987. That is the third largest reduction in tobacco consumption of any member state. The greatest reduction—41 per cent—was achieved by the Dutch, and the Irish achieved a 31 per cent reduction. It should be of at least passing interest to the Committee that we and the Dutch followed precisely the same policy on tobacco advertising. We feel that the best way to minimise the effect of tobacco advertising and to achieve the objective of reducing total tobacco consumption is by voluntary agreement with the industry. The British, Dutch and Danish Governments pursue the same policy in this respect; that is why those three Governments and the German Government are sustaining a blocking minority on the proposal in the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's view is that our voluntary approach since 1979, inherited from our predecessors, is working and is delivering the shared objective of a reduction in tobacco consumption. It is not our only step in achieving the important objective set out in the Green Paper "The Health of the Nation". We agreed, in the context of the European legislative process, a rota of some of the toughest health warnings to be printed on cigarette packets and tobacco packaging of any member state. There was a significant increase in taxation on tobacco products in the last Budget. There is little dispute about the effect of price on tobacco consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argued vehemently in the Council of Ministers, not merely as a debating point, that it is absurd for the Community to hold itself up as an institution interested in reducing tobacco consumption while it hands out subsidies for tobacco production under the common agricultural policy. The Government's position is that this proposal has been introduced under an inappropriate Community power under article 100A. When the substance of the case in support of the proposal is analysed, it is revealed to be a weak proposal which is illegitimate under article 100A.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Heal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat confused. Will the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Minister clarify his views and his reasons for not imposing a ban? The Government believe that it is worth while to impose a voluntary ban and evidence from New Zealand and Canada shows that a total ban on advertising works. A recent issue of the 	<i>British Medical Journal</i> suggests that the Danes are changing their position. Originally they opposed an advertising ban, but now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is question time; speeches will follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Heal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance, Sir Michael. Why does the Under-Secretary think it inappropriate to oppose a total ban while agreeing with a voluntary ban?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I base my answer on evidence from within the European Community. It seems odd to offer evidence from outside the Community when the proposal is a ban within the Community. We have clear evidence of the relative performance of different methods of dealing with the objective of reducing tobacco consumption in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the 12-year period 1975–87, we achieved a reduction in tobacco consumption of 29 per cent. and the Dutch, who applied a similar approach, achieved a reduction of 41 per cent Italy and Portugal imposed a ban on tobacco advertising and, over the same period, tobacco consumption rose by 8 per cent in Italy and by 7 per cent in Portugal. People cannot ignore such evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, I am somewhat sceptical about the activities of the European Commission. I have a sneaking suspicion that the Commission wishes to ban tobacco advertising from bills and posters to leave more room for itself at sporting facilities. For example, every time that someone threw a ball during the Rugby World Cup we could see a European flag among the advertisements for cigarettes. I understand that the Commission was a patron of the Rugby World Cup and in the summer paid £700,000 to secure similar rights at the World Student Games. We discovered yesterday in the draft European budget that it will pay £10 million to ensure a major presence at the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"to this end the European Community flag will be used during the presentation of medals."</p></blockquote>
That will cost between £8 million and £9 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing tobacco, not the European flag.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can respond briefly by suggesting that if the European Community is able, by a legitimate use of its powers under the treaty of Rome, to promote rugby in Germany, Portugal, Spain and Italy, that would be useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the Under-Secretary's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs. Heal), does he agree that there is a danger of being over-legalistic toward the problem? There are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
legal arguments for and against, but the common-sense view is that advertising a product that cause disease and death seems to be foolish. As we are in the European Community, surely it makes sense to adopt such a measure across the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried not to be over-legalistic. Article 100A was included in the Single European Act to achieve a more competitive market and freer movement of goods and services across the Community. The banning of advertising tobacco does not take the Community one step further toward a more competitive single European market. It is clear that, as the hon. Lady says, the motivation of the proposal is to achieve a public health gain, but it is not legitimate to use in such a way a power that was envisaged for a different purpose, even though the public health outcome were to be the result of the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be looking at advertising through the wrong end of the telescope. Does he have information on the amount of advertising that has been undertaken to promote health? In providing information about the effectiveness of a ban on advertising tobacco products, we have not been given any information about the effectiveness of promoting antismoking campaigns. Might not the countries that have seen the greatest reduction in smoking be those countries that have done most to advertise non-smoking? If so, that shows the power of advertising. Does the Minister have any information on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most important advertising campaign against smoking is the requirement of tobacco companies to print warnings on every pack of cigarettes that is sold. Companies are no longer allowed to distance themselves by attributing the statement that smoking is damaging to health to some obscure civil servant. The requirement is to state the dangers as a matter of fact—that "smoking kills" or a similar message. That slogan is required to be put, on rotation, on tobacco packaging. It is the most effective form of advertising that could possibly be undertaken. Moreover, it is undertaken not at public expense but at the expense of tobacco companies. The slogan is there and visible on every occasion that a smoker starts to smoke. That is advertising about the health consequences of smoking at the point of use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister convey my thanks to his officials for the early delivery of documents? All Departments are beginning to improve their performance on this important subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a long-standing critic of the European Commission, I must say that I support the proposals on this issue. Is it the Minister's view that article 100A(3) is not, and cannot be, an enabling power? It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety and environmental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection."</p></blockquote>
Why has the Commission—made up of fairly intelligent men and women, just one woman in fact—used for the bedrock of their case article 100A if it is, as the Minister says, so weak?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is a very easy question to answer. Article 100A gives access to qualified majority voting in the Council, which makes it easier for the Commission's proposals to be accepted. The passage to which the hon. Gentleman referred is clearly a subsidiary passage to article 100A(1), which makes it clear that the purpose of proposals under the article is the completion of the internal market. Some of the restrictions that need to be aligned to eliminate unnecessary barriers to trade within the Community are health and safety oriented. The purpose of article 100A(3) is to say that when those restrictions are aligned, they should be aligned upwards, not downwards, which I welcome. However, it is not a basis for saying that the Community has a power to introduce a proposal which, while it may or may not be desirable in terms of health, safety or environmental considerations, has nothing whatever to do with the internal market. That issue is being addressed throughout article 100A.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend the Minister help me with a slight confusion that emerges from my reading of the documents? I endorse the case presented clearly and promptly by his Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from my hon. Friend's comments to the Select Committee on European Legislation that, till now, the issuing of the directive has been blocked by Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, forming a blocking minority. However, I note from the supplementary memorandum dated 14 October 1991 that the Dutch presidency proposed a simpler version, which contained broadly the same substance. It looks as though the Dutch switched their view between the end of 1990 and the end of 1991. Did they make that switch, and if so, why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the Dutch have not changed their view. In the action that my hon. Friend mentioned, the Dutch were acting in their capacity as President of the Council of Ministers and they sought to secure agreement on a proposal. I believe that the Dutch Government either voted against the Dutch presidency proposal or said that they would not accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Heal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the fact that Health Ministers in the Länder in Germany are urging their Government to change their view and to support the ban?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer for every Health Minister in each of the German Länder. However, it does not surprise me that there are people in Germany arguing the same case as that of the hon. Lady. The German Government have consistently taken the view that the ban would not use article 100A properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we accept the ban and it becomes European law, what would happen to periodicals and magazines that were imported from outside the EEC and that certain tobacco advertisements? Would they have to be banned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point, which was discussed at a European Community
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
meeting. I believe that the presidency called on the Commission to produce a paper on what were called the side-effects of the proposal, which included the matter that my hon. Friend raised. That problem is still obscure and, if the proposal reaches the statute book, it will need to be resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is disappointing that the Minister continues to take the absurd and craven position that the Government have taken against the tobacco addiction lobby. Why is it necessary to prove that the measure is, in his words, the most effective way to reduce the number of people who smoke? Is not it enough to prove that it would be an effective way to do so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people have died of their tobacco addiction. It is clear that the tobacco industry is trying to replace those losses by aiming tobacco advertising at young people. In the Minister's one-sided and partial account, he mentioned arguments about the ban being ultra viers of intra vires. In adopting his causalistic position, he failed to mention the arguments for its being intra vires. Will he tell us what they are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sought to distance myself from legal arguments because I am not a lawyer and members of the Committee would not want to hear a layman expound his views on what the law is. However, they might occasionally be interested in what that layman thinks the law should be. My case is not based on an interpretation of the law, and whether the ban would be ultra vires or intra vires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Single European Act gave the European Community powers to achieve the completion of the internal market. I do not believe that that matter is in dispute. The motivation for the proposal has nothing to do with the internal market. It would not be legitimate to use the powers relating to the completion of the internal market to achieve something quite different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered the implications that the directive would have on the freedom of the press? He has already proposed some excellent arguments to the effect that the ban on advertising is unnecessary. Does he agree that freedom of expression is a vital ingredient in such arguments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend—he and everyone else should have the opportunity to put their arguments. The proposal would ban the advertising of a legal activity. There is a heavy burden of proof on those who support such a ban. As my hon. Friend knows, tobacco advertisements are already banned on television and radio. The legal restriction on advertising tobacco products is a rubicon that has already been crossed. It is one that we should extend only with great care for precisely the reason outlined by my hon. Friend. Whether people should be free to advertise their commercial interest when that interest is entirely legal is a substantial civil rights issue. I do not say that it is inconceivable that it could ever happen, but the burden of proof on those who argue that case is properly very heavy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister repeat what he said about the banning of such advertising on radio? Is what
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
he said correct? I thought that certain tobacco products could be advertised on the radio. Moreover, is this proposal compatible with the principle of proportionality. In terms of proportions of votes allocated to different countries, will the German nation be given added voting weight because of the reunification of the two countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just as Health Ministers are responsible for the completion of the internal market—it is not our principal responsibility—I am glad to say that the consequences for the Community of German reunification are not my direct responsibility either. I know of no proposal to change the qualified majority voting arrangements in the Community. I do not wish to go further on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for advertising on the radio, cigars and polyps—no, pipes; I wondered what a polyp was in this context—the advertising of cigars and pipe tobacco is technically legal, but does not happen in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about proportionality?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of proportionality of votes in the Council of Ministers, I am not aware of any proposal to change the arrangements for qualified majority voting. However, I hold no ministerial responsibility for working through the consequences of German unification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that my hon. Friend concedes the powers of advertising on the side of a packet and that he genuinely wants lower rates of smoking, What consideration might be given to a total ban for a while—say 10 years—to measure the combination of that with promotional advertising to reduce smoking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, my hon. Friend is modest in his suggestions. Perhaps we can go one step further. We can examine the experience of other member states in the European Community which have tried, not for 10 but for 12 years, the policy that he espouses. It is an odd coincidence that the two countries that impose, and the two that propose, a total ban on tobacco advertising happen to be the four countries in the European Community which, during that 12-year period, achieved an increase in tobacco consumption. It is hard to argue a casual link between a tobacco advertising ban and an increase in tobacco consumption, but that appears to have been the result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that there was a ban on such advertising on television. Does he agree that tobacco companies evade the ban by sponsoring sports events, many of which are televised? Therefore, many people believe that cigarette and tobacco advertising is permissible on television, simply because of the existence of those sponsored events. Does he envisage any action at European level which he could support?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not envisage action at European level because I am not sure of its relevance. It concerns the BBC much more than purely tobacco advertising. The BBC has discussed the matter with Home Office
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Ministers, but I know of no proposal at present to change the current arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am whole-heartedly in favour of my hon. Friend the Minister's comments about the burden of proof in cases when any legislative body seeks to restrict human freedom in any way. I am also persuaded by his argument that in many instances of tobacco advertising—clearly in poster campaigns—no case can possibly be made under article 100A that the free movement of goods within the Community is in question. That case is made with great lucidity by the legal adviser to the Select Committee in the papers put before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, article 100A might well arise in respect of health warning on packets of cigarettes or other tobacco products. If such products are to circulate freely in the Community and if there is to be a compulsory health warning in one part of the Community, that warning should by definition be the same everywhere. There would otherwise be a differentiated regime, which would be an obstacle to the free movement of goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, if newspapers and journals are to circulate freely in the Community, as we all hope, it will surely be impracticable both to have differentiated regimes of restrictions or regulation of tobacco advertising and maintain the principle of free movement of magazines and other printed material.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is in force in Europe a regime of harmonisation of health warnings on tobacco packaging which satisfies absolutely the terms of article 100A. It does not seek to bring precisely into line but to approximate health warnings in different member states, and gives each member state a choice of the range of warnings that go on the packaging in rotation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, we opted for some of the toughest of those alternative forms of health warnings to draw smokers' attention, while they are smoking, to the health consequences of their action. Such a regime is in force and it achieves the purpose, in the words of article 100A, of approximating the regulatory regimes in the different countries. However, there is an important non-tariff barrier to trade in the whole of Europe which cannot be eliminated by any article of any treaty, in that most European countries have different languages. None the less, the basic regime governing health warnings is aligned throughout Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of alignment of the approximation of what is allowed to be printed in newspapers goes much wider than tobacco advertising. Newspapers carry a wide range of advertisements and articles on matters where the law in one state differs from that in another. If this proposal was intended to facilitate the free circulation of printed material around the Community and to align all the regulations governing printed matter in the member states, I would find it much more difficult to argue that it was an illegitimate use of 100A. But there is no such proposal. The document addresses a tiny share of the total volume of printed material. It cannot therefore be argued that it would serve seriously to inhibit the free movement of printed matter around the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Heal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that the industry spends about £100 million a year on advertising? Can he say how much the Government spend on health education and, in particular, on anti-smoking campaigns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I told my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt), the most effective advertising drawing attention to the health hazards of smoking is not done at public expense, but at that of the tobacco companies, through the requirement that every time the products are advertised—whether on a hoarding or on the packets themselves, health hazards are mentioned. That represents an advertising spend at the time of greatest effect. That is far and away more important than the specific expenditure incurred by the Health Education Authority and other organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Commission in its wisdom decides that there should be printed on bottles of alcohol a warning of the harmful effects of alcohol if taken in excess or on a regular basis, would it not be totally inappropriate for it to use the articles on single market legislation to promote such advertising? Is not there a comparison to be drawn with tobacco? If such warnings were required, the Commission would introduce them under entirely different parts of the treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend suggested that it would not be legitimate to use article 100A to harmonise health warnings. In the case of goods traded across national frontiers, we accept the use of article 100A because that treaty forms the basis of the approximation of health warnings on tobacco products. I do not agree with my hon. Friend that it is inconceivable that article 100A has been used legitimately in the case of tobacco products. However, to justify its use, a real trade barrier should be identified. In reality, there is no exisitng trade barrier in the Community associated with warnings on alcohol products. If there is no trade barrier, there is no problem to be addressed by the use of 100A.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister considered the freedom of the individual to breathe fresh air untainted by carcinogenic particles? That is more important than the freedom of others to poison their neighbours. There is absolute proof of the deadly effect of secondary smoking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister answer the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire about the proportion of money that is spent compared with the £100 million?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tobacco industry has made fools of the Government over tobacco advertising on television. There is no health warnings when people—especially young people—watch television. Will the Minister urge the tobacco companies—or even legislate—to ensure that when tobacco adverts appear on television, a health warning is present in sound and vision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a range of public sector support for different programmes designed to discourage smoking in general and smoking by young people in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Particular. It includes a £2 million scheme directed at teenage smoking and a £300,000 programme of support for voluntary organisations seeking to reduce tobacco consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Health Education Authority spends a proportion of its budget on anti-smoking advertising. I cannot quote to the Committee the precise amount but I shall do so later. However, those sums are chicken feed compared with the sums that we require tobacco companies to spend to advertise the health hazards associated with their products. We do not encourage tobacco companies to suggest that the Government should pay that bill—we think that they should do so. They sell their products with a health hazard warning attached. We require them to advertise that health hazard every time that they advertise, and on every cigarette and tobacco packet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of that advertising dwarfs the publicly funded campaign and it is paid by those who should pay for it—those who have a commercial interest in promoting tobacco consumption. What was the hon. Gentleman's first question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked about the freedom of individuals to breathe fresh air.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that, on every issue, the questions of the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) are about proportionality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard as important the freedom to breath air unclouded by other prople's tobacco smoke. I have never smoked, and do not like smoking other people's smoke—but that aspect is not addressed by the European Community proposal to ban tobacco advertising. The way to address that problem is to reduce smoking in public places—a programme in which the Government are playing a full part—and reduce total tobacco consumption. Britain has a good record on that compared with all other European states. Only the Never-lands, which operates the same type of regime as our own, is significantly ahead of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Goodman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may point out that proportionality began life as the principle that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the individual should not have his freedom of action limited beyond the degree necessary for the public interest."</p></blockquote>
That is why I called out from a sedentary position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's initial statement refered to the dramatic and welcome decline in tobacco addiction, but it has not been spread evenly across society. There are some worrying trends in cigarette smoking, in particular among young working-class women. It is a dangerous habit, especially for young women who are pregnant. Is the Minister satisfied with the Government's campaign to dissuade vulnerable people from taking up such a pernicious habit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are always seeking new ways of drawing to the attention of any smoker, or potential smoker, the health hazards invoved. We do that in general and we specifically try to draw the hazards of
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
smoking to the attention of children. The latest tightening of the voluntary code was devised to lessen the exposure of children and young people to tobacco advertising, by reducing the number of billboards and hoardings close to schools and playgrounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We emphasise repeatedly—as I did in my opening statement—the health hazards of smoking for pregnant women, where, potentially, two lives are at risk. We need to ensure that our efforts on health promotion and health awareness are directed towards those in greatest danger. That is part of the purpose and thinking behind the health service reform programme that we undertook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to that programme, managers should spend more time and effort channelling health resources, both promotional and curative; identifying health needs; and observing the principle of proportionality to reflect real health priorities, district by district and community by community. That is an important part of the Government's approach to health planning, but it is not consistent with the Community's policy approach of a blanket ban on advertising, which is a serious civil rights issue with, at the very least, arguable practical results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I must press my hon. Friend on his reply to my earlier question. My hon. Friend conceded by implication that the present situation in respect of the circulation of newspapers, magazines and other printed material in relation to 100A is unsatisfactory. He said that he would be more sympathetic if the Commission made a proposal for harmonising the regime to remove any obstacles to the free movement of such material in the future. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that helpful reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found my hon. Friend's argument harder to follow, however, regarding the regime for compulsory health warnings on cigarette packets. He said that there had been some approximation of the regime in the Community, but no harmonisation or standardisation of health warnings. With a certain air of self-congratulation, it seemed to me, he said that the UK's mandatory health warnings are more severe than those applied elsewhere in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises some crucial questions. Is there genuine severity? If so, that implies that health warnings are designed to reduce the propensity of British consumers to smoke tobacco more so than those that appear on continental cigarette packets. Either our warnings are more severe, or they are not. If they are, by definition, any tobacco manufacturer with the slightest sense will ensure that it always packages its cigarettes elsewhere in the Community and then ships them into this country—which a manufacturer will be fully entitled to do under the single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one but a lunatic would incur the competitive incubus of producing cigarettes here, where more severe health warnings apply. However, if UK warnings are not effective, what is meant by the claim that they are more severe? Are we not fooling ourselves? Those important questions need to be addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to qualify my hon. Friend's summary of my comments about newspapers. I made
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
the point that we cannot argue for the proposal on the ground that it eases trade in relation to newspapers or printed materials. I am not responsible for the wider issue of whether the Community should make a proposal regarding newspaper advertising. I said that if such a proposal were to be made, it would fall more squarely within the provisions of article 100A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that I think that such a proposal is necessarily desirable. It would still have to pass a number of tests, including that which I suggested to my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Stevens), of being a real barrier to trade. I am not qualified to say whether the different regimes governing the regulation of printed material in the Community constitute a serious barrier to trade. I was arguing that a general provision could be justified, but that I did not see how a specific provision could be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to warnings on tobacco packages, every member state has its own regime, and the Community sought to narrow the differences between a wide range of regimes. Not every member state applies the same health warnings. The Community produced a list of 15 approved health warnings, from which we select a number that must appear, in rotation, on tobacco packages produced in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We opted for some of the tougher health warnings because we believe that the most important form of health promotion advertising is that which is targeted directly at potential smokers and paid for by the industry. I do not apologise for opting for advertising that is effective in drawing smokers' attention to the health hazards associated with smoking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) raised a point that has been put to us by the tobacco industry—that this will lead to the wholesale flight of the tobacco industry to the continent. I have a business background and understand the attraction of that argument, but I suspect that when mature consideration follows debate, the industry will find that other factors have also to be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I press the Minister to answer a question that I raised earlier, and that was reinforced by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), about the sponsorship of sporting events that are televised. Will the draft directive drive a coach and horses through the ban on television advertising?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, has the Minister had any discussion with local authorities about the draft directive? North Tyneside council is interested in the progress of the draft directive. Although it tries to operate a policy of no tobacco advertising on the hoardings that it owns, the council has difficulty in having a say about what is prominently displayed on other advertising hoardings in its area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that I recognise the issue of television advertising and that I am not aware of any proposal to amend the present arrangements governing the exposure of tobacco brand names on television. That illustrates a much wider issue associated with banning tobacco advertising. If it becomes illegal to
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
advertise a specific tobacco product, there would be a considerable degree of brand transfer: brands that are advertised would, somehow, be associated with tobacco. The BBC is concerned about the problem for its own reasons, and probably ITV is worried because it does not want to allow free advertising when manufacturers will pay for branded advertising. However, the issue would be a great deal bigger if such tactics were the only way to bring brands to the public's attention and thereby associate them with tobacco products. If anything, the problem would increase rather than decrease if there were a clear ban on tobacco advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Involvement in health policy and tobacco advertising is just as much an improper use of local authority discretion as it is of the Community's powers under article 100A.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Heal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to an earlier question, the Minister said that billboard advertising was not allowed near schools. Surely that is a tacit admission of the need for, and value of, a complete ban on tobacco advertising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not at all. It is an illustration of the principle that we have applied since the beginning of the voluntary approach to advertising restraint—that we tackle any clear problems associated with advertising by agreement with the industry and through a proper monitoring system through the Committee for Monitoring Agreements on Tobacco Advertising and Sponsorship. That is the appproach that has delivered the third-largest reduction of tobacco consumption in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend had any discussions on the Maastricht agreement, which is to be signed on Friday, and the increase in competence, implicit in that ratification by this House and other member states, in the context of public health?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is some years since the Single European Act was passed and we are still arguing about the scope of article 100A. We are therefore at an early stage in examining the scope of Community powers under the Maastricht agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Especially as regards public health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. The Community's powers and scope on public health matters are clearly extended under the treaty, but I am not aware of any specific proposals as regards tobacco advertising and the regulation of the tobacco market. The member states of the European Community have made a clear commitment to co-operate on a wider range of public health issues than formerly, but the original treaty has always required members to co-operate in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am having difficulty with what the Minister is saying. For a rational man, he is producing arguments that are patently insane. Did he really tell
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire that a ban on tobacco advertising would lead to an increase in consumption? I know that those were not his exact words, but he did say that there was not a casual link? By denying that post hoc ergo propter hoc applies, the Minister is suggesting that the tobacco industry could save £100 million and still sell more cigarettes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another argument put forward by the Minister is that a large part of that £100 million is spent by the tobacco industry in putting warnings on packets of cigarettes, yet the cost of that warning is marginal. It consists only of a strip of printing on the packets and the adverts. No new advertising or packaging is required, merely a reworking of existing designs. The cost must be only a fraction of 1 per cent. of the industry's total costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am calculating not the industry's costs in adding the warning, but the effectiveness of the advertising that we compel the industry to undertake. That can also be expressed as the cost that we would have to pay to achieve the same advertising effect. For example, leaving aside the cost of advertising on the packages, I am advised that the warning has to take up 17.5 per cent of the space available on a billboard. As a crude estimate, given that billboard advertising is paid for by the square foot, it can be said that 17.5 per cent of the cost of such advertising is devoted to advertising the health hazard rather than the brand. However, as I said, I believe that including the health message on billboard advertising is much less effective than including it on the packet, where it can be seen every time a person smokes a cigarette.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in the business not of imposing fines on companies, but of ensuring that the message is received as effectively as possible by those who need to receive it. I certainly did not suggest that a total ban would lead to an increase in consumption. My argument was that those with a commercial interest in linking tobacco products with established brands will find more sophisticated ways in which to do that if legitimate advertising is totally banned. One method will be to resort to television and reporting as opposed to advertising columns, because that will be the only available access to the media.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have selected the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs Heal). The Committee shall now proceed on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move:
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 6748/91 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memoranda submitted by the Department of Health on 14 October and 30 November 1991 relating to advertising for tobacco products; and supports the Government's view that this proposal is unnecessary for the completion of the Single Market, and that the new and enhanced voluntary agreement recently concluded between the Government and the tobacco industry is an effective way of controlling the promotion and advertising of tobacco products and should be allowed to continue.</p></blockquote>
We have explored the arguments, and I do not believe that the proposal is a legitimate use of the Community's powers under the treaty. Nor has it been

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Heal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move the following amendment, in line 4, leave out from "supports" to end and add
	<br><blockquote><p>"the European Commission's proposals for a ban on tobacco advertising.".</p></blockquote>
Last year, at least 110,000 people died in the United Kingdom from smoking-related diseases. That is one death every four minutes 45 seconds. In the time that this Committee takes to debate the issue, a further 25 people will have died because they smoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, an estimated 254,000 people were admitted to hospital with a smoking-related disease, occupying an average of 9,473 beds daily, costing the national health service approximately £437 million a year. Those patients were suffering and dying from cancers, heart disease, bronchial complaints, lowered resistance to diseases such as AIDS, leukaemia, sickle-cell anaemia and ulcers, to name but a few of the diseases brought on by smoking. That is a roll-call of individual tragedy and national loss. Smoking is by far the United Kingdom's greatest single cause of avoidable ill health and death. The situation that I have described is a sad testament to the inadequacy of this country's public health programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party is committed to a ban on tobacco advertising as part of its vigorous campaign to promote a healthy Britain. We are not alone in supporting the urgent need for a ban. The British social attitudes report in 1990 showed that 64 per cent of the public back a ban on tobacco, as do national and international organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the British Heart Foundation, the Cancer Research Campaign, the Health Education Authority, the British Medical Association, the Health Visitors Association, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives and the Trades Union Congress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A necessary function of any public health programme must be promotion of ways to reduce tobacco consumption. Smoking rates are still far too high. Recent figures show that 30 per cent of British adults are regular smokers. That figure should be reduced to 20 per cent by the year 2000. It is ludicrous that while there is no disagreement about the devastation that smoking causes, we do not legislate to prevent the promotion of that addiction. A ban on the advertising of tobacco products, whether promotional, as in sports and arts sponsorship, or by magazine or billboard advertisements is a vital step that we ust take to reduce smoking levels. That is the desire of Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Advertising appears crucial to the development of the tobacco industry. It is designed to attract new smokers, often young adults and, more worryingly, children. It is the industry's aim to keep them hooked. The industry takes advertising so seriously that it is prepared to spend an estimated £100 million a year on it. The promotion of an addictive and lethal product cannot be tolerated on moral, ethical and health grounds in a civilised society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tobacco companies argue that the promotional campaigns are designed purely to attract committed smokers to different brands, but no one seriously believes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
that argument. A recent report by Action on Smoking and Health—an updated version of "Tobacco Advertising: The Case for a Ban"—was published in December last year. It shows that the number of smokers who shift brands to those of another manufacturer is approximately 437,000 or 3.1 per cent of all smokers. To convert that small number who spend about £700 a year each on cigarettes—leaving the tobacco companies with £175 after tax per smoker—the industry spends £100 million, or £229 for every smoker who is converted, with no assurance that the converts will remain with the new brand. No cost-conscious business would ever contemplate an investment with such poor results. There must be other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An industry whose product kills 110,000 of its consumers a year must attract new ones to continue its vicious circle of death. The loss of those 110,000 consumers roughly equals a loss of £19,250,000 to the tobacco industry each year. The industry needs to replace those losses and it focuses its attention on young people.

The report of the Cancer Research Campaign, "From the Billboard to the Playground", highlights the activity of the industry in attracting children and young people and its effects on them. Although the industry denies targeting children, it is clear that its message is getting through to them. The report shows that 83 per cent of 11 to 14-year-olds could recall seeing one cigarette advert and more than half of them could remember two or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some children were able to recognise and identify at least five brands from adverts where the brand names were obscured or not shown. When asked, children identified certain images with smoking of which they approved. Therefore, they made comments like these: "It's telling you that if you smoke, you're going to be a macho he-man"; "It's glamourising cigarettes … cocktails and all that fanciness"; "You'll have a relaxed time if you smoke this cigarette"; "It must be cool to smoke … like a cowboy … relaxed … nothing gets you going, nothing bothers you."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Government survey in 1990 reported that 10 per cent of 11 to 15-year-olds are regular smokers and that a further 6 per cent are occasional smokers. A closer look at the figures shows that 25 per cent of 15-year-olds are smokers. ASH states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"before it is legal to sell them cigarettes one in five children is already a regular smoker."</p></blockquote>
A study by MORI in 1990 for the Health Education Authority shows that the four most heavily advertised brands are the four brands most often smoked by under-age smokers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Voluntary agreements do not work and are broken. When children of six years of age can identify brand names of cigarettes by the markings on toy cars and can watch sporting fixtures on television sponsored by the tobacco industry, they are conditioned from an early age to associate smoking with glamour, excitement and maturity. A voluntary ban does not deny them access to newspaper and magazine advertisements. If the Government voluntary agreement with tobacco companies bans billboard advertisements near schools or in
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
magazines targeted at children, the Government obviously recognise the need to protect children from the detrimental and persuasive effect of those adverts. Recognising that danger, it is irresponsible to permit advertising and sponsorship by the tobacco companies in other media to which under-age smokers and potential smokers have access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party fully supports the draft directive of the European Commission, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"all forms of advertising for tobacco products shall be banned in the territory of the Community."</p></blockquote>
Evidence from bans in New Zealand and Canada shows that a successfully implemented and monitored ban can reduce smoking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to search for the New Zealand research report. It would provide guidance for the Committee—not necessarily to be read now. It would be very helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Heal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. In New Zealand, prior to the ban, tobacco advertising in June 1990 had increased by 14 per cent. Following that, the prevalence of smoking among adults rose from 26.8 per cent to 27.5 per cent—the first increase in six years. The ban was introduced in December 1990 and by June 1991, prevalence had fallen to 25.1 per cent. Those figures were issued by the New Zealand Department of Health, which monitored and enforced the ban.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Canada, a ban was introduced in January 1989. The rate of decline in cigarette consumption per adult—it had already been in decline since 1982—doubled from an average of 3.6 per cent between 1983 and 1988 to 7.6 per cent in 1989 and 6.7 per cent in 1990. Those are Canadian Government statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot ignore the overwhelming evidence that shows that the promotion of tobacco through advertising and sponsorship is dangerous for young people. Furthermore, they cannot ignore the evidence from Canada and New Zealand that bans on advertising tobacco lead to real and rapid declines in consumption. It is odd that the only support for the Government's position on this serious issue comes from tobacco companies. In effect, there is a union of the Department of Health and the tobacco companies against the wisdom, experience and knowledge of virtually every medical research and professional grouping—a tragic battle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are supping with the devil on this issue. They would rather support the tobacco industry than take the advice of their Health Education Authority. Will the Minister give us an insight into the combined minds of those whose livelihood is based on selling lethal addiction and those in his Department whose responsibility it is to deal with the effects of that addiction? Indeed, the Department should be responsible for encouraging the population to avoid it. Does overwhelming medical evidence, practical evidence and public opinion count for nothing? Or will the Department of Health and its Ministers disregard overwhelming opinion as usual?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already drawn the Minister's attention to the fact that his isolated position is untenable. Lest we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
forget that 25 per cent of 15-year-olds smoke, I should like to point to other ways in which the voluntary agreement is being breached not only in spirit, but in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yorkshire ASH has recently highlighted breaches. Moreover, the practice of companies such as Rothman and Benson and Hedges is to take over top-named nightclubs for promotional evenings so as to distribute free cigarettes to teenagers. COMITAS, the Committee set up by the Government and the tobacco industry, ruled that that did not breach the voluntary code, as clubs only admitted those over the age of 18. But hon. Members who have children in their teens must know how easy it is for children under the age of 18 to gain access to such clubs. Indeed, they frequently do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their desire to appease the tobacco companies—for reasons that baffle me—the Government support them on technicalities and ignore the realities. Such promotions specifically target young people when they are relaxed and susceptible to the pressurised promotional tactics of the tobacco industry, and in an atmosphere devoid of any warning. The real possibility that under-age smokers attend these events is ignored by the Government, and the tobacco companies capitalise on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bland assurances from the Government and the industry that contradict reality are worthless. On at least one occasion a disc jockey was heard extolling the links between sex and cigarettes. That is not based on hearsay; it was admitted by the organiser on Radio 4's "Today" programme. He went on to admit that that contradicts the voluntary code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question is whether the Department of Health has acted, by implication, as an accessory to the promotion of cigarettes to young people. The function of that Department is the promotion of good public health. It is incompatible with that function to tacitly support the promotion of an addiction that kills 110,000 people annually. The Government's position, surely, is untenable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's only possible course of action is to sever their co-operative ties with cigarette promotion and to support the European draft directive. How long can Ministers continue to ignore the near unanimous evidence that demonstrates the effects of tobacco advertising and sponsorship in encouraging young people and under-age children to smoke? Will the Government continue to believe the evidence of the tobacco industry, whose only interest is to hook as many people as possible on to its addictive and lethal produce? How long will Ministers ignore the evidence from New Zealand and Canada, which demonstrates how a well-enforced and monitored advertising ban can rapidly reduce cigarette consumption?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supporting the European directive is an important and vital measure to limit tobacco consumption. Supporting the ban must be part of an active public health programme, which must include giving more advice to smokers about how to spurn the habit, making hospitals smoking-free areas, and using the national health service at every opportunity to encourage the smokers
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
in its care to give up the habit. That programme must also include the rights of people to work in a smoke-free environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to begin to believe the Government's posturings on public health, they must have a credible public health policy. A policy that permits the active encouragement of young people to smoke simply defies belief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The terms of the amendment and of the motion allow for both to be debated for the remainder of our sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to my hon. Friend the Minister's comments. He is against smoking. However, he dealt very well with the suggestion that the evidence that has been proposed by the European Commission is unnecessary and misleading. He combined an objective view with his personal view that he did not like smoking and that he did not want to inhale other people's smoke. All of that was extremely well put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view taken by the hon. Members for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs. Heal) was extremely partial. I do not take exception to the fact that she feels strongly—no doubt as strongly as the Minister—about the subject. However, the hon. Lady was not prepared to consider objective analysis, including that of the Quebec court. The report of New Zealand's Toxic Substance Board was recently considered in the Canadian courts. The hon. Lady looks a little puzzled, as does one of her colleagues. I wonder whether they have read what the judge said about the evidence of the New Zealand Toxic Substances Board. I am interested in this issue not specifically and exclusively in relation to smoking but because of the underlying principles involved, such as freedom of speech and of expression and whether we are moving towards social engineering, which I might expect from the Opposition given the arguments of the hon. Lady and of the European Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may quote from the justice's judgment on the case in Quebec. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… with respect to the TSB report, the Court"—</p></blockquote>
the Quebec court—
	<br><blockquote><p>"can only note that it contains serious methodological errors and a lack of scientific rigour which renders it for all intents and purposes devoid of any probative value. It is a report with an obvious point of view and its conclusions reflect that point of view. In this regard, the Court concludes that the TSB Report is an extrinsic document, and is of no probative value".</p></blockquote>
That is what the court said. It has no axe to grind. I do not have the faintest idea whether that judge is a smoker. He may, like my hon. Friend the Minister and other Members of Parliament, strongly oppose smoking, but at least he is prepared to make an objective assessment of what lies at the heart of the issue. It is not about a ban on smoking; that is not what we are debating today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
methodological errors and a judgment which he had to go all the way to Canada to find, but he has not explained what the judgment was about. The hon. Gentleman's case is most unconvincing. He would need to start at the beginning to explain what he is arguing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that this is a short debate on advertising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely my point, Sir Michael. Listening to the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire, one might have thought that we were discussing a ban on smoking. Almost everything that she said was directed to that. But the issue is whether it is proper for the Commission to introduce, under article 100A, a ban on advertising smoking products. The questions to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred, with which I entirely agree, show that there is no vires for this provision in article 100A. They accord with the evidence of the legal adviser to the Committee on which I sit and, indeed, with many other legal opinions. Furthermore, such a provision would not produce the desired result, as my hon. Friend the Minister said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Analysis of countries, even those within the European Community, where a ban is imposed shows that it does not have the effects claimed for it. Therefore, the argument falls on the merits of the objective analysis which is applied; not only is it unnecessary, but it does not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I criticise the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire, not for her personal crusade, as she would see it, to help to save the health of the nation by preventing people from smoking, but for her cardinal error of confusing the issues in her mind and her crusade with the issues presented in this proposal and its implications for the people of this country and of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the Canadian and New Zealand cases simply because the hon. Lady made such a song and dance about them. Had I the time, I could discuss the arguments—one of which I advanced, but there are many more—to show that the Canadian and New Zealand bans were based on extremely flimsy evidence about advertising and smoking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, in the light of events, the Government in New Zealand have already partially repealed a law, passed by their predecessors, that banned sports sponsorship by tobacco companies. The partiality—or ignorance—with which the hon. Members for Mid-Staffordshire and for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) put their case suggests that they could have done more analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A free vote is scheduled to repeal that legislation and to replace it with guidelines based on the previous voluntary code. That takes us back to the argument of my hon. Friend the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to argue whether smoking is good or bad for people—we could discuss that in another environment—but if we stick to the issue of advertising products, as you, Sir Michael, would want, the Minister's case becomes extremely well argued. I do not want to over-flatter him, but I have listened to his
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
arguments in various debates and I know that he has strong views on several issues. Unlike the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire, however, he never allows his personal judgment to cloud his objectivity in presenting his argument. That is extremely important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Joyce Quin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that we had not referred to television advertising; he may have been out of the Room when I asked questions about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that many eminent legal opinions backed the legal opinion that was given by the Clerk to the Select Committee on European Legislation. Can he give a list? I understood the Minister to say that the legal arguments were balanced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that there were no arguments on the other side. I said that many legal opinions support the Government's proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Lady the opinions later, but I do not have them in front of me now. There are a number of legal opinions and they are well known to the Department—there is no secrecy about them. It is plainly a question of analysis and interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Freedom of speech is an important principle. I am delighted that the Government are taking an important stand on this because one of my main propositions to the Committee relates to the manner in which this huge volume of European legislation swoops down upon us, which we are obliged to implement if it is agreed. Other member states see not only the value of the Government's arguments about necessity but the fundamental principles that arise, which the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire and her hon. Friends seem prepared to sweep to one side, because it is in line with their general social engineering attitudes to life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire to laugh, but why does not she apply the same arguments as she applies to the ban on advertising tobacco to a ban on advertising alcohol?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Lady will not be tempted to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely casting a fly, but no more than that, Sir Michael.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Heal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to reply to some points that the hon. Gentleman made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I referred throughout to the impact that tobacco advertising had on the consumption of cigarettes and the way in which it attracted young people to smoking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I know of no other product that has such a detrimental effect. If abused, alcohol can have a detrimental effect on health, as can food or motor cars, but I can think of no other product that can kill if one follows the manufacturers' recommendations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several examples, but unfortunately this is a much bigger question than the Committee is considering. Fundamental principles are at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
For example, the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) mentioned the right to inhale clean air. I agree with him on the principle of that freedom, but one only has to go into the street to realise that, unfortunately, it does not apply. There are also implications for the ozone layer. I know that you, Sir Michael, would not want me to explore those implications, but they are important matters of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs. Heal) mentioned the freedom to use petrol or diesel fuel in cars, but that freedom can have an impact on the ozone layer. It is possible, therefore, that the principle implicit in the proposal could be cited as a precedent in dealing with other matters, such as alcohol?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Burt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Regular members of the Committee enjoy our guests' attendance and can learn from them. However, if they are given precedence over regular members, who might not have enough time to speak as a result, they would do well to acknowledge the privilege that they have been afforded, and be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. The convention is firmly established in this Committee that regular members of the Committee are called to speak first. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) has had the Floor for some time. Although he is an honoured visitor to our proceedings, our conventions should be observed by all right hon. and hon. Members, regular and peripatetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. I must conduct proceedings according to the rules of order. I understand that conventions may develop, but I am not aware of any guidelines in that regard. Written evidence may emerge in the fullness of time to guide the Chairman of Committees, but until then, such matters are for Committee members to decide. Moreover, Chairmen do not always attend every sitting of a particular Committee, so may not necessarily be aware of all the conventions that have developed. Until written guidance is available, Chairmen will have to rely—very properly, I think—on the good sense of hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Staffford (Mr. Cash) will take what I have said into account, and will limit the duration of his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief. I understand the points that have been made, but given the Committee's composition and the interest that has been shown, it is probable that had I not had the opportunity to make my remarks, the balance would have been in favour of imposing the ban as a whole. I am entitled to make that comment as a point of reference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How dare my hon. Friend take that attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it whether or not my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt) likes it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire did not mention evidence that the reduction in cigarette con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
sumption in Canada and New Zealand resulted from tax increases. Neither were other factors—such as the switch to the hand rolling of tobacco—mentioned. Such factors do not necessarily cut across what my hon. Friend the Minister has said, but Opposition Members might have mentioned them, so that we could know more, and give our discussion an extra degree of impartiality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.8 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to follow the hon. Gentleman. I am reassured, by earlier remarks that none of us has any vested interest in the tobacco industry. It might be a good idea if we could persuade that nice man who lives in Downing street to produce a Member of Parliament charter, so that right hon. and hon. Members could wear badges announcing which bodies provide them with financial comfort and assistance. In that way, we would know when right hon. and hon. Members were speaking impartially—as we have been urged to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no interest to declare in the tobacco industry, but I have never understood why a speech of mine should be considered better because it is informed by prejudice rather than self-interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer not to the quality of the eloquence or speeches. Only 14 per cent of Labour Members have outside financial interests, as paid advisers to trade unions or as consultants or directors of other bodies, whereas 85 per cent of the available Conservative Members have paid consultancies—some of them have many. While we seek the holy grail of impartial truth and the quest for objectivity continues, it would be helpful to know whether the wallets of some hon. Members are filled by outside interests. That would enable us to judge the value of their contributions to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, we have seen how the argument for advertising tobacco has progressed. It has not changed a great deal, although it has grown more desperate and threadbare. The original ban was opposed by those with tobacco interests, who wanted to encourage the addiction, using precisely the same arguments that they are currently advancing. They were wrong then, and they are wrong now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about financing advertising. He is naive, if he believes that 17 per cent of the £100 million spent on advertising by the tobacco industry is aimed at decreasing tobacco use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I explained that 17 per cent of the billboard's advertising area must be devoted to advertising the associated health hazards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tobacco industry has cleverly managed matters so that the colourful, persuasive, attractive, seductive part of the advert is what encourages people to smoke, while the boring part at the bottom is deliberately designed as a turn-off. The warning appears in capital letters, because lower-case letters are easier to read, and is printed in black and white. The warning is deliberately meant to look like an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
appendage—a margin—and is designed not to be appealing. The point is that the industry has found a way around the restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister do something about the cheating that occurs on television? We see these great heroes—people who ride motor cycles, and racing drivers—wreathed in swaddling clothes that are covered with adverts. They are hero figures for young people—precisely those whom the tobacco industry wants to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by supporting every word said by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs. Heal). Many of us have seen relatives and friends die, hacking themselves to death, because of their addiction. There is crystal clear evidence of a causal link between tobacco and dreadful, killer diseases. It is absurd to suggest that banning tobacco advertising will not reduce the number who smoke. Of course it will, and that is what we should be engaged in doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.14 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made a brief speech on which the Committee need not spend much time. However, he reinforced the remarks of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and of the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs. Heal). The major problem with smoking is that it kills people, makes them ill, and offers no real advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People may smoke from habit, addiction, peer group pressure, or sophistication. If the same amount of tobacco is always to be sold, more tobacco smokers need to be created—probably at the rate of 2,000 a week, if they are to replace all those who die prematurely, with an extra 1,000 or 2,000 a week to replace those who give up smoking during their teenage or adult life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key tests are, how fast tobacco consumption and the numbers who take up smoking in the first place can be reduced. The hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire referred to the experience of New Zealand and Canada. As a junior Minister, I had experience of dealing with drink-driving, which does not kill as many people as smoking, but places large numbers at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For years, I faced the type of onslaught that we heard in the Committee this morning, on how to deal with a problem that kills. Everybody knew that in New South Wales between 1982 and 1985 the proportion of drivers killed who were above the legal alcohol limit fell from 40 per cent to 33 per cent That was at the time of a massive publicity campaign, a lowering of the legal limit, and enforcement on a scale 50 times as great as in this country. Everyone who knew about the New South Wales experience said that we should adopt random breath testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, during the three years in which New South Wales introduced those legislative procedures, the proportion of drivers killed in Britain who were above the legal alcohol limit dropped from 34 per cent to 27 per cent—the same percentage drop as occurred in New South Wales—but from a lower level to an even lower one with no change of law, sentencing, or enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Since 1985, the New South Wales experience has remained at 33 per cent of drivers killed being above the legal limit. There was a one-off drop, and then no change. In Britain, the figure fell from 34 per cent to 27 per cent and is now at 19 per cent—probably even lower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to take the lead shown by the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire and consider the figures. None of the paperwork from the Scrutiny Committee, European Commission, Tobacco Advisory Council, Government, British Medical Association or coronary prevention group included trend figures by age group showing consumption—the stock of tobacco being used—or the flows of people who start smoking and then stop, especially those who stop after a short time. If we want to take the issue seriously and prevent 3,000 or 4,000 people a week taking up tobacco, we must secure those figures, whether by using outside agencies or from within the medical network. We must find a way to monitor figures that are produced monthly, quarterly or every six months, so that we can raise awareness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are five stages in what I term social engineering—in which I am a great believer. First, as we have learnt from the women's movement and from CND—however right one may have been, and however wrong the other—we must make people aware of the problem. This debate will help to do that. The arguments of the coronary prevention group for a ban on advertising may be a good way of raising consciousness. There needs to be a single focal point, to compel people to start paying attention to an issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second stage is to say, "They should not promote tobacco. They should not smoke. They should not smoke near me"—the pointing business. Many people would recommend legislating at that point to make smoking a crime, or to ban it. One male in three aged 30 in this country has been convicted of a serious crime. Making an act a crime does not stop people committing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While people are pointing at others and saying that they should not indulge in that act, we need to move onto the third stage, at which people say, "I should not do it." I doubt that marketing directors of tobacco companies will accept that they should not promote their products. However, we can build on the first expression that children adopt when they learn to speak—which is, "It's not fair."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we say to young people, "Do you know that there are people earning £75,000 a year driving around in cars"—cars equivalent to the one that is apparently being leased by the Princess of Wales—"who have big fat expense accounts on the basis of finding 4,000 new people a week to smoke?", those young people will start saying, "I am not going to be exploited. I will not tolerate this unfairness, or go along with peer group expectation." The amount of young women who smoke nowadays is rather sad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Awareness of the problem needs to be increased. We need to get past the instant ban on legislation, with people saying, "I shouldn't smoke." We then reach the stage of saying, "I intend not to do it." Finally, there is the stage of looking in the mirror and saying, "I don't

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
smoke—I'm not that sort of person." The final stage is saying, "Whatever my socio-economic background, I will not be conned into acquiring a habit which will do me no good at all."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statistics on the amount of money spent on promoting tobacco are very useful, and people should know about them. My guess is that once we get these sort of issues out into the open, we shall find that the Minister's declared objective of reducing smoking from 30 per cent to 21 per cent of the population by the year 2000 will be achieved very quickly—long before the next eight years have elapsed.

About 20 years ago, the French were worried about perinatal mortality. They set out to produce a seven-year programme to reduce its incidence by about one third. The programme achieved its target instantly because it addressed the specific issue. The French did not go in for a ban.

One good reason for cutting back on tobacco smoking is that if the father of a conception is a non-smoker, the chance of the baby suffering severe congenital malformation is only about—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a short debate, and that issue is very wide of the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One reason I did not participate in the questioning of my hon. Friend the Minister was that I have serious points to put across now. This is our second debate on tobacco advertising. I accept the purpose of the proposed ban, and I am trying to argue why the Government's motion is better than the Opposition's amendment. However, I do not accept any of the rubbish put forward by tobacco companies over the 16 or 17 years that I have been a Member of Parliament. They stopped taking me out to lunch 15 years ago, after I refused to accept that tobacco promotion was only about getting people to switch from one brand to another—clearly an exaggerated line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a male non-smoker is the father, the chance of a severe congenital malformation is 0.8 per cent. The comparable figure for a smoking father is 2 per cent. That means that there is a two and a half times greater chance of producing a handicapped child if the parent is a smoker.

I am indebted to Peggy and Arthur Wynn for their research on preconceptual care. Arthur Wynn switched fromn being director of safety for British Coal—or the National Coal Board, as it was then—and used the same scientific techniques that he had developed there in his new research.

We need facts and figures. I recommend that the EC stops mass random testing—one of the ideas for road safety—and blanket bans. It would be better to set targets in each member state to achieve the lowest level possible as quickly as possible. Having league tables—so that Britain can say that it is third, first, or 12th in Europe for its proportion of 15-year-old smokers—would be a better way of proceeding. That is a far better direct aim than just placing a ban on tobacco.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One other issue—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is it directly relevant to tobacco advertising? We are embarking on a general
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
debate that goes far wider than this short debate on tobacco advertising warrants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring directly to advertising. I shall not mention the time that I did not take up in our first hour, though it was interesting to hear questions and comments that were as relevant as mine will be now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we get into the habit of opting for a simple ban and for simple legislation, without focusing on the results that we want to achieve, we shall end up destroying much of the free advertising—paid for, but free in the sense of outside legislative control. Alcohol has been mentioned by others. There is a danger of criminalising or banning the promotion of other products, which would be undesirable. It is desirable to have severe restrictions on the promotion of tobacco, and to have creeping constraints on tobacco companies' ability to promote their products. They do some things that are quite unwarranted and unjustifiable. I hope that the way in which I vote later does not suggest that I think that there should be no limits; there should be more limits and they should be tighter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one must deal with the matter by legislation, I suggest that cigarettes should be sold only in black packets that state the brand in dark purple letters, and only one typeface should be used. That would get away from the influences of colour and glamour in advertising, and one would not have a product that one could promote. People who had to smoke could buy their product as a result of whatever minimal advertising would still be allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin with a question about the legal implications of the ban. What would happen if one of the three blocking countries detached itself and joined the majority? Presumably the ban would be carried at the next council meeting. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) mentioned the annex that was produced by the legal adviser to the Select Committee on European Legislation, who wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So a proposal which sets out as a harmonisation measure ends up as a prohibition measure."</p></blockquote>
If the ban were passed, could either of the remaining blocking countries challenge the decision of the council meeting by appealing to the European Court of Justice? Post-Maastricht, we are turbulent waters—given your constituency, Sir Michael, I am sure that you will forgive my using a nautical metaphor. Perhaps the matter is not now as simple as when the legal adviser, with his customary brilliance, put the annex together. I readily accept what he said. I also accept the strength of the Minister's case when it is considered in the framework of European Community law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right to argue that the Commission's case was weakened by being based on article 100A. However, in these post-Maastricht days, the Commission might be able to withdraw the proposal and include it in another article of the amended treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see a theoretical bar to the Commission withdrawing the proposal under article
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
100A and offering it on an alternative treaty base. However, even in the post-Maastricht context, no obvious alternative springs to mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if one of the three blocking countries peeled off and whether it be open to either of the remaining member states—or anyone else with 	<i>locus standi</i> in the European Court—to challenge the legality of the decision. The answer, of course, is yes. I deliberately did not offer an opinion about what the European Court's decision would be because I am not qualified to do so. However, anyone with 	<i>locus standi</i> has the opportunity to appeal to the European Court in order to challenge the treaty basis on which the Commission is proceeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. He mentioned 	<i>locus standi vis-à-vis</i> the European Court of Justice. Who can take a case to the European Court of Justice? I do not think that industries can do so, but member states and/or the European Commission may be able to do so. I am not sure that any other interested party can do so. I do not want to get bogged down in legal matters. However, they are important because of the possibility, as the Minister so elegantly described it, of one of the blocking countries peeling off and joining the majority. That could give rise to legal difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot remember whether the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) is still addicted to this drug.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, he is not and never has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that. Unfortunately, I began to smoke at the age of 12—behaviour that I deeply regret. More recently, I underwent abdominal surgery at Glasgow Royal infirmary. Most of the patients in the ward were terminal cases, as defined by the doctors. Most faced premature death through emphysema and related diseases. I spoke to the man in the bed next to me. Incidentally, the surgeon said that I was not to have any privileges. In his words—he was a typical west of Scotland surgeon—he was putting me among the punters so that when I next spoke on the national health service in that dreadful place down in London, called Westminster, I could do so as a consumer. My constituent died two weeks later. He had said to me, in a very late night conversation, how bitterly he regretted taking up this addiction because it was "doing" for him. He knew that he was on the very edge of his existence as a man, a father, a brother. He expressed that deep regret, but, for him, it was too late. Incidentally, I have made a full recovery, so there will be no by-election in Greenock and Port Glasgow—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Given my majority, the Labour party would win by a comfortable majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister stands by the voluntary code on the advertising of such products, he and his officials must answer the anxieties about the dangers inherent in this addiction both for addicts—smokers, and I speak as an ex-smoker—and non-smokers. If the latter work alongside the former, whether in the public services or in private organisations, they have a right to be protected against the dangers of this pernicious addiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
The Government do not do enough through advertising to protect the interests of those who may embark on smoking and those who must suffer the problem simply because they work alongside people who smoke. Perhaps I may cite the recent example of an ex-employee of the Greater Glasgow health board. I know that the Minister has no responnsibility for this matter; it rests rightly and properly with the Scottish Office and, I hope, in due course with the Scottish Parliament, but I shall not pursue that line of argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall see—when the Tory party is dispatched from Scotland at the next election. That former employee of the Greater Glasgow health board had, in my view, the effrontery to take to an industrial tribunal a case involving her voluntary resignation from her employment. She resigned because of a no-smoking ban imposed, rightly, by the Greater Glasgow health board—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate is about advertising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, indeed. I beg your pardon, Sir Michael.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That person had ignored all the rules and the advertising campaign generated by the Greater Glasgow health board. Following her freedom of choice, she took her case to the industrial tribunal, which rightly rejected it. The tribunal said that the health board had a right and a duty to protect the interests of all its employees. I was pleased that she lost the case. There was no question of constructive dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that I was pleased that, as a result of advertising campaigns and other measures, there had been a dramatic reduction in cigarette smoking throughout the United Kingdom but in my part of Scotland there is evidence of young people taking up the habit. Smoking is particularly prevalent among young working-class women. Despite the stark warning on every packet of cigarettes, the state—the industry and the Government—must do much more through a comprehensive campaign to dissuade prople, particularly youngsters, from smoking.

The European Commission has made a mistake in introducing the draft directive on the basis of article 100A, notwithstanding what I said earlier about article 100A(3). I regret that mistake. I hope that the Minister has his copy of the treaty of Rome. Post-Maastricht, I hope that the Commission will find another means by which it can put the proposal before the Council of Ministers. Failing that, despite the problem that a majority might find with the European Court of Justice, I hope that one of the three blocking countries will detach itself and will join the majority so that the measure can be imposed throughout the European Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.38 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate, as we find ourselves impaled on an awkward hook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is general agreement on the dangers of smoking. We now take almost for granted statistics such as those that the Minister quoted at the beginning of our debate showing the contribution made by the inhalation of tobacco to heart disease, lung cancer and to chest diseases such as bronchitis. The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) is a personal witness to that: his speech was particularly moving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for a reduction in advertising is already made. We recognise that, even with freedom of speech, it is a legitimate restriction to ban tobacco advertising on television. Is the concept of freedom of speech divisible? Is my freedom of speech more or less affected if it is chopped off in bits? The rubicon is crossed when we decide that when something is sufficiently bad we take action. If the decision is taken to restrict or to ban advertising on television because of the power of television, it is difficult to make a case for allowing advertising anywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about the power of advertising in other countries. I am unconvinced, and will remain so until more research has been done, about the statistics from other countries. There must be a correlation between restrictions on tobacco advertising and the pressure from positive advertising to get people to stop smoking. I suspect that we have done well in this country because we take that message seriously. It has been promoted both by the Government and by local health authorities, but the statistics clearly show that there is a great deal more to do. However, I do not accept that in countries where smoking has for some reason increased despite a ban on advertising, there is a causal connection, per se, between the two phenomena. There is much more to it than that, and the Department of Health must come up with a better explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Advertising on the package may be effective, but by then it is too late. Having bought a packet of cigarettes off a shelf, by the time that I read the warning, I am already committed, and might just as well smoke what I have bought. Does the warning stop me buying another packet? I do not know, but I think that other forms of advertising are far more effective. No smoker today can be unaware that the warning will be on every packet of cigarettes. I hope that it is just one of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
number of effective measures, but I am not sure that the Department of Health's conclusions about advertising can be justified until more work has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department is to some extent hoist by its own petard. It knows the power of positive advertising because it employs it. It recognises the dangers of advertising because it seeks to restrict it. Yet my hon. Friend the Minister is obliged to come to the Committee and say no to this proposal, which would extend the ban on advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite my support for the lobby against tobacco advertising, I have to say that my hon. Friend the Minister is correct. It makes me spit to admit it, but my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) has got it right. Opposition Members are not entitled to say that because the ends justify the means, we should gloss over the applicability of this proposal. My hon. Friends the Members for Stafford and for Stockport (Mr. Favell) are well known for their scepticism about Europe. I am not, but neither am I prepared to support a European Community that tries to get what it wants, positive as it may be, in completely the wrong way, by using a provision in a manner that was never intended. That is not the way to proceed.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Shut up. I am making my case. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford has made his already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Along with many hon. Members. I strongly support the case for restrictions on tobacco advertising, but we must make it properly and not abuse the articles of the Community. That is my sole reservation about the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs. Heal). It really will not do to say, "We all know what we want, and this is a convenient way to do it. Come on, let's rally together and get this through." If we want to implement a proposal such as this in this country, we must find our own way to do so. If we want to implement it through the Community, the Community's legal provisions must be adjusted to make it applicable in all member states. It is not right to deal in oranges and pears, because such equations are impossible. The importance, principles and probity of the Community would be undermined if the legal warnings were ignored and a measure whose purpose was good were pushed through in the wrong manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has given way with his habitual courtesy. If the measure is a convenient way to help to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by this form of addiction, should not we support it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The concept of reducing tobacco advertising should of course be supported. We must continue to exert pressure on the Government to continue their work to reduce it further. However, the treaty cannot be manipulated to make it do what we want if it does not do so. We want many things to be done, but, as legislators, our duty is not to say, "Oh, it doesn't matter that the provision does not allow us to do that because we all know what we want to achieve." That would be wrong. If the terms of the treaty do not allow us to do what we want to, let us amend the treaty; if it is a matter of national sovereignty, let us tackle tobacco advertising through provisions in this country.

My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) made an interesting and powerful case. There is a danger in banning what we do not like; other issues should be taken into account. Like my hon. Friend, I am sometimes prepared for the interests of the community to override individual freedom. The extent to which we accept that accounts for the difference between the two sides of the Committee, and between individual Members.

My position in relation to health and tobacco is known: I have signed motions on the issue.

I listened with care to the speech of the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt). I agree with some of his arguments, but he oversimplifies the legal views of the issue and believes that there is only one way to interpret the article in the treaty, and that that is an inappropriate base for the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier that legal opinion was divided. Having considered article 100A and the objective set out in article 8A, which is related to it, I believe that we are talking not just about the free movement of goods but about the operation and regulation of that
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
internal market. I do not, therefore, believe that a ban on advertising necessarily conflicts with the objectives of that article. I accept that it can be argued either way, but it is not as clear cut as the hon. Member for Bury, North suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may know that there are those in the European Commission who concede that this is an inappropriate use of article 100A. They have said that they are not unduly concerned about that because they want to push the public health argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If officials of the Commission have adopted that approach, I do not agree with it. However, I formed the impression that many believe that there is a satisfactory legal base. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) said that the way would be open to challenge the proposal subsequently via legal procedures if it were felt to be unsatisfactory. We approve of the Commission's proposals on the understanding that if there is a dispute about the legality, it can be resolved in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are differences in view among Conservative Members and I welcome some of the comments made by the hon. Members for Bury, North and Eltham. I hope that their feelings will allow them to support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have boxed themselves into an illogical corner on this issue. They say that they want people to stop smoking, but they do not want tobacco advertising to stop. That is a foolish and illogical approach. The Under-Secretary did not get to grips with the problems of advertising on television via the back door through sponsorship and I was disappointed by his dismissal of the involvement of local authorities by saying that it has nothing to do with them and almost implying that they should not be worried about advertising on boards in their areas. That is a narrow-minded response to my question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, I hope that the Committee will support the amendment so that we can progress toward a ban on advertising tobacco products throughout the European Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.51 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Today's useful debate has revealed some glaring anomalies. Like the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), I thought that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said that he did not think that advertising bans were effective when he cited the cases of New Zealand and of the four Community countries whose cigarette consumption increased while a ban had been imposed. My hon. Friend later made it clear that that was not his position and that he believed that certain measures were effective, such as warnings on packets. However, he felt that bans extending from the broadcasting medium to the printed medium and posters would not be effective because other brands would be marketed that were associated with tobacco. That argument actually favours the total ban that the Commission and the Dutch presidency propose in the document. Brand switching is dealt with distinctly in articles 1 and 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
I remain unconvinced about warnings on packets. If they are effective in reducing the propensity to smoke, if severe warnings are more effective than other warnings and if Britain has the severest warnings within the range of permitted warnings in the Community—which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary outlined—our warnings clearly must affect cigarette consumption in this country. That will be a significant factor in influencing tobacco companies to consider switching their investment and industrial capacity—for packing cigarettes, if not for manufacturing them—to the continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have a business background and agree with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary that many other factors will be involved in such a decision, but if the alleged severity of warnings on packets is effective, that will be one of those factors. We could end up with the ridiculous outcome of losing business because business is transferred to other parts of the single market, which would be completely crazy, while not actually reducing the cigarette consumption or the propensity to consume because cigarette packets with less severe warnings come in from elsewhere in the Community. We must deal with that major issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another glaring lacuna that emerges from my reading of the papers and from this morning's debate involves the arguments put forward by the industry. I am amazed that the Tobacco Advisory Council should have gone to such trouble to produce arguments against a ban on tobacco advertising. If, as it alleges, bans are not effective in reducing consumption, I should advocate a ban as a priority were I on the board of one of its member companies, because it would not have a negative impact on the entire market, but it would mean that the business would not have to spend money on advertising to maintain its market share. That would be the best of all worlds for the industry. It would result in an immediate increase in the bottom line of a company. A great deal of the advertising in the tobacco sector is designed to defend a specific market share. Competitors introduce new lines, which they will advertise when they launch the new products and other companies must then undertake a certain amount of defensive advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were an effective ban on tobacco marketing and advertising, market shares would be frozen. Having removed the advertising spend completely, the industry could have a wonderful franchise for the rest of the time to continue to sell Marlboro, Players or other established brands. There is a remarkable anomaly in the industry's position. We must bear in mind the extraordinary 	<i>logical lacunae</i> in all the arguments about the issue. On the basis of such theoretical confusion, I conclude that we cannot achieve a definitive practical solution to the problem. It seems that the issue will run and run. I agree whole-heartedly with the principle annunciated by the Minister: when in doubt as legislators, we should not legislate. I am happy to support the Government's motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The arguments that the Committee must assess fall into two simple categories. My hon.

I am not arguing whether the proposal can in a court of law be justified under that article of the treaty. I believe that, even if it were legal, it is not a proper use of that power. Clearly, that was not the purpose for which the Community was given such power under article 100A. The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow asked who had the locus to challenge the Council's decision if it were adopted. I shall not start to interpret the treaty of Rome, but the hon. Gentleman will find the answer, set out with the usual clarity, in article 173 of the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question that the Committee must consider is whether the end justifies the means. That is not a proposition that we can or should adopt. We should not accept a steer from Brussels on the basis that we like the motivation, even though we accept, as the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow seemed to do, that it has, at the least, a treaty base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must then query whether the proposal, on its merits, is justified. The arguments about that were perhaps best encapsulated by the simple assertion of the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) that it must work. However, that assertion was not followed by a substantive argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have two minutes left in which to encapsulate the issues that the Committee must consider. My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) stressed that, if we are to assess the merits of an advertising ban as a national Government issue, never mind what the Community may tell us to do, we must consider the effectiveness of that proposal as a means of achieving the avowed and accepted objective of reducing tobacco consumption. We must rely not on assertions but on evidence. He quoted parallel evidence from a different case involving the road safety campaign, with which he was closely associated. He illustrated that the heavy-handed legislative blunder-bus is not always the best way to achieve the objectives that we set ourselves.

The Government's objective is to reduce tobacco consumption. That was outlined recently in the Green Paper entitled "The Health of the Nation". Our record in delivering that result recently stands comparison with any country elsewhere in Europe. We have made it clear that we shall in future take the necessary steps
