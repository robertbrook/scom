	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain the policy background to the report, comment on its conclusions and explain the key issues for the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sugar regime is not time limited, nor are the 100 or so Council and Commission regulations that derive from it. Quotas are set for five years and it is usual for the regime to be reviewed at the end of each five-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1990 the existing regime was rolled forward for a further two years to June 1993 so that the outcome of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which was expected imminently, could be taken into account. A full review of the regime is due to be concluded under the United Kingdom presidency later this year and implemented from 1 July next year. We do not yet have any Commission proposals. The review will deal with beet sugar, and cane sugar, for which arrangements must be changed following expiry of the Portuguese accession period on 31 December. It is worth emphasising that the entitlement to import 1·3 million tonnes of sugar from the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries is not part of the renegotiations. That is consolidated in European legislation and does not have to be the subject of new negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sugar regime was established in 1968 and was directed at the interests of EC beet growers, although it covered also sugar growing in French overseas terrritories. Cane sugar from the French overseas teritories and overseas departments is consolidated within the EC quota and is treated as EC sugar. The quota system enabled high guaranteed prices to be offered to growers while limiting the amount of sugar that would benefit from it. Market prices to consumers rose to or above the high support price level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
Countries receive an A quota, which broadly represents their consumption and a B quota, which covers the remainder of their production. The cost of exporting quantities of sugar in excess of EC requirements is met by a levy on growers and processors, which is shared in the ratio of 60 to 40 of 2 per cent. on A quota sugar and up to 39·5 per cent. on B quota sugar. The national quotas have increased in successive reviews so that they now generate a considerable export surplus. Growers may grow sugar for export, which is C sugar. That does not fall within the quota and it is without a price guarantee. Price guarantees are significant enough on A and B sugar to enable C sugar to be grown profitably on their back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole, quotas have encouraged over-production, especially in the most efficient areas of France and Germany, and they have tended to maintain production where it would not otherwise be profitable. That applies notably in Italy. The Court of Auditors notes that the Community is approximately 150 per cent. self sufficient in sugar, so it is clear that the quota is too large. Reform of the common agricultural policy and GATT will generate pressure for cuts to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic institutional price in the sector is for white sugar—the processed product—and not for the agricultural product, as in other regimes. All other prices are derived from the intervention price for white sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have argued for many years that the institutional price for sugar is too high. We have supported the Commission's attempts to reduce it, which largely have been unsuccessful because of resistance to cutting the price of sugar. There is no stabiliser other than the quota, and support prices have been cut once only—by 2 per cent.—whereas in most of the rest of the arable sector prices have fallen by approximately 20 per cent. In comparative terms, sugar has been favoured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument against that is that the cost is budgetarily neutral. It is true that the levy system keeps the bulk of the cost out of the budget as such, but there is a charge upon consumers by a different mechanism. The European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund—FEOGA, the Community budget—pays only for exporting the tonnage that is equivalent to ACP imports and part of the subsidy on sugar that is devoted to the chemical industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the United Kingdom entered the Community in 1973, we brought out a commitment to the old Commonwealth sugar-exporting countries and agreed the sugar protocol. It is without a time limit and it provides for the exporting countries to send 1·3 million tonnes of sugar to the Community at prices guaranteed within the range of Community prices, which, practically, means raw sugar intervention price. It has been important for those countries and for the United Kingdom as it has enabled us to maintain a port refinery industry that supplies half our needs. Eighty per cent. of this sugar comes to the United Kingdom for refining, and it provides significant employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the sugar matches EEC prices: the Council of Ministers has been unanimous about this. If prices diverge, the Community cane refineries in France and Portugal, and in the United Kingdom—Tate and Lyle—will find their processing margins squeezed, and the refining of cane sugar could cease to be viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review must tackle events in Portugal. At present, Portugal imports some of its sugar from four African countries; the rest is imported at the world price under a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
preferential regime. We should like the security of those supplies, and supplies to the United Kingdom, to be assured more effectively. When some ACP countries failed to deliver their full supplies in the past, the United Kingdom felt the pinch. We did not have the required amounts for our refining capacity, which resulted in under-utilisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is alone in having equally important beet and cane sectors, and we have tried to maintain a balance between them. Although the Community support system favours beet interests, the Council recognises the need to redress the balance between beet and cane-refining margins; adjustment aids have been provided for the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The GATT disciplines—we hope that we are in the final stages of an agreement—will apply to all sectors, including sugar. Agriculture Ministers spent six hours around the lunch table on Monday with trade Ministers trying to thrash out the issues, and the Community has put its proposals on the table. We shall be part of the negotiations. The Dunkel text had problems that were common to sugar and other sectors because of an imbalance between numbers, but we hope that this can be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sugar is not part of the CAP reform proposals, but the Commission will have to introduce proposals for review. These are likely to be part of the United Kingdom's task during its presidency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall summarise briefly the report of the Court of Auditors. It states that quotas are too large and that they lead to an unacceptably high surplus to be exported. We agree. It says that prices are too high, which leads to distortion of competition with competing sweeteners and an unnecessarily high cost to consumers. We agree. The report states also that national aids ought to be removed. We agree. It says that the regime is completely insulated from world or EC market pressures, which must also be true. It states that too much non-quota C sugar is produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are thoroughly sympathetic to the comments of the Court of Auditors on the beet sector, but we do not agree with its remarks about the cane sector, where it has the wrong end of the stick. We simply do not accept the cop out that cane sugar should be removed from the regime and that we should pay a redundancy benefit to the ACP countries to put that sugar on the world market instead of sending it to the European market. That is an entitlement: it is part of the trading benefits that those countries receive, and it makes no sense to transfer it to the budget. We have fought that proposal consistently—I remember fighting it years ago in the European Parliament. Most people wanted to get rid of the problem by switching it to a different part of the budget and categorising it as something else. That does not make the slightest sense. We are hostile to that part of the report. It is unhelpful. It is not in the interests of the growers and suppliers. Nor is it in the interests of refiners in the United Kingdom and other countries. We dissent markedly from that part of the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Committee for a long summing up. Given the complexity of the regime, I hope the Committee found it helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to questions. It would be helpful if hon. Members asked a single question. I shall go round the Committee Room until all questions have been asked or until we reach 11.30 am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give us the cost per person, in this country, of the present regime? I understand that we are the highest consumers of sugar and that the figure is 40 kilos per person per year. What is the artificial cost to the consumer in comparison with the world price?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honest response is that I cannot give a meaningful answer. We would need to argue at length what constitutes the world price. It must be of common accord that prices paid by the consumer are higher than they would need be if we did not have a regime that was anchored in such excessively high quotas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is well aware of his responsibilities towards British agriculture, but does he recognise that sugar beet production is potentialy one of the most profitable crops for British farmers? In the present circumstances, in which diversification is important in trying to improve the income of British farmers, does my hon. Friend feel that we should be fighting harder for a higher quota for sugar beet in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what my hon. Friend said about the importance of sugar beet as a cash crop for the British farmer. Sugar beet and potatoes have traditionally been profitable crops for British agriculture, but it is not realistic to argue for a higher quota. We shall not be given one. I am willing to fight many battles but that is not one that is worth while. We want to ensure, however, that if we get a reduction in quota the United Kingdom will do better proportionately than other countries. We ended up with a quota that was relatively small in relation to other countries and, historically, that was partly because of our cane sugar imports. Some countries have seen an enormous expansion of C sugar on the back of the high prices paid for other sugars. The price of sugar is marooned above other arable crops and the thrust of the report should be to tackle pricing. It should tackle also the relative attractiveness of C sugar, which is being exported substantially into the world market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In how many years in the past 10 has the effect on the budget been a neutral one? Where it has not been neutral, what has been the cost to the Community? What is the overall intention in relation to ACP quotas? Will they be extended, or maintained, at the existing level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ACP quotas are for 1·3 million tonnes, and they will remain at that figure. Some ACP countries also export to the United States under preferential terms although they are slightly less preferential than the Community price. Some have significantly under-delivered their quota but, under the Community system, other ACP countries are allowed to pick up the deficit, from which they benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were successfully to negotiate increased access of cane to Portuguese refineries, the ACP countries would gain further stability. There is not the slightest chance that the Community will want to go beyond 1·3 million tonnes, although some flexibility is built into the system. Also, some ACP countries are significant importers of sugar
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
from the world market, which they use to supply their own needs. Their domestic production is devoted, to some extent, to export markets, to the Community and to the United States at preferential prices, and they import sugar from the world market to supply at least an element of their domestic needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The budget is never neutral—there is never a year in which there is no budgetary expenditure on sugar. The amount exported, in relation to the 1·3 million tonnes of the ACP, falls as a charge on the budget. That is budegetarily neutral in that there is a levy on a high price that finances the exportation of C sugar to the world market and certain aids to the sugar industry. As I do not have the figures with me, I should be happy to write to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister say more about the Government's policy aims in the forthcoming review of the CAP? They are set out rather baldly in the report. I wonder how the various aims can be reconciled. How can we maintain the viability of the cane and beet sectors in the United Kingdom and make the regime more open to market forces and more beneficial to consumers? The Government seem to want to have it all ways. I hope that my hon. Friend will expand on the answer that he gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) about how the Government will achieve those objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key to reconciliation lies with the levels of C sugar that are exported and from which country that is done. For example, France has an A quota of a couple of teaspoonfuls of sugar under 3 million tonnes and a B quota of 806,000 tonnes. The volume of C sugar that it has put on to the world market has moved around the 1 million tonnes mark for the past four or five years—which is as far as my figures go. Germany has, in effect, an A quota of 2 million tonnes and a B quota of 600,000 tonnes. Its exports of C sugar were 386,000 tonnes for 1988–89 and 585,000 tonnes for 1989–90. It has not exported to the world market in the past two years. Actually, that is not quite true—the united Germany has made significant exports and the figures have changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What can we do? I shall try to be clear. The Commission has to make a proposal, and what we do has to be based on that. We could do several things. First, the quota could be cut, on the ground that it is large. Secondly, atttractiveness could be reduced by reducing the price. Thirdly, there is a very specific mechanism which seems to me not to be justified—if C sugar is not exported it can he carried over in storage and used as part of the A quota for the following year. That would be paid for, and I can see no earthly justification for being paid to carry over that sugar. That is where an economy could quite clearly be made in budgetary terms. Various refinements could be introduced such as the so-called derived prices, by which one can allegedly gain a slightly higher price in the United Kingdom on the grounds that it is a deficit area and that account must be taken of transportation costs. However, that does not seem to play any useful purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we link a quota cut with a reduction in price and the removal of what I regard as extraneous financing—such as restorage—the consumer will end up paying a lower price. The cost of sugar on the world market is being reduced as the amount of sugar on that market is reduced, and the proposals will assist with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
We should remember that some poor countries are importers of sugar—Kenya, for example, imports very large amounts of it. So there are some beneficiaries of the system as sugar moves cheaply around the world market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I have an unusual interest to declare, stemming from the fact that my constituency contains a refinery that processes over 1 million tonnes of ACP sugar per year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to give notice that I have about a dozen questions that, if time permits, I should like to put to the Minister. I want to ask him a procedural question for now. I assume that his statement parallels the explanatory memorandum, which he deposited in the Vote Office some time ago and which is referred to in the report of the Select Committee on European Legislation. If so, will he confirm that? I should also like to know—either from the Minister or from you, Mr. Hogg—why copies of the explanatory memorandum are not available in the Room. It was not available in the bundle in the Vote Office either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks were intended to be complementary to the explanatory memorandum. They were also somewhat more up to date as events have moved forward. I apologise if all members of the Committee do not have a copy of the memorandum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I have found the explanatory memorandum in the report, which is conveniently held together with black tape. Instead of the memorandum being at the beginning, as one would expect, it is at the end. I withdraw my comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to confirm that the United Kingdom has a quota that equates to about 50 per cent. of its domestic consumption of sugar because of our traditional links with ACP countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to what are magnificently called "double ecu conversion rates" in the proposals. Will he tell us more about that? We are dealing with a marvellous sum of money which means nothing to me—44 mio ecu, which has risen apparently to 100 mio ecu. What is the effect of the double EEC conversion rate, which is the agricultural ecu rate? Will he make a wild stab at translating this terminology into something that I could think of in terms of money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I took the precaution of getting a note on this topic for the hon. Lady, but I cannot guarantee that I understand it all completely. We shall have to pool our luck on this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem arises from the difference between exchange rate parity and the green rates. Each month, expenditure incurred in the national currency in the member state is charged against the Community budgets in ecu. For this charging, a conversion rate is used which reflects the current market value of whatever currency is being used. By agreement, payments made in national currency by the dispersing agencies during the month are charged to the budget in ecu according to the rate of conversion of national currency into ecu that is in force on the 20th of that month. The rates for converting national currencies into ecu that are used for charging to the budget are not the same as the rates for converting ecu into national currencies that are used for the application of agricultural regulations: this does lead to a difference between the amount of expenditure in ecu that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
calculated according to the regulations and the amount in ecu that is charged to the budget. The difference is known as the dual rate effect. I hope that the hon. Lady is enlightened by that explanation. I shall seek to have comprehensible figures by the time that I rise to speak again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to you, Mr. Hogg, and to other hon. Members for not understanding the Committee's mysterious procedures. Secondly, I declare an interest as I am a consultant for British Sugar plc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can my hon. Friend the Minister tell the Committee a little more about the amazing agreement that was reached on Monday? This morning, I read in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> that yesterday's meeting of agriculture Ministers broke up in considerable disorder; Mr. MacSharry was in tears and the Commission was wringing its hands in desperation at the intransigence of the agriculture Ministers. Apparently on Monday, at a short meeting, they reached an important agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister will probably agree that the Dunkel proposals are disastrous for both the dairy and the sugar sectors of British agriculture, especially the manufacturing sectors. Therefore, what he said is extremely important. I wonder whether a document has been placed in the Library or whether statements have been about the detailed agreements reached at that meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to try to clarify the matter for my hon. Friend. The Dunkel proposals were based on a reduction in support of approximately 20 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Overall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Overall, expressed as an aggregate unit. The proposal was for a reduction in tariffs or import protection—various forms of protection were to be expressed as a tariff, and that tariff was to be cut—of some 36 per cent. and for a reduction in export—and there is still an argument about the volume or value of exports—of 24 or 36 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a problem with the Dunkel proposal; it was rather like sitting on a three-legged stool whose three legs were not of equal length. If support is cut by only 20 per cent. but there is a commitment to reduce exports by, say, 36 per cent., the cut will not deliver the required restraint. That would give rise to an imbalance. Equally, if supports were cut by 20 per cent. and import protection were reduced by one third—say 36 per cent.—it is possible that, at some point in the process of implementing those staged cuts, import prices would dip below the institutional prices in the Community. Therefore, imports would come in cheaper than the Community product and the Community product would tend to become eligible for complete support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem was not merely that some people do not like the Dunkel proposal in any event. The main problem was that we felt that, technically, it could not achieve what was intended. The argument and discussions among Ministers concerned the extent to which the Community could put forward amendments to achieve a more coherent and balanced proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministers did not agree on how to proceed. My hon. Friend can imagine that, with Ministers for agriculture and for trade sitting around the same table,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
everybody rehearsed arguments that were not entirely new to most of us. The Commission then had to try to table, in committee 113, proposals that reflected some of the discussion and that would also move the debate forward. Those proposals are now to be seen. Incidentally, the United States was rather late in proposing its own schedules in Geneva.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to establish whether the Community's suggestions, together with the counter proposals from the United States, form a basis for a final agreement. There was a long debate on GATT. In the end, however, the Commission is the authority that must table the proposals; it is not up to agriculture or trade Ministers to formulate a negotiating position as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Council itself, the Portuguese president had put forward a 17-page paper of detailed proposals. A handful of delegations quite liked the general drift. Some disliked everything in the paper and the Germans were especially hostile to virtually the whole litany. Other delegations, including that from the United Kingdom, felt that the proposals would lead us in a direction that we did not want to take—towards a much more quota-dominated and production-limited approach. They would have taken us towards full, permanent compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that the proposals would ultimately have led to agriculture becoming locked in a social security-style ghetto, which did not seem sensible. We saw a danger of finding ourselves agreeing details which, in turn, bound us to a framework from which we could not escape. We thought that that was wrong and that we had to be clear about the direction that we were taking. There was no breakdown of talks; there was good, solid argument. A high-level working party is now trying to resolve the differences and we shall live to fight again at the end of the month.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. May I ask your advice? Although those who devised the European Standing Committee procedure had recourse to the geography of Standing Committees, I think that what they really had in mind was a procedure akin to that of Select Committees. Given that I have a number of questions, can you advise me how to proceed? I shall be glad to give way to hon. Members who wished to ask a supplementary question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Questions are taken at my discretion, and my normal system is to take one question at a time. The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) has been good in not pressing his questions until other hon. Members have concluded their questioning. The hon. Gentleman is most experienced on European matters. Would it be for the convenience of the Committee if he grouped the 12 questions that he may have for the Minister so as to get through them expeditiously? I do not want to take one question followed by another, if that can be avoided. Can the hon. Gentleman put his questions into groups of three?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Questions in groups of three may be for the convenience of all of us. The Minister is extremely good at remembering questions and answering them consecutively but sometimes the detail of a question may not reach him in time for him to give a definitive answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see. The hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) remarked on the last occasion on which I chaired the Committee that the Minister was always helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever. The hon. Gentleman has made a reasonable suggestion. Perhaps the hon. Member for Newham, South will follow it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Hogg. I shall endeavour to combine the two methods advocated, with maximum coherence. If the Minister's replies are short, our exchanges can take the form of a logical dialogue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister about the explanatory memorandum which he signed on 16 December. Part of paragraph 8 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The EC's commitment under the Sugar Protocol of the Lomé Convention, to import cane sugar from certain ACP Countries at certain preferential rates, would have to be abandoned. This would be likely to damage relations with ACP countries seriously. The UK cane refining industry would have to seek alternative sources of supply."</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister still hold to that view? Would not that effectively mean the end of the Lomé Convention on sugar?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What consultations has the Minister had with Commonwealth suppliers and high commissioners and any committees between them on the important statement made by the Government in December?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I maintain the correctness of paragraph 8, which is saying that, if the recommendation of the Court of Auditors—that ACP sugar should no longer be regarded as an import right, that ACP countries should be given financial aid instead of that right to import and should use the aid to subsidise their sugar on world markets—were adopted, the United Kingdom could no longer be assured of the cane sugar that supplies about 50 per cent. of our marketplace, going into Tate and Lyle's refineries. Because refining cane sugar is more expensive than refining beet sugar, it would be difficult to see how a company such as Tate and Lyle could obtain supplies at costs that would enable it to refine profitably. If the company had to import cane in those circumstances, it would have to do so at prices over and above the tariff or protection levied by the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as I stated in paragraph 8, we followed the Court of Auditors and, as a result, cane sugar were regarded as an inconvenience on the European market and then exported to the world market by those countries that did not come to the Sugars Community market, and we did not give a guaranteed price and access, the consequences that I have described would result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that I have an interest in the refining end, an interest in the European Community and a past interest as a member of the board of Christian Aid and as a former member of the Select Committee on Overseas Development. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the arrangement that he mentioned—grants of aid from the EEC to various ACP countries to enable them possibly to export sugar on a world market—would be extremely hazardous, prejudicing these countries' economies and societies in a way comparable to what happens under the current regime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's qualifications for the Committee are such that he is the sort of person one hopes will not attend. However, I am happily able to agree with his sentiments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recall that the House of Commons passed resolutions relating to this matter and to employment in the United Kingdom on the negotiation of the sugar regime that followed accession by one year, in 1974? Has he drawn the resolutions to the attention of the Commission, the Court of Auditors or his colleagues at the Council of Ministers? If so, what was their reaction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say whether we have drawn them to the attention of the Court of Auditors—I do not know quite what input it received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the hon. Gentleman's question was to ascertain whether the United Kingdom is absolutely clear that, in the reform of the sugar regime, we remain committed to the right of the ACP countries to import 1·3 million tonnes of raw cane sugar under the terms of the protocol. The answer is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In respect of the future regime, we know that agriculture affairs come under article 43 and are subject, inside the common agricultural policy, to qualified Sugars majority voting. Matters relating to sugar beet and quotas come within that arrangement. Can the Minister say whether ACP beet sugar imports will run similarly under qualified majority voting? If not, will he say what form of council or decision-making would result in a decision that would, as he agrees, imperil the Lomé arrangement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The protocol is indefinite. It is a Community treaty undertaking. It will not form part of the review of the sugar regime. The Commission will not introduce proposals on the protocol because it is without end. Beet reform decisions will, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, be taken by a qualified majority vote in the Council of Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister, or a colleague at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, if it is involved—especially the right hon. Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker), the Minister for Overseas Development, who may be involved in decision making—would let us have a note on the other matter. Does not the Minister agree that the intervention price of beet sugar comes within majority voting? If the intervention price were set at a level which, while it enabled British, French or German farmers to dispose of at least some of their crops on a given quota, might be too low to permit cane sugar effectively to compete—especially in view of transport costs—in the European market. While the protocol may be without end, as the Minister said, the economics could mean the end of imports of this sugar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but I am not sure whether he is correct. First, ACP countries broadly receive the European price. Over the past couple of years there have been arguments. When the Community cut—for the first and only time—the intervention sugar price of 2 per cent., the ACP countries asked to continue with a higher price. However, the Council of Ministers felt that that was not the right way forward, as they did not want a decoupling between the Community price and the ACP price—such was the heart of the regime for the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The Commission proposed to give some compensatory aid—if I recall correctly, some 30 million ecu—and some of it has been dispersed. I should make it clear that we did not think that that was a good idea; we did not want to drift into the business of giving aid. In the event, the Commission stuck to its guns, and that policy became the Community regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, costs are greater for cane than for beet sugar, and adjustment aid is available, which goes to all the cane refineries in the three relevant countries. That aid is at the level of 15·8 ecu per tonne. In effect, it is a cash subsidy to the refiner to compensate for the greater refining costs of cane sugar. It is an aid financed entirely by the Community, and it is obviously very important to cane refiners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister telling the Committee that aid for diversification will take the form of a bulk transfer to ACP quota sugar countries? Are such countries obliged to support farmers through funding their transport or other costs to enable sugar to be exported at a price that gives a reasonable return? Are the funds necessary to enable farmers to grow sugar and receive appropriate exchange for the products? Is that how the system works?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to pass on that. Would the hon. Gentleman be kind enough to proceed to his next question, and I shall endeavour to become more informed on the issue before he finishes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What contacts have the Government made either with ACP countries that have an organisation in Brussels or with the high commissioners of the British Commonwealth? I asked the question before, but have not received an answer. What reaction has the Minister received from them to the important document that we are debating? Indeed, are they aware of paragraph 8 of the explanatory memorandum, to which I referred earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both my right hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker), the Minister for Overseas Development, and my Department contacted the high commissioners and Ministers in other countries. as the hon. Gentleman said, there is an association of ACP exporters, and I have met the president of that association. I expect to meet him again in respect of the proposals. I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that we would not proceed with whatever proposals resulted without having personal contact with ACP developing countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to now, however, discussion has focused on what level of payment should be received for the 1·3 million tonnes, not about whether it should continue. The level of remuneration is the critical factor, given that the Community is seeking to reduce prices. Regulations provide for the ACP countries to use the money to improve sugar production and cope with price reductions. Existing protocol will not be affected, but increased ACP access could be made through the topping up of Portugal. The guarantee of United Kingdom supply is also covered by article 43 with the qualified majority vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make it absolutely clear that 1·3 million tonnes does not arise. The protocol is not in question. However, as I said earlier, two elements that affect ACP countries would be subject to qualified majority voting. One is
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
arrangements to ensure that Portugal can maintain its cane refineries. Under the present accession agreement, Portugal is supplied with preferential agreements within the world market. It receives about 70,000 to 75,000 tonnes from four named African countries and the rest from the world market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in relation to negotiations with Portugal, we should seek to refine—perhaps I should use a different term!—its relationship with the United Kingdom. Suppliers have sometimes failed to deliver their quotas and refineries in this country have found themselves short of the tonnes required for full capacity. The problem is that top-ups are not specific: they might have been given to refineries elsewhere in the Community. We are trying to supply a mechanism that would ensure that the United Kingdom receives the necessary quantity in circumstances where resources have been diverted elsewhere. On those two matters, there would be a qualified majority vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is encouraging to note that the procedures of the Committee are evolving, perhaps this very morning. I wish to ask my hon. Friend the Minister a few questions following my earlier question about GATT negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the case that the meeting was held in secret, and that the conclusions reached will not be published until such time as the Commission produces its own considered view? If that is not the case, will the Minister say whether there was any prediction of restricting the volume of sugar imports from the Community? If so, it would have a very serious effect on the quota round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should first like to know how far down the list I am in terms of answering the questions of the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would like to know that too. I called the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) because he stood up. I intended to take as many questions from the hon. Member for Newham, South as he wanted to ask. In fairness, I felt that other members of the Committee should be allowed to speak. However, as the Minister said, I should like to know how far advanced we are in dealing with the questions of the hon. Member for Newham, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not attend the famous lunch, and I am profoundly grateful for that. At the time, I was reading the Court of Auditors report on sugar. I can offer only a reported story of what happened at the meeting. It was held in the same secrecy as any other meetings in Brussels. They never work. Two Ministers were present from each country; there were Commission officials; Council officials; interpreters; waiters; and so on. Given that everyone tends to brief quite extensively, anyone who wanted to keep that meeting secret would have been remarkably optimistic. Each delegation expressed its opinion on the GATT talks and gave its advice to the Commission on how the EC's net offer should be framed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was whether the volume of sugar exports should be caught. There is still debate within GATT on whether the restraints on exports should be expressed in budgetary terms or volume terms. The main argument concerns wheat. The United States is anxious to have a volume restriction and I believe that President Bush has told his farmers that he wants to limit Europe's competitive export markets for grain. The nub is on grain and if we cut it on grain, it will not stall anything else.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
There will be constraints and the Community prefers to express those in budgetary terms, but the United States wants them expressed in volume terms. That is part of the negotiations. It is certainly possible that there will be some form of constraint, but it cannot yet be characterised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. There is clearly apprehension about the future. When answering an earlier question from my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) he said that if there is a quota cut, the United Kingdom should do proportionately better. Perhaps I am being dense, so will he explain that? If there is a quota cut, the United Kingdom cannot possibly do better, especially if the ACP countries' 1·3 million tonnes is maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that if we must cut quotas, other countries' quotas should be cut more deeply than ours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), my hon. Friend the Minister implied that Tate and Lyle receive special consideration. That does not sit easily with the text of the motion—
	<br><blockquote><p>"making the regime more open to market forces".</p></blockquote>
Will my hon. Friend concede that other commercial interests should be taken into account? Another substantial company in this country produces sugar and our large agricultural industry produces the raw material for that company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course I would. The aid to Tate and Lyle is not exclusive and cane refiners in France and Portugal receive the same aid for the same reason—because the cost of refining cane sugar is greater than for beet sugar. It is a cost equalisation measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall forbear any questions on the Portuguese matter, which is highly complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that support is provided for growing and marketing sugar. Does that exclude support for assistance in its transport to this country or to Europe? Will the Minister also tell us the amount of EC support for the sugar regime? I understand that, unlike other commodities, export refunds are carried by farmers and/or refiners of beet sugar, but surely there is a broad charge on the CAP for the total support of the sugar regime, including assistance to ACP countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman's first question is that the Commission is studying the case for helping the ACP countries with their freight costs. Now that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned it, I recall that that has been a feature of the demands of some ACP countries. The matter is being studied and we shall try to conclude those studies in time for the review of the regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the overall cost of the regime, I shall tell the hon. Gentleman the figure later, but the self-financing part of the regime derives from the fact that there is a levy of 2 per cent. chargeable on A sugar and 39·5 per cent. on the B quota.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) referred to the Monday meeting. To what extent do the important GATT negotiations, on which so much rests and which, hopefully, are now reaching a conclusion, involve sugar? Does the Minister rest content, concerning the negotiations and proposals from the Secretary general, with the current agreements, or are there pressures for changing the regime in the direction suggested by the auditors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I detect no pressures on the Council to go in the direction of the Court of Auditors on ACP sugar. The Commission declared itself hostile to that part of the report of the Court of Auditors. One would expect it not to like its comments, but on this occasion we agree with the Commission, which does not intend to bring forward revisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the substance of the GATT negotiations, we must not consider the matter only in a Community/American perspective as if those were the only parties to the negotiations. The issues that seem to be contentious include the equilibrium of the Dunkel package in making it work and the question of rebalancing. Some Community members want at least a ceiling to be placed on the amount of cereal substitute products coming into the Community, which is a quid pro quo in the Community's mind for the lowering of the levies on other imports. There is a persisting argument on how volume restraints should be defined. For some member states with a strong export trade—for example, the Netherlands and Denmark—that is the most important element in the talks. It is also important to the United States because of the politics there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another element that is being disputed is the size and nature of the green box—that is, the support which is given to farmers for environmental or non-production purposes, which is not liable to cuts in line with the broad cuts in support. Mr. MacSharry is anxious that his compensatory payments for cereal price cuts should be part of the green box. Some member states, including the United Kingdom, do not want that to happen because we do not want a permanent compensatory mechanism to be built in. The Dunkel figure of a 20 per cent. cut amounts to a stabiliser mechanism. It is difficult to see that there could be a case for compensation for slight price cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the three elements which appear to be in contention in the agricultural sphere. Sugar does not figure in the GATT debates—this has become a hardy annual at every Agriculture Council—and so it has not been at the heart of any contention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his previous reply, which concluded with the Portuguese details, the Minister said that the degree of support for ACP countries was subject, under article 43, to majority voting. If that is so, is it not true that with the lack of support for our point of view in the Agriculture Council and indeed, among finance Ministers, the Council could, under article 43, undermine the competitiveness of cane sugar to the extent of eliminating exports from and refining in this country? The French, who have a departe ment d'outre Mer have a curious arrangement. While the sugar protocol may live on, the industry and the exports from the Commonwealth would disappear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that was a question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer, Mr. Hogg, is that I do not think that will happen. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the way in which Portugal is supplied is an article 43 matter. At present, Portugal has a special arrangement whereby it can supply its cane refineries, and it also has a 60,000 tonnes quota for beet, which it cannot meet. There was an article in 	<i>The Times</i> the other day about a farmer who was trying to grow beet which would have to be shipped to Spain to be refined—I can see the makings of an arrangement in that. If I were a Portuguese Minister, I should be willing to surrender part of that beet quota, for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
which there is precious little or no justification, in return for having a stable arrangement to supply my cane refineries. Portugal is already referring to United Kingdom instances to justify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the problems that the Portuguese have in agriculture, I would be surprised if the other member states use the opportunity to launch an attack on the ACP quota, or the United Kingdom's stake in it. It is likely to go in a trade-off between surrendering a beet quota that Portugal cannot use, and which is pretty absurd, and making sure that Portugal, gets the quota that it needs for its cane refineries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 8910/91, relating to the operation of the common organisation of the market in the sugar and isoglucose sectors; and supports the Government's intention to seek, in the forthcoming review of the Common Agricultural Policy sugar regime, to maintain the viability of both the cane and beet sugar sectors in the United Kingdom, while making the regime more open to market forces and beneficial to consumers.—	<i>[Mr. Curry.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Martlew 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carlisle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought we were to finish at 11.30 am but, obviously, that was when questions had to finish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the Minister. This is the second Committee I have attended on EEC business, and the more European Standing Committees I attend the more I am likely to favour the views of the hon. Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document before us is damning. It says that for more than 20 years the system has been inefficient, but the Minister says that he agrees with a great deal of what has happened and with what is stated in the document. Surely the Minister and his predecessors have for the past 13 years been responsible for much of what has taken place under the sugar regime?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that the consumer has been mentioned on only one occasion. The Minister has many figures in front of him but when I asked how much the British consumer was paying for this EEC policy he was unable to produce a figure. Farmers' interests have been referred to—obviously my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) has a constituency—British Sugar's interest was expressed indirectly, and yet the consumer has not been mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the consumer is paying something between 100 per cent. and 500 per cent. over world prices, varying from time to time. That is an unacceptable cost to the consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate that the hon. Gentleman is not sitting in the Minister's chair. The Minister does not appear to know the cost. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman's percentages are wrong because the world price would not be the same if we had a free market. Having said that, I am sure that the British consumer is paying a heavy price. There is somewhat of a crusade on the prices that consumers pay. If we are talking about the labelling of products, perhaps the EEC levy on a packet of sugar should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is only a take-note motion but I hope that when the Minister negotiates between now and 9 April he will do something to introduce improvements. I hope that my
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
hon. Friend tshe Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark), or another of my hon. Friends, will carry out that work after 9 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in a nonsensical position. The Minister touched on it at the end of his remarks when he talked about the Portuguese quota. When will we get some common sense into the Common Market, where countries that have the climate to produce a certain product are allowed to produce it and countries that cannot do so are not allowed to try? I suspect that we could give our orange quota to the Portuguese and perhaps have its sugar quota.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the same problem with milk. This country could produce enough milk to take care of its own needs and export it, but we are not allowed to do so because of the quota system. That problem exists also in the sugar industry. We are not allowed to produce more, even though we are not self-sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that milk is an analogy with sugar in a certain respect. The reason that our quota of milk was less than it might have been was because of our tradition of supplying New Zealand. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's party is not in favour of scaling down those supplies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both sugar and milk will be adversely affected by the Dunkel proposals if the Government are prepared to accept them. They are both in the same position. We need to get commonsense into the EEC. Countries with a natural climate for producing certain things should be allowed to produce them while others should not be encouraged to do so. I hope that that will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hoped that the Minister would comment on the effect on world prices if we stopped exporting sugar from the United Kingdom. How much would it help the ACP countries if we stopped—we export twice as much sugar as we import—and what effect would that have? I am not advocating that course but we must consider such matters in the context of the EEC. What would be the effect of stopping exports with large subsidies having access to the world market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Weston-super-Mare)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the hon. Gentleman get away with his comment on the balance of trade. We import 1·3 million tonnes of sugar for cane refining, as he well knows. The hon. Gentleman is talking about C sugar and other more complicated matters, not about total imports and exports. We must get the facts right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about not the national position but the European position and exports. That is what I am asking the Minister to consider. What would be the effect on the world market if we stopped having to export so much as a result of over production? Questions have arisen about the cane sugar that is coming into the country. I would be concerned if it were not allowed in because that would almost give a monopoly nationally to British Sugar, which refines the beet, whereas Tate and Lyle, in the main, refines cane sugar. That would not be in the consumers' interests, and probably not in British Sugar's interests, because we might have to tackle the monopoly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a mess but I was encouraged to some extent by the Minister when he said that he was prepared to accept
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
some parts of the report. However, I am worried that what we are being asked to accept in this take-note motion does not go far enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to take up the remarks of the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) because he and I serve on the Select Committee on Agriculture. We have in our presence this morning my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare, the illustrious Chairman of that Committee. It is no secret that that Committee is investigating the trade gap in food and drink products. Consistently, in the evidence that we have so far heard in that inquiry, we have been pointed in the direction of quotas; sugar beet quotas and milk quotas and the effect that they have on our agriculture industry and upon the food processing, which is an important and successful industry. Many times we have been reminded that the effect of sugar quotas—the subject of this morning's debate—upon food processors is potentially extremely damaging. If the sugar that is supplied to food processors in this country is either insufficient in volume or is not at the right price to make a product competitive, there is a real prospect, we have been told, that food processors will leave this country and go elsewhere in continental Europe. That would be most regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate demonstrates yet again that the CAP has little to do with prosperity for agriculture and everything to do with politics. If my hon. Friend the Minister believes that the problems of agriculture in Britain or in other EC countries can be resolved within the CAP, that is his problem. I make no bones about the fact that I am partisan about such matters. I represent a large and important agricultural constituency, and many of my constituents are farmers. Also, I have been employed for 30 years in the food industry, so I have practical experience on both sides of the farm gate. I make no apologies for being partisan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We joined the Community in 1973 under specific conditions. We made agreements with ACP countries, which my hon. Friend the Minister has been at pains this morning to say that he will honour. He said that the United Kingdom remains committed to the right of ACP countries to export to our country 1·3 million tonnes of sugar. Obviously, other countries in the EC have similar historical agreements, of which the Lomé agreement is but one. Prior to 1973 we had unilateral agreements with other countries, but when we joined the EC in effect we pooled our resources and problems with 11 other nations. We brought the ACP protocol in our baggage, and other countries brought the Lomé agreement in theirs. Those agreements should have been pooled along with many other aspects of our national life. The difficulties that emanated from the ACP and Lomé agreements should be part of a common problem that is faced by the Common Market rather than a specific problem that continues to bedevil and dog the British agricultural industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I asked my hon. Friend the Minister directly whether British agriculture was limited to a sugar beet quota that provides, in effect, only 50 per cent. of the domestic consumption of sugar, and whether that was caused by the ACP protocol. He answered, yes. I contend that that view is totally out of date. The whole thrust of the Community is to create harmonisation and convergence, so that the problems of one country become the problems of the Community, and the prosperity of each country
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
becomes the prosperity of the Community. My understanding of the spirit of the Common Market is that it is one for all and all for one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is totally unsatisfactory to have quotas that effectively prevent British agriculture from producing a greater share of what is required by its domestic market. I find that system hard to understand, and I have great difficulty explaining it to farmers in my constituency, especially nowadays, when they are in great need of diversifying or extending into more profitable areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I spent the entire weekend staggering through the Court of Auditors report, which, frankly, made me laugh more than I have done for a long time about a political report. It has the most marvellous air of complete unreality, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The one thing that saddens me about our sitting this morning is the fact that the Minister came here with a motion simply asking us to "take note". A Community document which after 20 years offers a tiny chink of light—it says that the sugar market does not and has not worked—should be treasured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it a tiny chink of light?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a tiny chink of light. The Community rarely acknowledges that something may be wrong with its agricultural policy, let alone does something like conceding after 20 years that the sugar market does not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real situation is quite frightening. There is no mention of the effect on the consumer of this bizarre mish-mash of absolute nonsense. There is no assessment, in real terms, of how much the average housewife pays for this incredible nonsense. The little elements of doubt that creep from time to time into the auditors' report should give us pause for thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly like the passage that sets out the nonsenses of the different quotas and makes it clear why one must be careful of the effect of sugar on the world market. C sugar—which, I should point out, is not derived from sea water—is the third element in the absurd calculation that says, "Take nothing and nothing, add them together and one will make a fortune for various people in the sugar industry." The passage, which is in paragraph 5.10 on page 98 of the report, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"C sugar is the one that has become the real focus for specialization. This non-quota sugar, which receives no Community guarantees and must be sold on the world market at world market prices, is produced in quantities far in excess of the level of variations which can be attributed to weather conditions. This production cannot fail to have budgetary consequences"—</p></blockquote>
that is for the Community to establish—
	<br><blockquote><p>"In fact, the volume of C exports helps to depress the world price and, thus, tends to increase the rate of the export refund".</p></blockquote>
There you have it, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the regime, we do not import cane sugar from the areas that produce it efficiently. Sugar is also often the main crop and economic support of underdeveloped countries. In the Community, we seek to grow sugar beet even in areas that are not climatically suitable for growing it. We also pay considerable amounts of money to people in the market. On top of that, we positively encourage the export of sugar that is made from sugar beet to the world market, where it depresses world prices and affects the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
people who grow cane sugar. We therefore make it difficult for British people who buy sugar to get it at a reasonable price, we depress the world price of sugar, which affects the underdeveloped countries—although we are always mouthing platitudes about protecting them—and, within the Community, we grant much money to the agricultural community and to the people who work in the sugar market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, that is so farcical that it is rather enjoyable. We have entered the realms of a Gogol novel. It is a magnificent creation, and one needs a Gogol to pay full credit to the degree of imagination that went into producing such nonsense. However, that nonsense is paid for by each consumer in the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some bits of the document are wonderful. Paragraph 1.27 on page 24 reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Court pointed out that a considerable deficit had accumulated in this sector"—</p></blockquote>
the sugar sector—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and stressed the need for immediate measures to ensure that this deficit was rapidly covered by adequate levies".</p></blockquote>
It mentions "shortcomings in Community checks" and states
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Court presented an evaluation of the cost to the Community budget of exports of French and Belgian sugar which pass through Dutch ports and are declared at the Dutch paying agency, thus giving the operator an advantage stemming in particular from exchange rate differences".</p></blockquote>
It mentions "the central accounting system". Gogol should be living at this hour. How marvellous it all is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Community is protected at every level. The Minister has not come here, as would have been preferable, with a motion stating that it is clear that the Community accepts that the regime is not working and that we ought to take it back to square one and look at other means of creating a common market, if that is feasible. Above all, the Minister should declare that the Government have no intention of ratting on their ACP quotas and that the maintenance of existing levels is a commitment that we shall honour no matter what the Commission suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that there has been an underachievement of quotas and that, in many instances, ACP countries negotiate each time for an ACP quota without accounting for the fact that they have not been able to use existing quotas. That is understandable under the existing sugar policy, which is nonsensical. But we must declare that it is in the interests of our consumers that all this nonsense be jettisoned as soon as possible. If we cannot, we should at least make transparent to consumers the cost of all that is happening. Even the Court of Auditors makes it plain that the figures are not transparent, or easily accessible or set down in a way that consumers can comprehend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating matters that affect vast numbers of Community consumers without a clear idea of how to proceed. The Minister has set out fairly the problems as he sees them. He has told us that continuing GATT negotiations will be further confused by the added element. But he has not said clearly what he would put in its place and how the Government think we should proceed. It would be a total failure on the part of the House of Commons merely to "take note" of the document, which has budgetary, agriculture, economic and employment implications. The matter should be decided by the House of Commons, not as part of some
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), I groaned when I received the papers at the thought of having to plough through them at the weekend—valuable time which, especially at present, we could devote to more important tasks. I was horrified when I read the document and some of the briefings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sugar market arrangement runs against the grain of what the EC is trying to do, as well as undermining and destroying the Community's attempts to assist the third world. As the hon. Lady rightly said, on the one hand we are increasing prices to EC consumers through the sugar regulations while, on the other, the quota system runs entirely contrary to the concept of a single European market. The quotas reflect historic factors related to the production of the countries in question and in no way relate to their consumption, nor can they be altered without those ridiculous six-hour lunches that Ministers must attend to thrash out the detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, find it illuminating that the Court of Auditors has stated that the market does not work. I do not see that as Gogolesque; I see it as a tragedy for the Community and for all those in the Community who wish to buy sugar. I say that despite the fact that some of us are trying to give up sugar in everything.	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sweet enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And modest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps. The Commissioner has said many times that the quotas are temporary measures. If so, let us make them temporary, and end them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regime is wholly incompatible with what I, as a committed pro-European, am trying to achieve here and outside as a member of the European market. We are attempting to build a Community that will benefit our young people. We want it to provide jobs and opportunities into the 21st century, giving people a chance to compete in a larger market and to take advantage of it. We want it to improve production methods, letting bad methods fall by the wayside. How can that possibly be compatible with national sugar quotas? How can such a system possibly be reconciled with the Community's long-term objectives?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could pan out from the sugar market and say that sugar is merely an extreme example of the common agricultural policy at its worst. The CAP must go lock, stock and barrel. We must begin again if we are serious about building European unity into the next century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct my hon. Friend? Sugar is not the most extreme example of the way in which the CAP works against the interest of British farmers—it is just one more example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just one more, but an extreme example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in an intervention on the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) sugar prices are between 50 per cent. and 500 per cent. higher than the world price, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
fluctuates rapidly because of the dumping of the EC product on to the world market. That means that poor countries, which we are trying to help by writing off their national debt and assisting them through know-how funds and other forms of help, find the underpinning of their economies destroyed by the unloading and dumping of EC sugar from such countries as Germany and France—and even the United Kingdom—on to the world market. That is disgraceful and indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, 4·5 million to 5 million tonnes were dumped in unfair competition with third-world cane sugar producers. I do not believe that our constituents, concerned as they rightly are about world development and world issues, could allow that to be defended in the House of Commons—nor do I wish to defend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have difficulty accepting the motion, which is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee take note of European Community Document No. 8910–91 relating to the operation of the common organisation of the market in … sugar … and supports the Government's intention to seek, in the forthcoming review of the Common Agricultural Policy sugar regime, to maintain the viability of both the cane and beet sugar sectors in the United Kingdom, while making the regime more open to market forces and beneficial to consumers."</p></blockquote>
The best way to help British sugar beet producers would be to abolish the whole system entirely and open it up to market forces. I have a strong belief in the British farming community. It is well able to look after its own interests in a deregulated, open agricultural market. I have no faith whatever in the ability of smaller producers such as Italy, Greece, France and Germany to tackle problems without massive political or financial assistance. That is exactly what they are now getting from the EC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are untenable; they are a total disgrace; and I should like to see the Minister returning to Brussels for the next round of talks and saying, "If there is one thing that we need to do now, it is to abolish these regulations and adopt a similar approach to the entire CAP".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I started by saying that I come from an industrial constituency and I shall end on the same note. Industrialists in my constituency are increasingly worried about the possible failure of GATT, which now represents a large and threatening proposition to us all. If the Americans and Europeans do not agree on GATT, we shall enter a protectionist battle against one another. That would return us to the worst of the recession of the 1930s. We have been through that before. GATT was originally established to prevent any repetition of protectionist battles between the great producing nations of the world. I do not want to see GATT failing under any circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations represent one of the incentives that can be thrown on the table by the EC. We can say that we shall abandon it as part of the negotiation process. That is what I should like to see the EC doing, and I should like to see the British Government pressing for that in Brussels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman to make that point as strongly as possible to the Leader of the House?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Lady was in the Chamber on Monday evening when we debated future notice of the business of the House. It was made clear then that it should be possible to give a fortnight's notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now like to speak about the beet industry. First, I must disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) over the common agricultural policy. The fact is that some Opposition Members are opposed to the CAP. They believe that the agricultural community should be abandoned and that the price is well worth the lowering of food prices if indeed that turns out to be the result of the abandonment of the CAP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no secret about the CAP: it is a protective tariff wall around the Community, which deliberately raises the prices of world foodstuffs to a level that enables farming communities—from Sicily to Greece, Scotland, Ireland or wherever—to make a better living than they would if they had to face countries that are better placed geographically than they are. The argument extends far wider than in relation only to sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sugar is a complicated subject. Its complexity stems from when we cut Napoleon and the French off from the West Indies. It has become progressively more complex worldwide ever since. If the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) thinks that it is complicated in the Community, he should examine the American sugar regime, which is amazingly complicated—due to its relationship with other south American countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We start from the basis of ordinary mortals finding it difficult to understand sugar. When I first joined Manbré Garton, a cane refining company, many years ago, I remember the managing director telling me that it would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
take six months before I understood it all. Some 20 years later, I must say that I am still greatly in doubt about what is an extraordinarily complex subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to draw the Minister's attention to an excellent article on the issues that we are debating. It is entitled "A Political Report" and it is written by Simon Harris, the director of corporate affairs at British Sugar. It appeared in volume 59 of the 	<i>British Sugar Beet Review</i> on 4 November 1991. It covers the Court of Auditors report in some detail. I shall not read extensive chunks from it, as I am sure that the Minister's officials will already have seen it. It is an important article, however, and is well worth reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My earlier complaint about inadequate notice being given is all the stronger because we know that the Community is now considering the future of the sugar regime, which is of crucial interest to British Sugar. British Sugar is not just a supplier of half the nation's sugar, but represents a massive investment in factories, plants, jobs and agriculture. It is one of the most efficient parts of our agricultural scene. Despite the geographical disadvantages of being further north, we can still claim to be among the most efficient producers of sugar in Europe. That has as much to do with the industrial capacity of the company as it has to the competence of growers who contract to grow beet for the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Commission's new arrangements is of great interest to us. This is the only opportunity that we have had to debate that crucial matter for some time—either in Committee or in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known that the United Kingdom sugar market is in deficit. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) has reiterated what was said in the Select Committee in relation to our most recent inquiry. Ministers will know that Mars recently built a factory in France, because it believed that it could secure its supplies both of dairy produce and of sugar more easily in France, where there is a surplus. That is business lost to the United Kingdom. It involves not just manufacturing business and jobs, but the supply of machinery, the use of power and all the other problems associated with driving industry away from this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are good at producing food, especially high value food. Many products require both dairy products and sugar in the first instance. We can estimate that the deficit in the sugar industry in this country will be as high as 100,000 tonnes a year by the mid-1990s. We cannot expand without gaining a higher proportion of the quota. We are under unique limitations. It is no good turning to British Sugar and saying, "You must do better and expand your market," because we cannot. The raw material is simply not available. Even if we get better at growing it, we shall not be able to sell more of the product. We are therefore uniquely disadvantaged compared with our major continental competitors, all of which have substantial quota surpluses which allow them to react to and compete for business in the single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sugar market is now in deficit, and British food companies are much more likely to invest abroad—I gave a good example of that earlier. Conversely, continental competitors will be able to erode British Sugar's position in the United Kingdom market because our ability to
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
compete is restricted by quota. It is inconsistent with the idea of 1992 for the British beet sugar industry to be precluded from competing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not take issue with the admittance of 1·3 million tonnes of cane sugar, whatever the politics that may be involved. British Sugar's policy has never been to take on Tate and Lyle. We have always acknowledged that the cane industry has a special place, and that it provides a form of foreign aid. If we choose to provide foreign aid in that way, side products would be developed, some of which we discussed earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the forthcoming review of the CAP, several matters will be important to the United Kingdom. Temporary national aids should be abolished—some of them date from 1968, for example in Italy. Compensation should be provided with contributions from the sugar industry and the Commission, which would equalise conditions of competition. That is a fair offer. At present, the regime does not cost the Commission anything, in exchequer terms. We are offering to restructure the CAP in sugar—I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South is listening to this—at no cost to the taxpayer and with the Commission's co-operation. That would release a quota of about 700,000 tonnes, and any unused quota from around the Community—about 350,000 tonnes—would be returned to Brussels, partly to be cancelled and partly to be reallocated to help to meet GATT targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reallocation should be based on an equitable formula. For example, the B quota could be set in all countries at a similar percentage level. That would give the United Kingdom a B quota of 22·4 per cent., or an extra 127,296 tonnes, which would bring our total quota from 1·144 million tonnes to 1·271 million tonnes. That would link EC quotas more closely to consumption needs, not simply to past production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night I attended a dinner at which the chairman of Food from Britain addressed British Sugar. He said that it is no good expecting British supermarkets to buy British products unless they can guarantee their supply month in, month out. Both companies in the British sugar industry have been remarkably good at providing a first-class service for a first-class product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will support the British sugar beet industry. He has explained the difficulties. We all know about the appalling game of poker that can be played in the Council of Agriculture Ministers. However, I know my hon. Friend well enough to guess that he is probably rather good at poker. I hope that he will play our hand for us. The matter is extremely important, and there is much at stake, as I have said, in terms of investment and jobs. Our product is universally acclaimed as the finest that the British housewife can buy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin). His remarks about what one might call visbility—or, to use a European Community phrase, transparency—were particularly interesting. Many important matters that subsequently become of vital importance to the people and industries of Britain are debated in relative obscurity in such Committees as this. We are debating them today when other news is supervening. I fear that we can do relatively little about that, for reasons that we all appreciate. However, if any new ways of drawing attention to these issues emerge, I am sure that the Leader of the House, the

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Chairman of the Select Committee on European Legislation and others will be pleased to consider it. I have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman. That has nothing, however, on the secrecy and mystery that surrounds the meeting that we heard about last Monday, or, indeed, the dinners, but I shall not go too far down that road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare for giving us facts and figures relating to beet sugar interests in this country. What is remarkable about the debate is the degree of the bipartisan approach to the facts, if not to the solution, between those with the interests of farmers and beet refiners, overseas producers, the third world, and employees in cane refineries in mind, and those, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), who are concerned about the consumer and the free market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin), who was shocked by the complexities and problems and said that this is not what the EEC is supposed to do. If he reads the objectives of the EEC, as set out in article 3 of the treaty of Rome, and analyses them, he may come to a different conclusion. Alas, as we all know, the perceived objectives of European unity and its place in the world—they cannot be separated—are not always what some people analyse as the motivation behind those who are most enthusiastic for the treaties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the origins of the sugar regime, which go back to the negotiations of 1971 and 1972, and, indeed, to 1973 and 1974. As the Committee will recall, the basis of the sugar regime was agreed only subsequent to our membership of the European Community because talks about sugar went on for another year after our accession. When that period is written about it will be seen that it was the renegotiation of the sugar protocol, during the period of the Labour Administration's "renegotiation"of the treaty of accession, that was pehaps the main feature of that process. It was during that renegotiation in the autumn of 1974 that the original motion was passed by the House, following an amendment that rejected the then Commission's proposal for an EEC sugar regime. It was said that the proposal was not good enough and that we had to protect the interests of our Commonwealth suppliers and our own domestic industry. In other words, the cane that we are now debating was a derogation from at least the intentions of the then Commission. I suspect that but for that renegotiation that might not have been obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangement did not come about without some injury. Our Australian cousins were exporting a good deal of raw sugar to us and we had to sacrifice that to get what we have discussed today. It is only in the past few days that remarks have been passed by politicians in Australia about the abandonment by the United Kingdom of its Commonwealth. No doubt that particular arrangement is better understood in Townsville in Queensland than it is in this country. I understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I find more difficult is the possible position of Caribbean and Pacific small islands, whose only means of sustenance is by sugar exports, and the position that now confronts them. I shall come to that in due course. The burden of the question that I was fortunate enough to ask the Minister earlier—I am not sure whether you, Mr. Hogg, or other colleagues understood its sequence—inexorably leads us to that unwelcome conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should recount an incident during that period of renegotiation which, in a sense, sums up the matter.
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Appropriately enough, it comes from a former employee of the Tate and Lyle refinery in my constituency who followed events will concern. He recalled the occasion when the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath) went to see President Pompidou at a time before our accession when negotiatons had stalled on Commonwealth sugar and New Zealand butter and lamb. After discussions between the right hon. Gentleman and President Pompidou the matter was cleared and negotiations went ahead. The gentleman concerned came up to me and said, "Mr. Spearing, that Pompidou, saw Mr. 'eath coming." We have that comment from a sugar employee. It was realised after that agreement, although we had the Lomé convention and its protocol, that because of surplus sugar in the Community, cane sugar and its suppliers from the Commonwealth would be under constant pressure, and so it has proved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the quinquennial price arrangements which were negotiated and the not, apparently, unreasonable arrangement whereby the price of sugar in this country is linked to the intervention price. When that was agreed, perhaps we had no choice, but the possible consequences of that linkage may not have been foreseen. The production costs in any one ACP country—I speak, in particular about Mauritius and Fiji, which are our major suppliers and have very few other economic bases on which to rely—depend upon the costs of labour and material and upon the cost of transport. That is why I was glad to hear the Minister say that the Commission was considering support for transport as well as support for the cost of growing in those islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Scot and a Clydesider, Mr. Hogg, you will know that the size of ships has rapidly increased. When larger ships cannot approach the relatively small ports in some of the islands, the cost of transport in a smaller ship will be greater. That adds the disadvantage of transport costs to the existing costs of refining that have to be borne.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, anybody might ask why we have these arrangements. I think that the answer comes partly from the hon. Member for Stockton, South, who acceded to what I might call a moral responsibility of the EEC—or "Europeaan Union" as we may call it if certain events occur. As we all know from the GATT negotiations, which are now in a critical phase, so much depends on the relationships of the EEC with the rest of the world in any commodity, and not only sugar. There is also the linkage between the cost of the CAP, its structure, export demands, world prices an world agriculture. All of that is crucial. Therefore the EEC cannot shut itself off by a series of common Community tariffs, still less in terms of the form and extent of agricultural support from the rest of the world. The GATT has proved that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that the personal circumstances relating to any candidate in the presidential elections, the choices open to the President of the United States, his campaign and his reaction to the GATT negotiations could have profound consequences for agriculture in Britain, in Europe and in the world generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EC cannot opt out of the world agricultural scene or the world environmental scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the radio this morning the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) pooh-poohed environmental matters—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like anyone to think that the entire Conservative party signs up to everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am sure. I was not about to suggest that—indeed, the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) was at that time expressing constructive dissent, which no doubt would have been the reaction of most members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My bipartisan point is that the world agricultural regime and world use of energy cannot be dissociated from the total world picture and extends wider than GATT. The United Nations conference on trade and development has not been mentioned, but its arrangements for the sustenance of communities whose only source of income is from agriculture and whose only advantage is the sun—it is a potent force in the production of sugar—is recognised worldwide. Decisions by the Council of Ministers, the finance Ministers and at an increasing number of decision-making levels in the EC are tied in with that. Sugar is the acid test of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Commonwealth is still important and the European Community accepted responsibility for that at the time of the renegotiation. I am sure that that responsibility is recognised in the United Nations, which is becoming more important in the world—we are grateful for that—due to events further east. The relationship of the EC with the the United Nations and UNCTAD is also important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat my quotation from the explanatory memorandum:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The EC's commitment under the Sugar Protocol of the Lomé Convention, to import cane sugar from certain ACP countries at preferential rates would have to be abandoned. This would be likely to damage relations with ACP countries seriously. The United Kingdom cane refining industry would have to seek alternative sources of supply."</p></blockquote>
That would mean the end of that supply and would affect the sustenance of those countries which would have to get rid of their sugar production on the world market. Such a prospect is not only contrary to the obligations which the EC accepted when we joined, but runs counter to the interests of the Community as a commercial unitary organisation in the world. All our commercial negotiations are dealt with by the Commission and the Council and it is of the utmost importance that the matter is kept in perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We depend on the continued import of cane sugar to this country. Perhaps even more important is the employment and trade that the islands to which I referred are able to enjoy on their own account. Trade is much better than aid, and it is better for farmers to receive prices for their crops—that is the purpose of the CAP—than handouts from a bureaucracy or Government, on which they then depend and which in turn depend on the largesse of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apparently, the trend is in the opposite direction. The Minister referred to possible compensation and the flow of money that would be necessary if the amount of sugar at the right prices were reduced. Where and under whose auspices are the appropriate decisions made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to press the Minister because I know that he is negotiating hard. I believe that he said in his final reply to what may have been an overlong but logical build-up of a case—that happens sometimes in Select Committees—that such matters are subject to qualified
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
majority vote, but that he hoped that the matter would not come to that and that he would be surprised if it did. I hope that he is right, but the constitutional position is that we could be outvoted under the Euro-constitution, the constitution of the proto-European union or whatever it may be called. The treaty of Rome, supplemented by what remains of the Single European Act, amounts to a written constitution. American committees would refer to that constantly but we, because of our unfamiliarity, do not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council of Agriculture Ministers or any other council in the pyramid of councils constituting the European Community must realise that, in their voting patterns, they have in their hands something of crucial importance to the relationship of the EC with the third world and to the bona fides of the whole of "democratic western Europe" in respect of agriculture, environment, the United Nations and all that world citizenship means. It has been important to our own parliamentary democracy, which is entrenched within our part at least of the EC, that the scene has been made clearer this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his exposition and look forward to his closing comments. We must wait and see whether an amendment appears when the matter reaches the Floor of the House consequent upon our proceedings today. Various matters have been raised and perhaps when the Minister replies he will add something to the perspective to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may change the motion slightly by Standing Order and if he plans to do so, perhaps he will write to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare and all of us to draw our attention to that. The motion is right up to a point, but, for the reasons that have been adduced, it could be strengthened along the lines that I suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, let me deal with the motion. I have served on the Committee on many occasions and I have not tried to pretend that I can change things that I cannot change. I have never tried to give an unrealistic assessment of the Council's position. I accept that the motion is relatively anodyne. I hope that hon. Members accept that the statements that I have made and those that I shall make should be considered with the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is a Court of Auditors report and as such the Council does not have to vote on it, although the Council must take note of what it says. The report should inform not only the proposals that the Commission puts to the Council but the way in which the Council responds to those proposals. However, the report cannot change anything because the Council will not vote on it. That is why the motion is as it is. I am seeking to give the Committee an absolutely clear idea of the practical options that are open to the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the second achievement of the day. First, we had the glimpse of light that the Court of Auditors has admitted that something in the EC has not worked. Now, my hon. Friend the Minister has admitted that his motion is anodyne. When we return to the House after the election and my hon. Friend the Minister puts more motions before the Committee, will he ask us to do something or to support the Government rather than just take note of documents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been occasions when I have done exactly that. I have said that the very strong views expressed in the Committee will be of assistance to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Committee generally agrees with the bulk of the Court of Auditors report in so far as it refers to the best sector. We disagree about the parts of the report that refer to the cane sector. I would be dishonest if I said that the Committee's views would be reflected in any similar forum in any part of the Community. I do not pretend that there is a large majority waiting to support radical reform. I am being honest with the Committee when I say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all grateful to the Minister for his honesty and openness, which are very helpful. Does not the Minister believe that his hand would be strengthened if he were to take from the House a very clear statement of our view? We do not say that he might find himself in a minority of one—not an altogether unique position for British Ministers—but does he not accept that it might help him if the motion said that we noted the auditors' report but nevertheless, regret what it says?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the form of the sugar regime is debated, we shall be in the unique position of holding the chair. Therefore, we will be able to influence the debate in a way that we would not normally be able to do, because the presidency writes any compromise that has to be formulated. I am sure that Her Majesty's Government will have to heart—I use the phrase used in the famous exchange to which the hon. Member for Newham, South referred—the points that have been made about the importance that is attached to ensuring that the agreement with the ACP countries lies at the heart of our arrangements for sugar. I accept that completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point made by the hon. Member for Newham, South and by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill), the protocol to which they referred and the sugar arrangements are part of the Lomé convention. Agriculture Ministers cannot renegotiate the Lomé convention. Other issues, such as the future of the beet regime in the European Community and the particular arrangements that might apply to Portugal, come under qualified majority procedures. But Ministers do not have the means to get their hands on that protocol to the Lomé convention. I wanted to make that absolutely clear. I do not attribute any great sentiments of selflessness to agriculture Ministers but, even with the worst will in the world, they cannot attack that protocol because of its status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) that the Community price of sugar is two and half times the world price and that the budgetary cost of the sugar regime if £2 billion a year. I hesitate to give a cost to consumers of the regime because the quota system is restrictive, processing is a complex operation and the number of companies in the marketplace is limited. The price that is ultimately charged to consumers does not merely reflect the costs that flow automatically from the regime; other costs are involved. We would have to make a series of assumptions and that would not advance us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that we should produce where the climate is right. I invite him to visit an English vineyard and make that suggestion to the people who have devoted
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
much energy to producing English wine. I have to deal with that sector and it causes me more difficulties than sugar because of the amount of time involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You should not drink it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to make the hon. Lady privy to my drinking habits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not dissent from what my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) said about quotas. When the Select Committee makes its report, I shall be interested to see whether it recommends the abolition of the quota for potatoes, which is the one quota that is purely national. That would be entirely consistent with his remarks. I await with interest the Select Committee's reflections on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among farmers there is a widespread belief that this system does them quite well. My hon. Friend said that farmers do not like quotas and want to get rid of them. I am not sure that many farmers would endorse that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not actually say that. I spoke in more general terms about the industry on both sides of the farm gate—the producers and the processors. I accept that many farmers would be reluctant to have the present situation changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) said, we are approaching a GATT deal on ACP sugar. It would be impossible to reconcile the Community's withdrawal from these arrangements with any conceivable deal in GATT. The Community would be putting itself in an impossible position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom has A and B quota and can produce C, but if we want more sugar from British farmers to be consumed in the United Kingdom we must bear in mind that we export 200,000 tonnes of sugar a year, and it is not all C sugar. Therefore, it would be possible to divert some of that to the domestic marketplace. Tate and Lyle can also export from the United Kingdom. Some of the Cairns group are players in sugar. As the hon. Member for Carlisle said, the Australians are major producers. If there were a greater free-for-all, developing countries would not necessarily be the gainers. There are some highly capatilised and efficient producers in the developed tropical or semi-tropical world which would be looking to increase their supplies. As the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich said, there is a charge on the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also said that I had not given a strong enough commitment. I said that the United Kingdom was wholly committed to the continuation of the supply of 1·3 million tonnes to the European Community. My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) said that I had not spelt out intentions. The Commission has to make its proposal. The elements that are indispensable to reform are cuts in price and in quotas, an end to storage aid, greater certainty of supplies to the United Kingdom and Portugal because that benefits developing countries, and the end to national aids in the beet sector. If those points were not covered, we could not reach the threshold of reform of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must see what Mr. MacSharry comes up with and decide how to deal with the problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare is right that beet sugar dates from Napoleon and the continental system. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
British are to blame for that because the continental blockade pushed the continent into producing beet. That has had far-reaching consequences for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with most of the points. On the questions about costs to which I have not been able to reply, I will ensure that the details are given. I believe that the Committee is agreed on our fundamental approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the opinions that have been expressed, will the Minsiter consider beefing up the motion that he will place before the House, which need not be the same as the take-note motion before the Committee today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, as I was not quite sure of the technique. From what he says, I understand that I do not have to table an amendment on the hoof in Committee. I shall consider whether we can find a motion that accurately reflects the views of the Committee but which would still be appropriate when we negotiate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. You will remember that some time ago the Committee discussed a motion that the Minister for Roads and Traffic had put before us. A written amendment was made and agreed upon by the Committee. Later, however, the Minister reported a different resolution to the House and sent us all a polite letter telling us that our objections had been noted, or some such anodyne phrase. In that case, it may be desirable for the Minister to take cognisance of what the Committee says and to beef up his motion, but in the earlier case it was clearly the view of the Committee and of the House when the matter was discussed on the Floor of the House that such amendments should not be made by Ministers without consultation after the motion leaves the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is that I shall report the motion that is carried or not carried, as the case may be, in the Committee. It is then open to the Minister to table an entirely different motion on the same subject, if he chooses. The hon. Gentleman's point of order, which was an explanation of the proceedings, was correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. There have been discussions on the matter in the House, in which the hon. Member for Stockton, South participated, and further correspondence. Exception was taken to the fact that the motion put before the House by the Minister was not in accordance with the spirit and conclusions of debate. Whether flexibility should exist is a separate matter, but at present it is available and could be used constructively for the purposes that I outlined, provided that the consultation to which the Minister referred took place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can settle the matter immediately. I understand that what hon. Members want is a reference to the ACP countries. I realise that there are other concerns, but I am sure that I could add to the motion words such as "to assert the continued right of the ACP countries to export 1·3 million tonnes of cane sugar to the Community on preferential terms". Subject to our getting the wording absolutely right, if that were added it would cover the specific point. It does not affect other points of
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
concern as it stands autonomously, but it would convey the message and we could regard the matter as having been dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to be absolutely clear, the Minister could take the course of action that he proposes—not now, but in the motion which he has the right to place before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I acknowledge that as I am not a member of the Committee, I cannot vote, but it seems a strange procedure that we should delegate Ministers to write motions after a debate. That is an odd way to proceed. I want to put down a marker and perhaps you will note my concerns in any further deliberations that you may have on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman remarked earlier that we seem to have an evolving procedure and he is absolutely correct. As the Chairman of the Committee, I have faced severe problems with our procedure, which I constantly report to the Chairman of Ways and Means, whom I see quite a lot. I also report to him the comments of members of the Committee. He is interested in the way in which we handle such problems. A Committee of the House is considering the procedures of European Standing Committees A and B. I therefore accept the hon. Gentleman's comments. However, I feel that we are rather repeating ourselves on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I agree that we are evolving, but I thought that we had evolved beyond the point at which Ministers came to Committee and took away subjects for further motions which they subsequently put before the House. I thought that we had set our face against doing that and I hope that we have done so successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is totally inappropriate to consider the Committee's procedures now—as it was to consider the procedures of the House on Monday night—at the tail-end of a Parliament. I feel strongly that when the new House of Commons is convened—I very much hope to be here, and to help with its deliberations—there should be a serious discussion about the workings of European Standing Committees and of the House. Having a debate on a Monday night, when a general election is in the offing and all hon. Members want to be in their constituencies, is far from satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That latter point, of course, is not a matter for me. I may have great status as Chairman of European Standing Committee A but it does not extend without limit. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's first point is no. The Standing Orders remain what they were when the Committees were set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
