	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Howells. I seek your guidance. As the subject of today's debate relates to the social charter, could you confirm that despite the decision of Her Majesty's Government to opt out of the social chapter, it is business as usual for this Committee—which deals much more than European Standing Committee A with matters relating to the social charter—and that it will be business as usual until the treaty itself is modified by the Council of Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Howells. The social dimension of the European Community was well covered in exchanges with the Prime Minister on his return from Maastricht. I suspect that the explanatory memorandum was on its way long before the heads of Government came together, so it cannot be a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. In reply, I must point out that the questions and the debate should be related to the role and competence of the Community in promoting the dignity of women and men at work. A wider debate on Community social policy generally would not be appreciated. I hope that those guidelines will help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Robert Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I start with some background information, so that we have the framework and context in our minds. In answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr Godman), in 1990, long before the social charter, the Government supported a Council resolution on the protection of the dignity of women and men at work. That was an Irish presidency initiative, not a Commission initiative. Among other things, it called on the European Commission to draw up a code of good conduct based on best practice in member states and to provide practical guidance to employers, trade unions and employees on how to combat and deal with sexual harassment at work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke of a Council resolution of 1990, and said that it was supported long before the social charter. Surely that is a mistake. The social charter came into existence in 1989, or even earlier. Perhaps the Minister meant the social chapter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is quite right; she calls on her expertise as a former member of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
European Parliament. I cannot remember the exact year in which the social charter was adopted. It may have been 1990. However—social chapter or social charter—it is clear that the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow was wrong to suggest that the subject arose under the social charter. It arose from an Irish presidency initiative. Its legal basis has nothing to do with the social charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code comes forward as an annex to a Commission recommendation, urging member states to promote awareness of the code generally, and especially to encourage its adoption in the public sector. Both the code and the recommendation, which was approved by the Commission on 27 November, urge recognition of the fact that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and as such may contravene the equal treatment directive. That is another aspect of the legal base that I draw to the attention of the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code and the recommendation are not binding on member states. However, member states were asked to express their support for the code and recommendation at the Labour and Social Affairs Council on 3 December by signing a declaration. That declaration is designed to give political and moral weight to the recommendation and code. The Committee will be pleased to hear that at the Council, the Government maintained the United Kingdom's parliamentary scrutiny reserve on the declaration, pending today's debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems ludicrous that the Council of Ministers has already met this month to discuss the memorandum. I appreciate what the Minister said about the Government reserving their position and seeking advice from the Committee, but should not that matter have come to the Committee before the Council of Ministers met?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Howells. Is it in order to break with what seems to have become a precedent in Committees: that interventions should not be allowed during the Minister's opening statement, because it is followed immediately by questions in the hour allotted to the statement and question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Howells. I believe that it is the procedure—certainly for this Committee—for the Minister to make a brief speech. "Brief' has been defined as less than 10 minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has always been the procedure in Standing Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had been speaking for only a minute, so the point of the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow was very unfair. I say to the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) that I am happy to answer his questions during my speech, although it might be more helpful if I were allowed to set out the background to the proposal and if the Committee were then to make use of the question and answer procedure. The answer to the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
Gentleman's question is that it is notoriously difficult to arrange a synchronisation of the timetable of the Council of Ministers and the timetable of the Committee. All that we can do, if the timetables cannot be made to coincide, is to maintain a parliamentary reserve, which is what we have done. That is a perfectly acceptable and straightforward way of dealing with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essentially the declaration to which the parliamentary scrutiny procedures apply and which therefore was the main focus of the Department's explanatory memorandum. Members of the Committee have a copy of that document. Of course, for the purposes of debate it is impossible to consider the declaration in isolation from the code and recommendation. I shall say more about those documents later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a brief resumé of the 1990 resolution and each of the documents before us. I re-emphasise their non-binding nature. All the documents cover all conduct of a sexual nature that violates the dignity of women and men at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, we were pleased to support the resolution, because we condemn all forms of sexual harassment. The resolution calls on member states to develop, in particular, awareness campaigns, based on best practice, to counter sexual harassment and remind employers of their responsibility to seek to ensure that the workplace is free from sexual harassment and victimisation. So the emphasis is on increasing people's awareness. During negotiations on the resolution the United Kingdom made a number of suggestions for improvement, which were accepted, I am happy to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice was formally launched by the Commission on 27 November. It is based on best practice in member states and provides practical guidance to employers, trade unions and employees on how to deal with and, better still, to prevent sexual harassment at work. For the purposes of the code, sexual harassment is defined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, or other conduct based on sex affecting the dignity of women and men at work. This can include unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct".</p></blockquote>
The code goes on to give advice on how best to pursue positive measures in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the area of prevention, employers are asked to consider issuing policy statements about sexual harassment at work and to ensure that employees have the opportunity to complain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The setting up of a proper complaints procedure is recommended, as are undertakings that allegations of sexual harassment will be dealt with speedily and confidentially, and that employees will be protected against victimisation or retaliation for bringing a complaint. The complaints procedure should specify that appropriate disciplinary measures will be taken against employees found guilty of sexual harassment. Of course—and this is crucial—the code recognises that informal solutions are to be preferred wherever possible, and it sets out a range of ideas about how that should be given effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade unions are recommended to formulate and issue policy statements to raise awareness and help
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
to create a climate in which sexual harassment is neither condoned nor ignored. They are urged to raise the matter with employers, as appropriate. The code asks unions to treat complaints sympathetically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code also places obligations on employees. They should ensure that standards of conduct for themselves and colleagues do not cause offence. They can make it clear that they find such behaviour unacceptable, and they can support colleagues who suffer such treatment and are considering making a complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission recommendation accompanying the code recommends that member states—that applies to the United Kingdom—take action to promote awareness of the kind of conduct specified as being unacceptable, and that we implement the code of practice in the public sector to serve as an example. Employers generally, and employee representatives, should develop measures to implement the code, as it applies to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft declaration registers the council's endorsement of the general objective of the Commission recommendation and, among other things, invites member states to develop coherent, integrated policies to prevent and combat sexual harassment, taking account of the Commission recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The non-binding nature of the documents means that there is no obligation on the United Kingdom to implement faithfully every suggestion contained in the code of practice. The declaration reflects our view that policies in such an area are for development and implementation by member states acting individually. This is the principle of subsidiarity. This is an eminently sensible and practical way to proceed, which respects the principle of diversity of approach among member states. This brings me to the legal position. Reference has been made to the possibility that sexual harassment may be contrary to the equal treatment directive. What must also be said is that only in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland is there clear judicial acceptance in our national law that proven sexual harassment may in certain circumstances be unlawful sex discrimination. The Commission themselves has acknowledged this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under our sex discrimination legislation not only are employers responsible for their own conduct but they are also liable for any discriminatory acts done by their employees in the course of their employment, unless the employer can show that he took such steps as were reasonably practicable to prevent them. This can act as a powerful impetus to employers to take sexual harassment seriously. Equally importantly, the law also protects complainants and anyone else giving evidence in a case against any subsequent victimisation by their employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a growing body of case law in the United Kingdom to support the view that sexual harassment constitutes sex discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act, 1975. What has emerged from this is that this country, along with Ireland, is in the vanguard in the Community in providing a remedy at civil law for people who wish to bring complaints
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
of sexual harassment under the sex discrimination legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general terms the various initiatives call on member states to raise awareness of the problem of sexual harassment. This is a sensible step with which we agree. I believe that there is already a high level of awareness, especially in the wake of recent, highly publicised examples, particularly in the United States. We need to see that this is translated into a spreading of good practice—of which I am pleased to say there are some notable examples among leading United Kingdom employers, including the Civil Service, British Rail, British Telecom, the high street banks, ICI, Shell, ESSO, to name but some. These organisations already have well-developed arrangements to deal with complaints of sexual harassment from members of staff. I know from first hand that the civil service practice is well in line with the measures advocated in the codes. So we do have excellent models of good practice to commend to employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we must be realistic about how much we ask businesses to do when it comes to devising and implementing policies, and we must bear in mind that smaller employers do not have the same administrative back-up as the pioneering organisations I have just mentioned. The Commission's code certainly recognises this. On the other hand, this kind of discrimination is abhorrent and all reasonable steps need to be taken to deal with it, where it exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I welcome the Minister's positive tone in introducing the memorandum. Clearly he accepts that sexual harassment is an issue that the Government, employers and employees have a responsibility to drive out of the workplace because of the seriousness with which this issue should be viewed, and because of its serious impact on the lives of women at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister accept the argument in the memorandum that sexual harassment is often a reflection of women's status more generally at the workplace, and that policies to combat sexual harassment need to go wider than simply a code of practice? We need clear direction from the Government in setting out policies that take more fully into account the role of women in the workplace. The Government and all other commentators know that the overwhelming majority of new entrants to the labour market over the next decade will be women, especially in areas of work where women have not traditionally been employed. Can the Minister tell us the Government's views on sexual harassment, not only in the context of this code of practice but, more generally, in terms of workplace relations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) raises a wide and important question. I agree that the problem of sexual harassment must be seen against a wider background. However, sexual harassment can go both ways—it is not just a matter of the protection of women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speak for yourself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) comes to my assistance. There is case law on the issue, in Britain and abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The questions go wider than the hon. Member for Stretford suggested. It is not simply a question of the protection of women, but of relationships among employees in the workplace. The aim must be to create a more humane and civilised environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's view is that that is primarily a matter for employers. It will obviously be a matter for the Government as a substantial employer, and in that role we constantly take steps to improve the climate in which our business is conducted. One of the best examples comes from my Department. The employment service has been undergoing a programme of integration of its offices, bringing together the payment and advisory functions, and we are taking the opportunity to restructure the interior of many of our offices, to get away from the old high counters and screens and to move towards open-plan offices, desks, and named individual staff addressing individual claimants—that was one of the subjects of our jobseekers charter that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State launched yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such a non-threatening, non-intimidatory, more friendly atmosphere, there will be a more humane and civilised relationship not only between our staff and our clients and customers, but among our staff. That is the approach that should be followed. Employers should think seriously about how to upgrade and improve the quality of the working environment for all employees. The problems of sexual harassment, which often arise out of tense or stereotypical workplace relationships, will tend to dissolve. The hon. Member for Stretford was right to make the point, although it may take us wider than the scope of the measure, which focuses clearly and specifically on the problem of sexual harassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made it clear that the initiative that lies behind the documents, particularly the draft recommendation, dates from before the Maastricht summit. Is it the Government's view that, by the application of the subsidiarity rule included in the Maastricht treaty, this area of activity and initiative would still lie within the competence of the Community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a borderlines case. In so far as the measure is not binding—it represents an injunction, but not a legally binding injunction, to promote awareness of an issue that we agree is important and on which we agree with the sense of the Community—it is compatible with the principle of subsidiarity. That principle relates less to declarations and affirmations of moral values and concerns than to legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the equal treatment directive would have implications in so far as sexual harassment could give rise to discrimination. That is established in our national domestic law and has been the subject of court cases. The question is how any declaration on subsidiarity at Maastricht Would relate to previously-enacted directives and to their interpretation by the European Court of Justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Subsidiarity would become a serious issue if the measure went beyond the status of a recommendation and became a legally binding enactment. At this stage, and in the form that it is presented, the subsidiarity objection does not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will agree that everyone should abide by good practice. However, there is a variation of culture from country to country and interpretations of the proposal will affect work forces in different ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister accept that in the context of a growing unity in Europe, with working people and managers moving from country to country, there is an important and growing need for people to be aware of the expectations of the country to which they are moving? There may be strong grounds for common guidelines throughout the European Community to ensure that certain standards are attained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the basic thinking behind the code which, in a sense, embodies common guidelines. They are of a general character, which is inevitable and appropriate. It is for each member state to translate the injunction of the code, especially in relation to the raising of awareness, into its own domestic practice, whether by legislation or by some other means. We already have arrangements in our legislation which have been in existence for some time. It is important to say that often social protection in the United Kingdom is superior to that in other member states. This is an example. The question for us and for other EC countries is how to put the code into practice, to respond to the mobility of workers across frontiers, to which the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) drew attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been taking advice through the advisory committee on women's employment, which I chair, and considering a large-scale campaign, based on a leaflet, to draw the attention of employers and employees to the issues and problems involved. It will include how to tackle procedures and complaints, and other matters. Other countries will adopt different ways of dealing with the problem. As the hon. Gentleman said, there are cultural differences and diversities in the Community; that is why it is important to recognise the diversity of approach to this important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Government's approach, which is different from that in other areas where humane and human behaviour needs to be fostered. The memorandum seeks to ensure that unwanted, unreasonable and offensive conduct is recognised and, if it is not stopped, to ensure that some way is found to take up the problem of people behaving offensively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) said. That is precisely the purpose of the measure and the reason why the Government support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Heal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the fact that the only recourse available for those involved is
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. In October and November, the Equal Opportunities Commission urged the Government to strengthen that Act to include its own definition of harassment. Such an amendment would clarify women's recourse and class sexual harassment as discrimination. I understand that that proposal was put to the Home Office. Can the Minister say whether the Government have taken a decision on that amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are reviewing and discussing with the Equal Opportunities Commission a range of proposals for improvement of the law relating to sexual discimination. The EOC put together a package of wide-ranging proposals which touch on the business of many Government Departments. We are co-ordinating the review across Whitehall. Discussions are continuing with the EOC about the interpretation of some proposals that are ambiguous or obscure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not correct to say that only the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 covers the question of sexual harassment in the United Kingdom. Employment protection legislation covers unfair dismissal in circumstances involving sexual harassment. That has been established in case law. There are also criminal law offences connected with assault, which are clearly more aggravated cases of sexual harassment. I could go into gory details and explain how the criminal law can bite on such cases. A wide range of measures and legal elements are in play. One of the Government's aims in producing a leaflet and the ensuing campaign is to clarify and explain what the law is and the legal redress that is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, however, that it is common ground that this problem cannot be solved by the law alone. The hon. Member for Stretford was right to put the matter as he did. The question is one not of law but of general workplace relationships, involving attitudes, awareness and values. That has to be tackled on a voluntary basis; everybody must co-operate and be engaged in solving the problem. People should own the policy, as it were, and the law should act as a longstop, a background and a framework. I hope that the Committee will agree that that general approach is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If sexual harassment has ever taken place within the august portals of the Minister's Department, I should be interested to hear the Minister's definition of it. He said that the declaration has no legal validity, yet it could be referred to by a complainant in a court case or an industrial tribunal hearing involving allegations of sexual harassment. Over time, would not a declaration gain some legal validity in such cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subject to legal advice on that point, I think that the hon. Gentleman is probably right that the declaration could be taken into account. However, I am not sure that it would add anything, as the concept of sexual harassment, as defined in the code, is more or less incline with the way in which the matter is handled in our courts and tribunals. The code's definition of sexual harassment is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, or other conduct based on sex affecting the dignity of women and men at work, including unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) asked about the employment service, which has a code of practice on the matter. We have established a dedicated hotline that is available to all staff as an integral part of our equal opportunities action and issued in the summer a guidance leaflet on sexual harassment. We have a management guidance pack, in addition to the advice in the Department's personnel handbook. That pack has been put together for managers in each region. We are also taking action to ensure that allegations or complaints are urgently investigated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wareing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) mentioned subsidiarity, and I am interested in the Minister's opinion. Most sexual harassment affects women. Women are disadvantaged, in relation to job opportunities, just as much in Britain as elsewhere. The Government must do more than say that they agree that sexual harassment is dreadful and must be thwarted. We are at a disadvantage, because we rejected the social chapter. The social chapter would make possible other health and safety legislation, whch could cover issues such as maximum hours of work, maternity leave and assistance to pregnant women at work. Discrimination is more likely to continue in Britain than in the other 11 member states of the European Community. That negates the possibility of giving women the opportunities that they should have. If they had those opportunities and held many of the higher posts in industry and the services, there would be less sexual harassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not yet in the position where I have to appeal to you, Mr. Howells, for protection. Intellectually, the hon Gentleman is right. It is possible for a palaeontologist to reconstruct a dinosaur from one bone. One can take an issue, generalise it, work out the implications and spread them out endlessly, until one has brought into play the whole of human knowledge and aspiration. I do not believe that the Committee wishes to do that, or that it is a wise method of approaching our subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The references that the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing) made to the social chapter are factually incorrect. Health and safety provisions are well established in the treaty. Britain accepts those provisions—indeed we lead the field in the European Community on health and safety matters. We have implemented all the Community directives. Apart from Germany, we are the only country to have done that. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the pregnant women directive. That is part of the social action programme, which is distinct from the social chapter or charter. The issue was resolved a month ago. It is widely known that the United Kingdom participated in a decision to implement the pregnant women directive. The hon. Gentleman could construct endless connections between a series of issues that would have a plausible, logical and intellectual relevance to sexual harassment, but that would divert the Committee from its task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland were the only two countries whose national legislation included redress for sexual harassment. He also mentioned the Community's equal treatment directive and implied that it could be relevant to the problem of sexual harassment. Could a case of sexual harassment be taken to the European Court under the equal treatment directive? Would that option be open to people in other member states where no national legislation exists to redress the problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the principle of subsidiarity. He seemed to believe that that principle should govern policy on sexual harassment. Yet his interpretation of subsidiarity is strange. He interprets it as a principle that governs whether a decision should be taken at Community level or by the member states. My understanding is that decisions should be made at the lowest appropriate level. That could mean locally, regionally, nationally—in Scotland and Wales—or by the member state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms Quin) is an expert in such matters. She tempts me into discussing subsidiarity. We shall probably define that concept as we go along. No one has promulgated an authoritative definition. I do not know whether anyone is capable of doing that, except perhaps His Holiness the Pope. The phrase originated in the discussions about the internal constitutional structure of the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church discussed whether decisions should be taken at papal, episcopal or a more local level. That is the historical background to the phrase. Nobody has defined subsidiarity exactly. For the purposes of the Community it governs whether decisions should be taken at Community level or by the member state. I agree with the hon. Lady that the position of the regions and sub-units within the member states has become important in the subsidiarity debate, because of the position of the German länder. For the purpose of our discussions, subsidiarity is in respect of relations between member states and the centre. Nobody suggests that there should be a special Scottish or Welsh policy. I hope that I have not set off the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that an appeal can be made to the European Court of Justice about any aspect of Community law. It must in theory be possible for a case of sexual harassment to arise from our, or another member state's, application of the equal treatment directive. I do not want to be drawn too far—it would not be helpful to speculate on the legal proceedings of other countries. In so far as the equal treatment directive has implications for sexual harassment as a potential source of employment discrimination, it must be a matter that can be referred to the European Court of Justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is disturbing to hear that our model for subsidiarity is the Roman Catholic Church. Will Europe be as open, non-authoritarian and democratic as the Roman Catholic Church? I am horrified at the thought of a Jacques Delors speaking ex cathedra to give us our instructions from Brussels. Perish that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
thought, enthusiastic as I am about the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary spoke of the publicity that has been given to sexual harassment, especially because of events in America. Unfortunately, much of that publicity would discourage, not encourage, women from complaining. We cannot solve all the world's problems by legislation. The difficulty lies in changing people's attitudes. We should do that with more enthusiasm and proper resources. Do the Government intend to do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I was discussing the origin of the concept of subsidiarity. I agree with his comments on how it might be applied in the European Community and the desirability of avoiding anything that smacks of theocracy in the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made an interesting and important point about cases in America. I do not want to speculate on the experience of other countries, but as a lay person who watched those events, I agree that they have not been helpful. The televising of the proceedings in those cases was questionable. They showed how extraordinarily difficult it is to prove sexual harassment to the standard required by the law to establish an offence. Such cases are fraught with the difficulties of subjectivity. What is harassment to one person may not constitue harassment to another. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we must be careful about the law in such matters. The law must exist, but the problem is better dealt with in a non-coercive, co-operative way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are fortunate to have before the Committee such an expert on Europe as my hon. Friend the Minister. He mentioned subsidiarity. Who will decide whether these cases fall to member states or to the Commission for determination? Does this matter fall under the provisions of the social chapter, from which we have opted out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That matter is not covered by the social chapter. It was a presidency, not a Commission, initiative and relates to the Community's existing established competence. If my hon. Friend can wait, I shall give him the precise words on subsidiarity in the Maastricht agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his approach to subsidiarity, the Minister is in danger of suffering from acute political schizophrenia. It is one thing to argue that Europe has a diversity of cultures and that we need a diversity of approaches but quite another to say that when it comes to the United Kingdom, everything must be unified, centralised and seen through the eyes of Whitehall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Minister accepts that there are many differences in emphasis within the United Kingdom. I have in mind activities in Northern Ireland, the strong grip of the Methodist church in parts of Wales only a generation ago and the law in Scotland. Where there is a diversity of approaches, even among
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
companies, it is not unreasonable in the context of subsidiarity to consider whether the system should also be flexible enough to accommodate the differences that exist in different parts of these islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to quarrel with the hon. Gentleman. I think that he knows that I agree with him on this matter. The intellectual concept of subsidiarity embraces all levels of authority. One of the units in the Church is the family and one of the principles is that, when it is appropriate to deal with decisions at a family level, that should be done. One can look beyond the family to the small community of a village or town, to a region, a nation, a state and the supranational institutions in all their variety. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that subsidiarity is a question of how we locate the responsibility for making decisions at any given level in that entire structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the purposes of this discussion and of the debate in the Community, the issue of subsidiarity is essentially about the distribution of powers and responsibilities between the centre in Brussels and the member states. As I said earlier, however, the role of the länder in Germany raises the question of its application at regional level. Future changes in our constitution, of the kind that the hon. Gentleman would welcome, could lead us to move in the same direction. I am not pre-empting that possibility—indeed, we are not debating it at this stage. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman and I have any quarrel over this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) about subsidiarity. A new article 3b is to be added to the treaty of Rome. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Community shall act within the limits of the powers conferred upon it by this Treaty and of the objectives assigned to it therein."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it shall act within its competence—that is a distinct concept. The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the areas which do not fall within its exclusive jurisdiction, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of proposed action, be better achieved by the Community.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that a certain amount of jurisprudence exists in the form of civil actions which have been brought in this country and in the Republic of Ireland. Did any of those cases involve the harassment of men by women or the harassment of persons by others of the same sex, or do we take it that, although the draft declaration is drafted in very even-handed terms, historically and in practice such cases involve only the harassment of women by men?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; My information is that the cases in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland have exclusively involved harassment of women by men. In other jurisdictions there are cases of harassment of men by women and, I surmise,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
harassment between those of the same sex. That issue has not come before our courts or tribunals as case law, but such cases have occurred in other jurisdictions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in what the Under-Secretary said about the code of practice in the Employment Service. Does he agree that codes of practice must acknowledge that established grievance procedures may not be the best means to follow up complaints about this ugly problem? For example, in Scotland, the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union negotiated several agreements with the Clydesdale bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the TSB bank to have harassment counsellors in those banks. Those counsellors are all members of the union and are able to deal with the problem. In several cases, the perpetrators of sexual harassment are the immediate superiors of the victims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting example. I should not like to comment further without seeing the details, but that is a good example of a trade union's responsible action in the context, no doubt, of a responsible employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right. The issue raises problems which cut across established grievance procedures for the reason that he gives, which is why we have established a hotline in the Employment Service. Those matters will be taken into account when we draw up the leaflet and organise the campaign. We must decide what words we can use about the establishment of special types of procedure. The hon. Gentleman is right in principle: we must deal with that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's proposals are welcome, as is their attitude to the problem, but will not the lack of definition in the article and the general terms of the code of practice give some member states the opportunity to do little or nothing at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. There is always that danger. One wants to maintain a generality that does not prescribe inappropriately in the diversity of national circumstances, but that generality must be sufficiently precise to ensure that action follows. Subsidiarity is a sensible principle because Community legislators face that dilemma. A problem should not be tackled unless it can be tackled effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An agreement has been made that, within three years of the declaration, the Commission will report on what has been done in member states. The findings will then be considered. I have no doubt that member states will take the matter seriously. The Dutch presidency, which expires at the end of the year, organised an informal conference on the subject, which officials from my Department and from other member states attended. All member states have the will to tacke this serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be able to study the Commission's findings in three year's time. I guess that it will be found that the United Kingdom has led the field in taking measures not only to implement the spirit and
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
letter of Community law but to ensure the highest possible social protection for our people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Government's commitment to tackling this horrible and obnoxious problem. Does the Minister agree that we must educate people? To tackle the problem effectively, his Department, employers and trade unions must ensure that it is taken seriously at all levels in the workplace. Grievance procedures should lead to disciplinary procedures. Sexual harassment, even of the mildest kind, should result in charges of serious industrial misconduct being laid against the perpetrator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point about complaints procedures and penalties for such behaviour. Those matters will have to be considered in framing the leaflet and organising the campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industrial tribunals have found that the penalties are insufficient. We are aware of that and I shall discuss it with the advisory committee. The hon. Member for Barking (Ms Richardson) is a member of that committee and will assist in the discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is possible that greater public awareness will result in more cases being taken to tribunals, even though the incidence of the offence has gone down? Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a parallel to be drawn with the successful campaign to reduce drinking and driving, which involved not just exhortation but a measurement, once or twice a year, of the numbers involved? Will there be surveys that include questions about this issue or will such questions be incorporated in the workplace industrial relations survey which takes place occasionally—unless it has been abolished? Is it possible to produce figures showing whether the number of incidents is decreasing? If it is shown that the situation is improving, that reinforces the raising of awareness which has occurred and stresses the reduction in unacceptable behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole Committee is aware of the distinguished part played by my hon. Friend in the campaign against drinking and driving. He was responsible for more prosecutions, not more offences. As he pointed out, there is a slight perversity in such issues: the more that attention is paid to them, the more serious the problem appears, simply because there is more reporting and debate. In reality, because the issues are considered more seriously and action is taken, there may be a fundamental improvement in the underlying situation. I guess that we can expect an apparent increase in the future, but I earnestly hope that the Government will not be found responsible. Oppositions tend to blame the Government whether that is appropriate or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised an interesting point and suggested that there should be research to establish baselines of existing levels of sexual harassment. We do not have much knowledge about that and I shall reflect on that point. It will be difficult to establish such baselines, even through anonymous surveys, because of problems of definition. However, research
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
on that point would be useful and I shall endeavour to have some carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would happen if the Committee were to decline to vote for the motion? Would the Government oppose the draft declaration at the next Council meeting? Could the draft declaration be voted on under qualified majority voting and promulgated by the Council, despite the opposition of the United Kingdom Government? If it were voted for, could such a resolution be prayed in aid before the British courts? In an earlier response, my hon. Friend said that that could happen if the resolution went through in the normal way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is a well-known tease. My understanding is that if the Committee rejected the motion relating to the declaration, the matter would have to go to the House. The House would have to make a decision and, no doubt, some hon. Friends would have views on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Howells. Perhaps you will confirm that, whatever the Committee does, the motion goes to the House in the form in which it comes to the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The House has the last word. The question then is what the Government will do. To answer my hon. Friend, this matter is not subject to qualified majority voting. The instructions of the House would be binding on the Government. We would thus be in a position to follow such instructions and block the measure. It could not be prayed in aid in court proceedings because it would not be a valid legal act of the European Community, or the European Union as we must get used to calling it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to bring the Minister's attention back to cases brought before industrial tribunals. I have been away from industrial relations legislation, practice and procedures for some years now—I have been in this place since 1983. Am I right in thinking that a person cannot bring a case to an industrial tribunal unless he or she has been in continuous employment for two years? I hope that I am wrong about that, because young women and teenagers who are just joining firms are particularly susceptible to this form of harassment. They may not be members of trade unions or they may be employed by firms where there is no trade union representation. The largest employer in my constituency, IBM, is a non-union firm but, I hasten to add, it has excellent terms and conditions of employment. Young women and, indeed, teenage boys can face harassment. If they had less than two years' service with a company, would they be able to bring a case before an industrial tribunal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right: there is a general period of service bar in cases of unfair dismissal brought to industrial tribunals, but there is no question of a service bar in relation to action under the sex discrimination legislation. A person who had been employed for less than two years could
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
not take up the issue as an unfair dismissal case but could bring it forward as a sex discrimination case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As we have run out of questions, I call the Minister to move the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of the proposals described in the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Department of Employment on 25th November 1991 relating to the protection of the dignity of women and men at work; believes that policies to combat sexual harassment at work are for development and implementation of Member States acting individually; agrees that the Recommendation and Code of Practice provide a basis for such policy developments; welcomes the Government's support for the need to spread awareness; and approves of the Government's support for the Declaration.—[	<i>Mr. Jackson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.28 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that this is one of your first forays into a European Standing Committee, Mr. Howells. The way in which matters have been conducted so far is interesting. We have had an almost schizophrenic debate—on the Government side it has been between the Eurosceptics and the Minister and on the Opposition side it has been about the explanatory memorandum and the dignity of men and women at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Important issues have been raised, even in the European context. I would normally support the views of the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) on the need for a more devolved system of Government, but when the subject is essentially the role of women—I accept the Minister's comment that men are involved, too—there is a need for something that transcends national boundaries. We need to look at matters on a European level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are talking about a free market in labour throughout the Community, regional variation is not acceptable. One may tell the next generation of young people in Britain that their future labour market is no longer Britain but the whole Community and that they can expect protection under national legislation or even, through the principle of subsidiarity, under regional governments, which the next Labour Government will establish in the north-west of England. But if that protection is not to be afforded in a particular region of Italy or Germany, that should be unacceptable to the whole Committee. The issue of subsidiarity does not lend credence to the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to consider carefully the role of the law. I do not dissent from the general view that the law provides a longstop. I put to the Minister the point that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs Heal). The Equal Opportunities Commission urged the Government to reconsider the need to introduce the definition of sexual harassment in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 because of the need to clarify the law. The Minister said that the law has served as a longstop. Some victims of sexual harassment have been able to take their cases to court. Those cases mostly involved aggravated sexual harassment and not the norm that most women face. The law is a long and complicated process, to which women resort only if they are determined or because the offence against
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
them is grave. I urge the Minister to consider the role the law should play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning's debate has been reasonably civilised. My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) mentioned the way in which matters on the other side of the Atlantic were treated by the American and British media. There is always a danger of discussions descending into prurient pokiness when the subject is as difficult as this one is for most societies to discuss. Such discussions then fail to reflect the seriousness of the subject. Sexual harassment has been a taboo subject, but every survey that has been undertaken has shown how serious the problem is. I welcomed the point raised by the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) about the need for a proper approach to a survey of harassment. Yesterday, a study which was reported to the British Psychological Society showed that sexual harassment of nurses by patients was a very serious problem. I am especially interested in that because my wife is a nurse. Research found that 60 per cent of the nurses who were interviewed at one hospital had suffered some form of sexual harassment. In almost all those cases, the offenders had been male patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) asked whether the issue applied equally to men and women. The explanatory memorandum does not refer to the sex of the victim or the perpetrator. To that extent, it applies equally to men and women, but we must accept that the overwhelming problem is one of male harassment of women in the workplace. The study to which I just referred found that 21 out of 35 nurses questioned on two wards had been sexually harassed. On 17 occasions, the culprit was a male patient. I hope that the Committee will accept that that level of harassment is extremely serious. Some of the cases reported by nurses involved serious physical assaults. In others, nurses had been verbally abused or made the butt of jokes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The study also said that sexual harassment was treated as part of the job. That is the problem. In a job like nursing, in which there are still strong hierarchical views, the stereotypes remain. The role of women is seen as inferior in power relationships. Sexual harassment becomes a part not of the sexual climate as such but of power relationships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And a manifestation of inadequacy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister says, it is also a demonstration of inadequacy and it needs to be recognised as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report goes on to quote the general secretary of the Confederation of Health Service Employees:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The situation is not made any better by the attitude of some people in male-dominated hospital hierarchies and by some male doctors"—</p></blockquote>
one of the major problems in an area such as medicine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many surveys tend to reinforce the same conclusions. A study conducted by the Alfred Marks employment agency found that of its 5,000 employees, 60 per cent had experience of sexual harassment. Moreover, the average number of
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
incidents was four per person questioned—a very high level of harassment. So we are not dealing with a minor or trivial problem that happens only from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of those questioned by Alfred Marks, only one in 20 registered a formal complaint as it was felt that complaint procedures were not adequate. Of those who did complain, only half received a satisfactory response from management, which is not surprising if we recall that only 20 per cent of companies have any policy on sexual harassment. I am not even sure of the basis on which it is claimed that 20 per cent of companies have such a policy.

All that shows clearly that the lives of many women are seriously affected by sexual harassment. It can cause some women severe psychological damage, or even cause them to resign from their employment. I hope that the Minister will be at one with me on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the strong intention of the Government and the Opposition to assist the change of the role of women in the labour market. We recognise that traditional patterns of employment can no longer exist in modern society. Women inevitably move into non-traditional areas of employment, which re-emphasises the importance of treating the sexual harassment of women seriously. Obviously, there is a presumption that women working in areas where they have not been traditionally employed may experience sexual harassment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall provide the Committee with an example of a young woman who was employed by Islington borough council. She is on record as having the highest level of compensation awarded—£15,000—by a tribunal. Payment was made by the council without a full hearing. That young woman suffered an extraordinary level of harassment: she was subjected to sexual abuse and intimidation, and one of her colleagues indecently exposed himself to her. In the end, she resigned, which was sad because she had chosen and wanted to work in a non-traditional area of employment as a female painter and decorator. If we really want to encourage more women to opt for that sort of work, we must have a proper code of practice on sexual harassment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already said that the law provides some basis for women to pursue their complaints and grievances. Case law has developed through the tribunal system; and there is the Sex Discrimination Act and other legislation that makes it possible for women to pursue a claim. However, I urge the Minister to take seriously the issue posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman), for in certain circumstances the two-year rule could prevent people from having access to the law. If so, it runs counter to what the Minister has said that he wants to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should remember that young people are most likely to face sexual harassment in the early weeks and months of employment. If there is to be a time-barrier to pursuing complaints, we must reconsider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I re-emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire on whether we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
now need, irrespective of the code of practice, to introduce a stronger legal definition of sexual harassment and place that firmly under the 1975 Act. That would make it clear to all concerned that legal protection was available for all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is working in co-operation not only with my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms Richardson), but with the Equal Opportunities Commission and representatives of the trade unions. We are trying to break down stereotypes, and it is refreshing to hear a Minister talking with conviction about the role of trade unions. That is a welcome departure from recent employment Ministers. I say that sincerely and, if the Secretary of State makes problems about it, the Minister may refer him to me and I will try to sort him out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that the code of practice is properly communicated. We are not trying to achieve a consensus—if we could achieve that, the code of practice would be unnecessary. We need a code of practice and for matters to be handled in such a way that ordinary people will accept that we are trying to achieve the minimum acceptable in providing protection for both men and women at work, but especially for the many women victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to existing codes of practice. Imperial Chemical Industries plc has a code of practice which is compatible with the memorandum and says that it receives very few complaints. That is odd in an organisation as large as ICI. Perhaps it has model employees, or perhaps, even with a code of practice, we are only just beginning to hear the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leicester city council went further and introduced confidantes so that victims could talk to someone. There was apparently such a need for that service that the confidantes began to suffer from pressure because of the sheer volume of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice is welcome, but we must ensure that it works properly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to my hon. Friend. Surely there is a duty on the personnel departments which interview complainers. Some personnel managers will be male, and female complainers may be reluctant to say what has happened. It is important to provide training, not only for counsellors, but for those who interview complainers, whether in civil service organisations, large or medium companies or small firms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but in fairness to the memorandum, I must say that it refers to the need for training and other issues—for example, who will receive complaints. In line management structure, one of the more likely people to perpetrate harassment is the person with whom the victim works. Such issues need specific attention, and the memorandum tries to cover them. The Minister said that the Department was consulting widely on publicity, and I trust that he will bear in mind what my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
We have made clear that we broadly agree with what the Government are trying to achieve. We have had one of our more civilised debates, when both sides of the Committee have been constructive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to finish with an issue that I raised earlier. Sexual harassment at work must be seen in the wider context of women in the workplace. The Minister's reply did not cover all the important issues, such as raising the status of women, pay, how women are treated, the jobs to which women can gain access, training and so on, which have an impact on the power relations that confront women at work. A code of practice can improve matters, but we must deal with those issues if we are to offer real protection for women at work and, ultimately, for men as well. The Minister must not ignore that and must take on board the importance of being able to offer dignity at work, which is the title of the memorandum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.46 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State should share the credit for conducting the debate in ways that will be mildly helpful to those who will deal with this issue in future. Many people are affected by this matter during some part of their lives. It is a shame that the media show little interest in it, except when it becomes headline news. For example, the details of a couple's marriage are spread over the front page today of one of our popular newspapers, which has 3 million readers, just because of a work relationship. I should not legislate against that, but it should be discouraged. Similarly, we should have got beyond the stage of putting people's photographs in the newspapers when they are elected general secretaries of trade unions or deputy chairmen of banks just because they are black.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A little legislation regarding the issue under debate today may help, but most action should come not from reducing the numbers who are offended but from reducing the offending itself. There is an inverse parallel with the issue of drinking and driving for which the legislation has not been changed since 1967. The offending has deduced, and has reduced most recently and most dramatically among those who were the worst offenders, with hardly anyone knowing how or why that has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 	<i>The Times</i> on Monday, Peter Riddell wrote that the Government had fallen too often into the habit of saying that where there is a problem there must be legislation, with the implicit acceptance that legislation will alleviate the problem. We should consider the trend figures, which are produced often and promptly. In cases of drinking and driving, 19 times out of 20 it is a male problem. A woman is on the receiving end of offending behaviour in the form of sexual harassment 99 times out of 100. Perhaps a national survey could be undertaken. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary should refer his officials to the Central Office of Information, which has ways of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
discovering such information without asking directly, "Have you been harassed at work? Was it sexual harassment and what type was it?" It can find out what people are worried about and is able to extrapolate regularly from that so that it has reasonably reliable evidence of what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend also that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary tries to do within the Department of Employment group what I encouraged it to do when I was Under-Secretary of State for Employment. I regarded the Department as an area where surveys could be useful to management. What comes to mind is the work that the race relations employment advisory service did for the Department of Employment, as though it were an outside employer. It produced a report that was placed in the Library—it was not hidden—but which, in essence, was dynamite in terms of indirect discrimination within the Government service. Good action followed from that, and no one should be worried about openness in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one could recognise the possibility of research and investigation taking place within a Department, it would help to raise awareness. It would also help to show that management and unions were determined to eliminate where possible, but certainly to reduce, unacceptable and offensive behaviour between employees. If my hon. Friend maintains his reputation as someone who can talk cheerfully about trade unions, I warn him from my experience. When I stopped being Under-Secretary of State for Employment. I was not replaced and, within five days, my office was demolished with a sledgehammer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the importance of procedures and checking what would happen if the Committee did, or did not, accept the proposal and what would happen if the House of Commons refused to let the Government lift the reserve. Useful procedures should be followed. If they are not followed, the reason why should be brought into the open. Last week, European Standing Committee A considered the technical specifications for speed limiters. Just three months before the issue was to be finally determined, the Commission introduced a completely different document that dealt with the maximum speeds of heavy goods vehicles and coaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that instance, the European Commission did not follow its own procedures. From my knowledge, the European Economic and Social Research Council was not consulted, and the trade unions did not get a chance to say a word about it. The proposal was passed into law which, of course, will now be binding. I accept that that does not apply to the proposal that we are discussing. But we must take every opportunity of saying to the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the authorities in the House that we take seriously the procedures that we are meant to follow. They exist for a reason, and, if it were necessary ever to short-circuit them, the reason for so doing must be brought into the open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now experiencing a procedure that is seldom considered by our Committees, because most of the proposals that are examined by European
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Standing Committee B and European Standing Committee A are part of directive. I believe that as little as possible should be in directives and that as much information as possible should be attached to the sort of issue that we are discussing. I do not object to the Council of Ministers working on such issues at a European level, nor do I have a problem with the European Parliament dealing with them. But, wherever possible, those involved in the discussions should be asking for the facts; they should consider the extent of the problem, ask for examples of how it has been reduced and debate what can be done to bring people in countries and regions within the European Community together to start tackling the problem more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must go beyond the stage of saying, "We must raise awareness", although that is often true. We must get across to people that such conduct is bad and that they should not behave in such a way. We must then internalise the matter and say, "I should not be doing it", or, "My Department, company or trade union should not be doing it." We must declare our intention that we shall not put up with it and be able to look in the mirror and say, "Honestly, it does not happen here," or that the level of incidence has been reduced dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have focused too often solely on the directive level—the national legislation level, and, to pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), we have even focused on legislation that affects one part of the United Kingdom. We do not necessarily deal with the level of offending and discuss whether the offence should be a criminal or civil offence. I urge the Foreign and Commonwealth Office when it reads the report of our proceedings—I doubt if any other Department will read it—to encourage the Council of Ministers to find ways of presenting more issues in the way in which this issue has been introduced. In that way, there will be a code of practice that can be of value to people considering national and company codes of practice. We could then find ways of monitoring the levels of incidence. We are discussing unwanted, unreasonable and offensive conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stretford, referred to the Leicester scheme, which has a system of confidantes. A useful development, which has been adopted by Britain and the rest of the European Community from Scandinavian countries, is the system of ombudsmen, who consider whether there are reasonable grounds for complaint. Such a procedure would normally take place after people had tried to take up the issue directly with the authority, organisation or administration responsible for the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The confidante system is valuable. Many people want to ask, "Is this something that I have to put up with, or can anything be done about it?", without necessarily speaking to a supervisor or to the person who caused the offence. That system should be included on the agenda of several organisations, which could learn from Leicester's achievements and see how it could be spread. A similar system exists in the House of Commons, where a friendly Whip is available to give guidance about not just debates but other issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would offer to help my hon. Friend, perhaps on a private basis. If new employees are facing verbal or physical harassment they need to establish whether it should be rejected by their fellow employees, as well as by the employer. People need guidance about what is socially acceptable. They would benefit from guidance being more open and from the establishment of desirable and required standards of behaviour. IBM stipulates certain standards of behaviour, and ICI has an established structure and ethos to ensure such standards. It would be useful if similar standards applied elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to attract the undesirable attention of the tabloid newspapers, which harassed the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywell (Ms Short). I do not say that companies should prevent people from bringing their own newspapers into work, but we should grow out of the display of bodies in places of work. Most of the issues are about growing out of patterns of behaviour, and treating men and women with dignity and equality. Now that 40 or 50 per cent of medical school students are women, the old tendency for me to be doctors and women to be nurses with change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask whether the issue is a suitable case for the Euro-septicaemia which seems to arise in our debates. The issue can be treated on a national level as seriously as it is treated at European Community level. I hope that next time the issue is debated the situation will have improved and that it will be possible to identify and deal effectively with those areas where the position has not improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.59 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Sylvia Heal (Mid-Staffordshire)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the recommendation and the Government's acceptance of it. I trust that they will actively promote the fact that sexual harassment is unacceptable in the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sexual harassment has been defined in many different ways, and I hope that the definition set out in the resolution will become the standard. For a
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
long time, sexual harassment was considered to be a trivial issue that seriously affected only a few people. That may be because survey results do not give an accurate picture. The lack of formal complaints may be due to the absence of a formal complaints or grievances procedure, but it is more likely to reflect a person's anxiety about complaining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent survey carried out by Alfred Marks, the employment agency, showed that 51 per cent of those interviewed said that they had been sexually harassed at work, of whom 53 per cent were so distressed that they left their jobs. Dr. Lynda Carr, head of the employment department of the Equal Opportunities Commission, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In a population with 11 million working women, that means literally millions of pounds wasted every year on extra recruitment, advertising and training costs."</p></blockquote>
Certainly, the incidence and assessment of sexual harassment is also dependent on the way in which it is defined and the perception of events and actions by the victims. Therefore, the definition should not restrict sexual harassment to male behaviour towards women and exclude the reverse behaviour of women towards men or, indeed, that involving people of the same gender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sexual harassment may cause increasing anxiety as the fear associated with AIDS spreads. Employees who are believed or known to be homosexual may be harassed by other employees, creating a stressful, intimidating working environment. While recognising that the problem is not exclusive to women, I shall concentrate my remarks on the difficulties that they face in dealing with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the reasons why sexual harassment occurs are associated with the sex role stereotyping of men and women. Male sex roles have traditionally encouraged men to be strong, aggressive, tough, dominant and competitive, whereas female sex roles have encouraged women to be passive, gentle, submissive and receptive to the male initiative. The opportunity to demonstrate dominance is also made possible by work structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Men are often motivated by the need to exert influence and dominance over women and competitive advantages over male colleagues. The male power structure is, of course, so beguiling—witness the support that men get from being seen as "one of the boys". For years, women have been subjected to various forms of sexual harassment at work by male colleagues telling crude jokes which they know will embarrass their female colleagues, the display of sexually suggestive posters or calendars which cause offence and the use of lewd language. Those forms may include unwelcome sexual advances from touching through to the extreme of rape or requests for sexual favours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sexual harassment has nothing to do with lust. It is commonly an exhibition of power, either by showing hostility to women—"Keep them in their place"—or linking it to the enhancement of job prospects. Sexual harassment has been seen by women as an inevitable, albeit unpleasant, part of working life. But, thank goodness, more and more women are not prepared to tolerate such behaviour. They are gaining the confidence and courage to complain and report such incidents to their employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
As we heard today, a number of employers such as the civil service and some of the leading banks and industrial firms have established codes of practice. The Trades Union Congress has issued guidelines, and unions have been active in promoting that aspect of employment procedure. Because sexual harassment is not explicitly prohibited under United Kingdom law, cases have been brought under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. There have been some successful claims, most notably Strathclyde regional council 	<i>v.</i> Porcelli in 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Organisations such as Women Against Sexual Harassment that offer legal and practical advice as well as counselling are helping women to make complaints. It is in the interests of both employers and employees that the problem be addressed. For those women affected, harassment can be damaging to health, as it induces stress, depression, low morale and falling efficiency and it can also result in absenteeism, all of which result in costs to employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who are being sexually harassed can feel helpless. They believe that nothing can be done to alleviate the problem and consequently they take no action. Most people believe that their complaints would be seen as trivial or, even worse, that they would be branded as troublemakers. Often the feeling that they may be foolish to complain is reinforced by managers who laugh at such problems and say, "I'm sure you can handle it". When the senior person is male, it will often be difficult for him to understand what such women feel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of those—there are many more—are reasons why there should be a policy and a code of practice. We must make it clear that sexual harassment will not be tolerated in the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome and endorse the recommendations and I look forward to the Government quickly launching their campaign and promoting the code of practice. We need to give guidance to employers to establish such a practice—and to form a complaints procedure. It is important, as the recommendation suggests, to offer training and advice to those staff who are to receive the complaints and implement the grievance procedure. It is also important that people who complain are allowed representation by a friend, colleague or trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a harasser is found guilty, he should be transferred to another place of work. Only this week, the case of a constituent who was harassed has been brought to my attention. She found the courage to complain, a hearing took place and the perpetrator was found guilty of gross misconduct. My constituent was denied the opportunity to have a friend or colleague with her at the hearing. Moreover, the perpetrator was allowed to remain at his place of work. I intend to take up the matter, as that is totally unacceptable and it will not encourage women to make such complaints in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse all that has been said in the hope that the code or practice will soon be established. I agree with the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) that we should consider initiating surveys. Perhaps we should also review how the code of practice works during the three-year period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was listening. I approved of the Minister's statement that sexual harassment should not become a crime under criminal law. Clearly, many offences—some involving sexual behaviour—are rightly crimes under criminal law. Indecent exposure, assault and rape, which are extremely serious crimes, are also, properly, crimes under criminal law, as are many other offences. I am not suggesting that we wind down criminal law; I say simply that this offence would not be a proper addition to crimes under that law. I hope that I have made my position clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is, as the Minister said, a subjective concept. The sort of activity which to one person is harassment may not necessarily be to another. It is extremely difficult to verify allegations. Cases in the United States recently have shown the absurdities that can occur when judicial or quasi-judicial procedures attempt to investigate allegations of so-called sexual harassment. So, while sexual harassment is a geninue problem and a proper subject for civil action and codes of behaviour, it would not be right to extend Government intervention and concern into including a concept of sexual harassment in criminal law. I endorse the Minister's view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that this is an appropriate subject for the European Communty. I take some comfort from the Minister's answer that he confides the issue as a borderline case as regards subsidiarity. This is as about as strong a statement on the subject as I am likely to extract from a Minister of the Crown in Committee. I hope that the matter will be edged back across the borderline and the Community persuaded to drop initiatives of this sort. I see no prima facie reason why Community action would be more effective than action by member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Community has enormous and important tasks for which action at Community level is likely to be more effective than action taken by member states. The Maastricht summit has given the Community new powers in environmental and other areas, including foreign policy. There is a suspicion that Community institutions—especially the Commission—are becoming overburdened and will not have sufficient resources to cope adequately with the tremendous tasks that must be achieved before 1996 when the issue is reviewed again. It seems a complete waste of resources for the Community to involve itself in the enormous effort that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
documents before us reflect. In practice, the effect will be minimal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What action will be required if the Council declaration is accepted? Paragraph 3a states that the Council has asked the Commission
	<br><blockquote><p>"to promote adequate exchanges of information with a view to developing existing knowledge and experiences in Member States, regarding the prevention of sexual harassment at work."</p></blockquote>
An exchange of information can do no harm. The question is whether the effort and resources expended in compiling and exchanging the information—always an elaborate bureaucratic exercise when undertaken by the Commission—is worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3b) states that the Commission is asked
	<br><blockquote><p>"to look for criteria to enable the efficiency of measures taken in Member States to be assessed, taking into consideration any criteria already existing."</p></blockquote>
It gets worse. There is a request to the Commission to implement the criteria referred to when drawing up the report, and so on. What is happening is that Mrs Papandreou is making one more bid to expand her empire. Yet more civil servants will be employed in Brussels, on high salaries, producing endless reports of this type. The Minister has already given the assurance that there is no suggestion of producing a directive. Therefore, all that will emerge will be reports and recommendations of an advisory or informatory nature which no doubt will duplicate the vast amount of good work being done by all sorts of bodies, as well as by the various Governments of member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is an important function of hon. Members not merely to dream up new possible areas for Government action and new rules, regulations and initiatives to be taken by bureaucracies on a national and Community level, but also to represent the interests of our constituents and taxpayers by trying to see where we can reduce the sphere of Government action, or—where it is required—see that it is more efficiently delivered. The Commission is clearly going over the top.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall in a moment, but I wish to offer my thanks to the Minister and his officials for the delivery of these documents. It is important for the Committee to receive documents at least a few days before its sitting. I am interested to hear what the Procedure Committee has had to say about this Committee. The report was published at 10 o'clock this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to endorse the hon. Gentleman's words of appreciation to the Minister's officials for the timely way in which they have presented these documents and for the way in which they have set them out. They have been produced in a folder, in chronological order—something I have specifically asked for before—and they have even been flagged, so we have been very well treated and are all grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's giving way to me means that I shall not make a speech. If the Commission wishes to interest itself in such affairs rather than leaving them to member states, it is difficult to contemplate anything being left to member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting proposition. You, Mr. Howells, may not have realised that the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell)—a fine, decent and civilised man—is a less ardent federalist, as he revealed in that intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sexual harassment is a nauseating problem for many women, although my first experience of sexual harassment, many years ago, was the case of a young boy, a neighbour of mine, who left school with me at the age of 15. He obtained a job in a smokehouse at a fish processing plant. During the first two weeks of his employment there, a group of fishergirls poured kipper dye over a somewhat sensitive area of his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
body. Even now I can remember the shock and horror of the boy and his family at the appalling behaviour of those so-called ladies. I hasten to add that most fishergirls—my mother was one—are decent, fine and honourable women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In more recent times, only three weeks ago I spoke about that problem to the managing director of a company located in my constituency which employs scores of women constituents. That man, a Canadian employed by a large American company, was stunned when I asked him to produce a copy of his company's policy statement on the prevention, detection and elimination of sexual harassment. He had to concede that he had seen no policy document, but promised that within the next few weeks he would introduce a policy with its attendant procedures. I look forward to that because the company employs women on shift work. Some women—not only younger women—may have to face the advances of some wholly unappealing males. As in most shift work, there is often a diminution in supervision on some shifts, which must be taken into consideration when establishing procedures in such companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is common, especially among smaller firms. Other hon. Members have been keen today to mention ICI and IBM and their excellent procedures. I readily concur with those observations. IBM is the biggest employer in my constituency and few problems of that sort ever emerge from that company. However, small and medium-sized companies, with no policy, have in the past received little guidance, although I am pleased with the recent initiatives taken by the Employment Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in an intervention, there are education and training implications, especially for employers, but also for trade unions and employees. Millions of women employees in part-time and full-time employment are not members of trade unions and are thus denied the right that others take on comfortably of seeking advice from a trade union representative. Women in companies with no trade union organisation should be the centre of attention in the Employment Service's work in dealing with that pernicious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TUC defines sexual harassment as
	<br><blockquote><p>"repeated, unwanted verbal sexual advances, sexually explicit derogatory statements or sexually discriminating remarks which are offensive to the worker and which cause the worker to feel threatened, humiliated, patronised or harassed, or which interfere with the workers job performance, undermine job security or create a threatening or intimidating work environment."</p></blockquote>
That is pretty close to the Under-Secretary's definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some unions are ahead of others in dealing with the problem. The Banking, Insurance and Finance Union published a leaflet for all its members throughout England, Wales and Scotland. I mentioned this when I intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley). In one leaflet, the BIFU offers this advice:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If you are suffering from, worried about or dealing with a case of sexual harassment, feel free to contact any of the following counsellors.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>They do not have to be in your area, or work for your employer. Confidentiality is assured."</p></blockquote>
For example, the leaflet names Agnes Tolmie, who is an employee of the Royal Bank of Scotland in
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
West Nile street, Glasgow and Betty Wilson at the TSB in Glasgow. Members can telephone them from anywhere in Scotland if they do not wish to speak to a colleague in the branch where they suffer harassment. That is a fine union document. If the Minister's leaflets are of the same quality, I shall be the first to compliment him and his officials. Women members of that union tell me that they are pleased to have that support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, it has been agreed with the Clydesdale bank and, I believe, the Royal Bank of Scotland, that those organisations will employ counsellors who are out of line management, to express it that way. All the codes of practice that I have seen, including that excellent code of practice introduced by the iniquitous Industrial Relations Act 1971, have urged, in the establishment of grievance procedures, that the first contact should be a person's immediate superior or supervisor. The Minister has acknowledged the problem. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs Heal) said, in cases of sexual harassment the first contact might be the alleged perpetrator of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grievance procedures may need to be changed along the lines negotiated between the BIFU, the Clydesdale bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Incidentally, banks in Wales and Scotland have similar agreements with that union. It is a fine example to follow. Employers, trades unions and employees need to be aware of the redress of grievance that people can seek when bedevilled by this squalid problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I should be brief, Mr. Howells, and I do not want to ruin my reputation with my colleagues. I wish however, to comment briefly on subsidiarity, which the Minister mentioned. The Minister responded to one of his colleagues by saying that we may be dealing here with a borderline case vis-à-vis subsidiarity. In my view, it is a will-o'-the-wisp concept at present. We shall gain a clear idea of subsidiarity only when the European Court of Justice has pronounced judgment in several cases. In relation to declarations, recommendations or directives, I do not believe that English or Community law should be given primacy. In some respects, Scots law may be a much more effective tool to deal with problems relating to the dignity of men and women in the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should acknowledge that subsidiarity is an airy-fairy concept. No one can provide a clear definition of responsibility between areas of competence in the 12 national legislatures on the one hand and the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Court of Justice on the other. However, the European Court has taken on board the functions of an appeal court in relation to the English and Scottish legal systems and, indeed, the other 11 legal systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, what happens when an Islamic country enters the European Community? People may say that we are many years away from that eventuality, but accession of such a country could blow a hole into the whole concept of subsidiarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has provided a fair-minded assessment of the documents, and it is not before
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
time that we should tackle the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lewis Stevens 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aims and objectives of the recommendation are excellent. As I said earlier, I am pleased with the Government's approach. I am also pleased that the Commission has put forward not a directive but a recommended code of practice. Generally, such codes of practice are more practical, more workable and more flexible than direct laws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do want to whinge again about the Commission's issuance of recommendations and codes of practice. I merely say that although considerable funding is available to monitor what happens after a recommendation or directive has been introduced, relatively little analysis appears to be done throughout the Community prior to bringing codes of practice forward. Had the Commission taken a more in-depth look at circumstances within the EC, it could have provided a more detailed code of practice. We might also have had more statistical information on the variety of approaches that sovereign states could take in seeking to implement the recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A general view of a satisfactory objective is often taken, and an assessment is then made of how it could best be met; but time and again, not enough analysis is made before the event. Had greater analysis before the event been undertaken, a better and more practical code of practice could have been produced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and worthwhile debate. I have noticed some disagreement between hon. Members on the two sides of the Committee—not just a matter of differences in political perspective—about the nature and origins of sexual harassment. My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) saw the solution to the problem as one of growing out of something—a perspective that I tend to endorse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other side of the Committee, the hon. Members for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) and for Mid-Staffordshire (Mrs Heal) said that sexual harassment was rooted in power relations. The hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire developed the theme. She said that boys were brought up to be dominant and girls to be passive and that sexual harassment derived from the exercise of power of the male over the female. The influence on people growing up and the idea of dominance are both relevant perspectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I witnessed my first example of sexual harassment only the other day when I visited a large car plant. We went round the area on a golf trolley with a senior manager of the company, who was a woman. As we went round, wolf whistles were directed at her. I wondered what psychological phenomenon lay behind those wolf whistles. I do not know whether it was because the workers knew that she was a member of the senior management team, but the whistles seem to represent an assertion of inadequacy rather
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
than of power. That might be the deep psychological root of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire may be interested to see a review in the current issue of 	<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> of a book by Liam Hudson called "How Men Think". It interprets masculine behaviour and its roots and origins in a way that could shed light on the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that sexual harassment is a complex phenomenon. It has multiform origins, so it is difficult to deal with. How would management deal with the problem that I described in the car factory? It is not simply a question of the senior lady manager avoiding the inconvenience, but deeper, economic questions are at stake. For example, the factory might wish to introduce women into the work force. How would a work force that whistles at managers accept making motor cars alongside women workers? I asked the director of the company that question. He said that it was a difficult issue and that the culture of the workplace had been established for about 30 years. I suspect that it does not have the same problems as Nissan. We all know that the problems are deeply intractable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to pick up my hon. Friend's point, because in the debate we are not writing well-considered essays, but I do not think that the problem is deeply intractable. It may be pervasive, but most evidence shows that the problem can be eliminated by establishing an ethos, a structure and set procedures. It will not be eliminated everywhere in one go, but the problem is tractable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is a little more optimistic than I am. We may be dealing with the old Adam and perhaps the old Eve as well. Nevertheless, we should not shy away from tackling the problem. We all agree that we must attempt to deal with it, although we may disagree about our success rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stretford made a few teasing remarks about the debates between my hon. Friend's, but members of the Committee agree that issues of subsidiarity are important to us all. That was made clear by the remarks of the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman). This is not a Conservative party issue, but one that concerns all Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stretford talked about the EOC's suggestions for strengthening the law. I referred to that when I answered a question of the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire. The EOC has not made a formal proposal, but there is a reference to it in its paper, "Equality Agenda". The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 provides a means of redress, which is established in case law, and a more specific provision would not be helpful. It could lead to problems of definition and interpretation, and to the diversion of courts and tribunals from the straightforward principles that have already been established by case law. However, if the EOC wishes to press its views, it can do so and we shall consider them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to intervene because time is short, but I want the Minister to consider the case of Strathclyde regional council 	<i>v.</i> Porcelli, which fell foul of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. It had a tortuous process: the original tribunal ruled that the case did not fall under that Act. However, those who gave the ultimate decision were able to construct a convoluted case. The Minister should consider whether a judgment made on that basis should be universal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer and I would not give the Committee legal advice, but I suggest that the Minister should consider carefully whether he is right to say that the present law is adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer either. I shall consider what was said, but the reasoning behind the judges' conclusion at the tribunal is not as important as the conclusion itself. That is something that arises under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. We are in constant dialogue with the EOC about those and many other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow referred to access to tribunals in respect of unfair dismissal and the two-year period. The point was taken up by the hon. Member for Stretford. Wide issues are involved in unfair dismissal legislation. I cannot make promises, but I shall draw to the attention of my colleagues who deal with industrial relations the suggestions made by hon. Gentlemans. I am unsure about the practicality of exempting this area from the service qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted what was said about the role of confidantes or counsellors—people who are outside the hierarchical structure of an enterprise with whom these matters can be discussed. We shall consider that proposal when we draft the leaflet and frame our campaign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise to be brief. Can the Minister say when the leaflet will be circulated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to discuss the draft leaflet with members of my advisory committee in late January or early February and to launch it in early spring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham spoke some wise words in the debate. I mentioned his contribution to the analysis of the roots of the problem. He said that survey studies were needed, especially within the Department of Employment group, in which he was a Minister. His point was taken up by the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire. I undertake to investigate our current survey data and to determine what we might collect in future. We do not want to over-burden people or to incur substantial extra costs. We may well find out more by tailoring existing arrangements. I shall make inquiries and come back to my hon. Friend and the hon. Lady on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise a point that I should have made earlier. In suggesting that the Department of Employment family should carry out its own survey studies, I did not intend to imply that
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
the situation was worse there than elsewhere; it is probably better. However, it would carry more credibility with other organisations that should be doing the same thing if the exercise were carried out in that Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend has said that about the Department of Employment. It is a good Department and is more liable to be aware of these issues than most other Departments or organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) got into his killjoy mode, to put it teasingly. I sympathise with his view. I thought that his speech was powerful in analysis and expression. He doubted the appropriateness of Community action in this area, and he quoted back to me my statement that this was a borderline case. I must say that, although the Commission may have taken up the matter, it originated not in a Commission initiative but in a presidency initiative. Some hon. Members are becoming alert to the extent to which the six-monthly rotation of the presidency is an incentive for incumbents to scratch about for ideas so that they can say that they have left their personal stamp during their tenure. I do not wish to be uncharitable to our Irish friends as I was not around at the time, but it is possible that that may have been one of the reasons why they decided to "do something about women". I have been in Council circles enough to know that that is often how matters develop. It is one of the inconveniences of the presidential rotation but is also a strength in that it encourages a constant fresh impetus in the Community. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding said, that may not always be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where sexual harassment falls within the equal treatment directive, the legal structure is already in place. If there were further proposals for a directive, the Commission would have to justify them by reference to the provisions of the treaty. The Government believe that member states should implement policy individually. One of the achievements of Maastricht, which we could pray in aid if that were ever to become a problem, is the formula on subsidiarity that I have already quoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of the Department, I am grateful for the thanks expressed by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) for the timely and expert preparation of the documents. I shall draw the attention of those responsible, some of whom are in the Room, to the hon. Gentleman's words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow said about Scots law. I am not a lawyer and know little about Scots law, but it seems to me that interesting issues were raised when the hon. Gentleman talked about the Islamic perspective, although I am not sure that a person of the Islamic faith would agree with his understanding of Islamic teaching about the relationship between the sexes. The dignity of the person is a concept that exists in the Roman law order of the continent. Perhaps that concept could be picked up in Scots law, with its particular Roman civil tradition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
It is a more difficult concept to admit in common law, but that shows the difficulty of translating a European enactment into the legal language of each member state. My hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Stevens) said that the Commission might have produced more detailed and comprehensive proposals if the facts had been subject to greater analysis. However, I am not sure that more detailed proposals are what is needed. I think that a level of generality is necessary to safeguard the diversity of possible approaches to the problem in the Community. In a sense, the more detailed a proposal, the more prescriptive it is. That is the dilemma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow also made an important point about companies that do not have policies in this matter. I confess that I used to be sceptical about the subject, somewhat in the spirit of my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding, until I found myself at a function sitting next to a senior manager of a chain of hotels. I asked him in conversation for his thoughts on the matter, as I had been talking about it that morning. He said that, as it happened, that very morning he had had to deal with his first such case in 18 years with the company. It involved an incident in the kitchens of one of the hotel chain's provincial properties and I found out that it had caused great perplexity. The company's managers did not know how to deal with it at local or national level. They did not know what the law was and had no procedures—it was a muddle. My interlocutor said that business would be pleased to have greater clarity and some assistance in formulating policies. They want to do that and are aware of the problem but have not tackled it. Our campaign will seek to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that sexual harassment at work is a serious problem for many working women. It is unpleasant and can become a dominating aspect of their working lives. But it is not unheard of for men to suffer sexual harassment. Sexual harassment can adversely affect people's health, confidence and work
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
performance. It can produce anxiety, stress, sickness and can lead to employees taking time off work or resigning. The hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Ms Heal) was right to emphasise the impact that it can have on the profitability and economic efficiency of businesses through the reduction of employees' productivity. Sexual harassment is unacceptable on economic and moral grounds. We are committed to encouraging the development of measures that will help create a working environment that is free from unwanted sexual conduct, which affects the dignity of men and women at work, and from victimisation of complainants. The Community has done a worthwhile job by raising awareness in member states. The Equal Opportunities Commission in Britain has done much useful work—its general code of practice is a helpful document. We have discussed the way that the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 can operate with the Equal Opportunities Commission code of conduct in cases before industrial tribunals. The Government intend to play a full role in reinforcing that message. I hope that our leaflet and the campaign based on it will be seen as a practical and sensible contribution. Again, we can strike a happy note of agreement in the Committee by saying that only through the commitment and co-operation of employers and employees can sexual harassment at work be tackled and, in due course, eradicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
