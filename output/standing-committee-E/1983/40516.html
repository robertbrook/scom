	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Energy (Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 9706/82, 8024/83, 8296/83, 4987/83, 7804/83, 8925/83, 9865/83, 8110/83, 8051/83 and 7809/83; and fully supports appropriate cost-effective measures that will help to minimise the Community's dependence on imported oil.</p></blockquote>
I begin by apologising to the Committee for the mountain of documents before us, but I hope that the Committee will appreciate that this is the first debate that we have had on these matters for a long time and that the documents cover a considerable period. The Scrutiny Committee examined them and rightly decided that they were appropriate for debate. The time is also appropriate for debate because they have been under discussion in the Council of Energy Ministers a number of times, and, on some of the issues, the discussion which has been general so far may be beginning to sharpen up. As I represent the United Kingdom at the Council of Energy Ministers, I should appreciate the views of the Committee about the discussions that I have had at the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motion before us covers a fundamental aspect of the Community's approach to energy, which is to minimise dependence on imported oil. That has been a priority since the first oil shock in 1973 and is enshrined in the Community's energy objectives up to 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents before us are comprehensive in their coverage of energy issues, with the exception, perhaps, of nuclear power. But that issue will be subject to a separate debate if the recommendations of the Scrutiny Committee are implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the main document, 7809/83, entitled "Energy and Energy Research in the Community: a five year programme of action and its financing". It sets out the overall scene and summarises the achievements of the Community since agreeing the 1990 objectives in June 1980. It also describes radical changes in the world oil market since then and urges the Community not to fall into the trap of allowing a softening market to throw Governments, industries and energy consumers off a prudent course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, and all member states, had little difficulty in endorsing that premise in principle. Even now, less than a year since the Commission produced its paper, changing events prove the fallacy of expecting certainty in energy supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The achievement and maintenance of energy self-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
sufficiency must continue to be a very high priority, and the paper quite rightly warns that dangers lie in a temptation not to sustain effort when there is no short-term stimulus to do so. The relative glut of oil that we have now must not lead to a failure to take sensible decisions about new investment. Our security of supply up to the year 2000 and beyond depends upon a variety of sources of energy. We must focus on developing the alternatives, such as wind, tidal, biomass, and so on. But in the foreseeable future the major contribution to energy demand will continue to be met from traditional sources: the economic production of coal, oil and natural gas and the generation of electricity—with due regard to safety and environmental factors—from coal and nuclear-fired stations. In addition to investment in production, we must continue to encourage energy consumers to invest in energy saving and the more rational use of energy. It is important that the energy industries continue to give the right pricing indications to consumers if we are to have the rational use of energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, as the paper acknowledges, energy is only one factor of production which member states and the Community as a whole must take into account. Although we need to ensure that the situation in respect of energy is as stable as possible, we cannot accept that at any price. We must set overall objectives and then decide where our priorities lie within those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paper 7809/83 offers four guidelines which the Government endorse. First, it requires Community programmes to take into account programmes and actions within individual member states and avoid duplication and waste of effort—for example, in research, development and demonstration. Secondly, it requires the Community to provide a framework for the economic supply and consumption of energy. Thirdly, it requires the Community to have a continuing interest in energy expenditure. Fourthly, it requires the Community to avoid rigidity in its programmes and policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper goes on to describe a programme of action including a number of initiatives which are already under way in the Community such as work on solid fuels, energy demonstration projects, non-nuclear research and development projects—about which we have documents before us today—and areas which are not yet the object of Community action, such as the integration of electricity networks, exploration for hydrocarbons, and greater flexibility of the gas supply system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that programme is pursued for five years, the Commission assesses that it will cost some 2 billion écu at 1983 prices. That is a substantial sum and, if agreed, would be a radical departure in terms of Community expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing the proposal the Council agreed that it had been useful to explore energy throughout the Community in this broad-brush fashion and to consider all the possibilities for action. The Government accept the need to avoid waste and duplication—a point that was originally raised at Question Time in the House—and to ensure that we adopt a cost-effective approach in the face of public expenditure constraints in all member states. Therefore, it is important to select priorities, especially those areas which are ripe for action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two areas in which the United Kingdom has sought to make progress are energy demonstration,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1983-1984V012P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
which is covered by document 8110/83, and solid fuels, which is covered by documents 4987/83, 7804/83, 8925/83 and 9865/83. The Foreign Affairs Council agreed in March that expenditure of 265 million écu in 1983–86 should be allowed in support of the third Community energy demonstration project programme. Although that total sum has been agreed, the exact allocation of that funding between the various areas of work that might benefit—for example, coal gasification and liquefaction, energy saving, biomass, wind and solar power—remains to be finalised. Questions of cost-effectiveness will obviously affect the outcome of any discussions on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister again tell the Committee the agreed figures for the demonstration project?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amount agreed at the Foreign Affairs Council was 265 million écu but, as I said, the allocation of that figure is still open for discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's document covers a very thorough appraisal of the state of solid fuels; of coal, which is of primary interest to the United Kingdom, peat, or turf as it is called in the Republic of Ireland, and lignite, which is of special interest to Greece. Every aspect must be considered: investment in the modernisation and restructuring of economic production in coal use, environmental safeguards and research and development into coal technology. The Commission has argued for expenditure on such items of more than 1,800 million écu over a five-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that Community support for investment in the economic production of solid fuels in the United Kingdom should be a high priority for concerted Community action. We believe that it will be a cost-effective investment in an indigenous Community energy resource which contributes to the energy self-sufficiency of the Community to the end of this century and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall continue to press hard in the Energy Council for agreement to the Commission's proposals which we think would make a useful foundation stone upon which to build up further Community energy initiatives. I am disappointed that the agreement has so far not been reached, and I have to tell the Committee that we are not even close to agreement about the initiative on solid fuels. The matter is one of priority, and I shall continue to press it very strongly in meetings of the Energy Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My apologies for interrupting, but I hope that it will benefit the Committee. The Minister said that the Government threw their full weight behind the Commission's proposal. Is that the draft regulation in document 8925/83 which contains the list of features of the proposed regulation? The Committee would like to know if that is what the Government are backing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not yet reached the stage of deciding on the details of the solid fuels initiative, and the individual items within it. We want to make sure that the solid fuels proposals are considered and not rejected out of hand, as some countries
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
might wish. I hope that we make progress in the Council of Ministers in getting down to the details of the initiative and I should welcome any views that members of the Committee might have, because no decision has been reached. That is the advantage of our debate, and I shall certainly take into account the views of hon. Members on individual aspects of the matter in drawing up lists of priorities within any solid fuels initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council has been keen that the Community's energy expenditure should be undertaken with full regard to cost-effectiveness. We are not prepared to approve any measure simply for the sake of having it. That would be foolish and short sighted. I have stressed already the role that the Government and the Community see for energy saving as part of the Community's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency. However, it is important that the general desirability of that objective should not lead us to invest unwisely in any specific aspect of the programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Documents 9706/82, 8024/83 and 8296/83 deal with the Commission's proposal for the rational use of energy. I believe that the Committee is aware, from its knowledge of the Community's work on energy, that the Community and the Government place a high priority on energy saving. None the less, the Council so far has been reluctant to support this proposal, and it might help if I explained why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that it was proposed to make a sum of 150 million écu available over five years for interest rate subvention of commercial loans to invest in conventional energy-saving equipment. It was not clear, taking into account all the financial aspects, that the proposal would be any more attractive to consumers than normal commercial loans already available. All in all, member states felt that to approve this idea would not further the Community's energy-saving objectives, nor would it use the Community's financial resources cost-effectively. It seems likely that at the next Energy Council meeting the Commission may ask the Council to record that agreement could be reached on this draft regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final document to which I wish to refer, which is currently before the Council, is the programme of expenditure on non-nuclear research and development. Document 8051/83 describes a proposal for expenditure of up to 379 million écu on research into the development of renewable sources and the rational use of energy. Those are important items in striving for energy self-sufficiency. However, when the Research Council looks at the proposal later this year, I hope that it will temper its desire to make progress with due concern for realistic and cost-effective expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Committee for subjecting it to such a mass of documentation and for speaking at speed on those items. I sought only to summarise the main issues involved. None the less, I hope that I have managed to concentrate on the main issues and focus on those areas which I, as the Minister representing the Government at the Council of Ministers, think are important. I welcome the Committee's views on the priorities that I spelt out and other matters. I know that hon. Members will have gone through the documents in considerable detail and with care. I appreciate that there are a number of important points that I have not managed to cover this morning. I shall listen with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1983-1984V012P0I0644">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
care to matters raised by hon. Members which I have not mentioned and bear such comments carefully in mind when they are considered in the Council of Ministers. I have tried to clarify some of the issues before us and I thank the Committee for its patience in listening to me. I commend the documents to hon. Members and ask them to support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.49 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like to admit a sense of inferiority in the presence of a Minister, but I shall have to confess to it because we know that the right hon. Gentleman has had long experience of handling EEC documents. He paddled his way through a common fisheries policy and ploughed his way through a common agricultural policy in his previous role; now he has turned his attention to a common energy policy. I hope that British coal does not go the way that the herring went and that we can concentrate on the issues raised because some very important issues are buried in these documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have split the documents into two. There is a group which deals with the tortuous courses that have been followed by the Commission and various energy councils to try to find a set of practical proposals to promote and develop the coal industry within the EEC since 1974, and, secondly, there is a closely allied set of documents which deals with research, development and demonstration projects. Because we can lose wood for trees—or trees for wood—among the documents, I wish to draw out and underline the context of the ideas and arguments and some of the principles that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The context of the documents is one that is rightly suggested in the motion. There is a justifiably passionate desire, after the oil price increases in 1973-74 and the problems that arose in a Europe short of oil, to minimise the Community's dependence on imported oil. I regret that the motion does not also include a major argument that arose, which was a generally accepted principle. We should not only try to minimise the Community's dependence on imported oil but should positively promote and develop indigenous resources within the EEC. The centrepiece of that alternative strategy was the development of coal production and its use. I do not believe that I would stretch the consensus in the Committee by adding that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the documents reflect an attempt to grope towards a series of practical solutions and proposals to achieve that aim. After 1974 we became over-dependent on imported oil and rediscovered the value of coal. We had forgotten how precious that indigenous fuel was. Successive Governments ran the industry down because it was felt that coal had no real value when oil was being bought for cents a barrel. Suddenly, overnight, assumptions of energy policy were changed and we rediscovered the value and importance of coal, which is one of the largest indigenous resources in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1974, there have been Summit meetings in Paris, Tokyo and Venice, and a variety of informal meetings in Copenhagen that are referred to in the documents. The principle and the context of those meetings related to the way in which our coal industry could be promoted and developed as a major alter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
native source of imported energy resources. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to consider what has happened since 1974. Given the rhetoric at Summit meetings on those issues, what has happened?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some key decisions were made in 1974. Imported energy was supposed to be cut within the EEC from 63 per cent to 40 per cent. Oil was to be cut from 61 per cent to 40 per cent; solid fuels were to be cut from 23 per cent to 17 per cent, but increasing in total overall amounts. Natural gas was to be increased from 11 per cent to 23 per cent; and nuclear was to rise from 1.5 per cent to 16 per cent in the strategy that was laid down in the mid 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been reviews of those objectives—there was one in 1978 and another in 1979. I hate to add to the Committee's burden, but it is sad that we have not included another important document, which was published in June 1983. I call it Com 83/305 (Final) but I do not know what other numbers are given to it. It reviews the progress of those objectives during the four years 1979–83.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document demonstrates that there has been tremendous achievement in the cut in dependence on imported oil, mainly because consumption has fallen dramatically. The recession has been the most effective cause of conservation of resources and cuts in imported oil. One of the more significant changes is that one member of the Community became a major oil exporter during that period—the United Kingdom. Around 26 to 30 million tonnes of United Kingdom oil now goes to the EC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures showing that the EC and Europe have become less dependent on imported oil have resulted from two factors. The first is that consumption has fallen dramatically as a result partly of the recession and partly of conservation. The second factor is the amount of oil that the United Kingdom has exported to the EC since 1979. As the document illustrates, if one takes out the United Kingdom contribution of oil, it is still frightening how dependent the EC is on oil. The average is 46 per cent dependence, which is much higher than some of the objectives. Although the figures have dropped satisfactorily overall and we seem to be on target, in many cases—especially that of the Italians, who are 67 per cent dependent on imported oil —we must temper our sense of achievement by checking and cautiously assessing the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many other interesting factors demonstrate whether we have come close to those targets, including what happened to coal in 1974–84. It is commonly agreed that during that 10-year period coal was to be the centrepiece of an alternative strategy. But what happened to production, consumption and importation of coal in Europe?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to dig out the figures on that and I shall be grateful if the Minister will confirm whether my figures are right. They are a salutary reminder of systems, organisations, and Governments, which set objectives. We can then see whether those objectives have been met during a 10-year period. Coal was to be the centrepiece of that alternative strategy for removing our dependence on imported energy sources but the figures do not give any comfort. First, let us take EC production in 1974. The figures are slightly misleading because there was a strike in the United Kingdom at the tail-end of 1974. Let us take 1974–75. Coal production in the EC was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1983-1984V012P0I0645">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
245 to 255 million tonnes. In 1983 it was 229 million tonnes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the strategies that we were supposed to adopt was the development of our indigenous coal industry as an alternative major fuel source. However, we failed because there was a significant fall in production of coal during the 10-year period 1974–1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, consumption has fallen as a result of the recession. Coal has been the chief victim of the recession and of Government policies generally. An estimated figure for consumption within the EC is around 280 million tonnes compared with a figure in 1973–74 of 296 million, nearly 300 million tonnes. Therefore we are producing less and consuming less of our major indigenous fuel as a result of a variety of factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite what was said in Paris in December 1974 and in Venice and Tokyo about the role of coal—the documents are an intrinsic part of the practical attempts to carry forward the issue—in that 10-year period, almost the opposite has happened in respect of the concepts, notions, thoughts and ideas of Governments and Ministers. In EC terms, there has been a large and significant increase in imported coal. Coal was supposed to be the alternative indigenous fuel to counter imported energy resources. Indeed, there is a touch of irony because indigenous fuel has become a major source of imports into the EC. The figure has risen from 48 million tonnes to well over 70 million tonnes in the early 1980s, and now stands at about 60 million tonnes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever conclusions are drawn—I shall make some shortly—about the thinking on how to identify and handle the problems thrown up a decade ago as a result of the oil price hype and the oil revolution which occurred in 1973–74, one major objective certainly does not appear to be on course—namely, the dominant role to be played by coal in EC terms. Consumption has fallen and production has decreased dramatically. Throughout the EC there is talk of major cuts in coal capacity. It is curious that 10 years after the EC started on the policy of encouraging that major source of fuel this country is less dependent on oil imports but is becoming increasingly reliant on coal imports to meet demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point is underlined in a report from another place on EC strategy and objectives, which came out this week. It is interesting, although some of the conclusions are bizarre. However, the facts and statistics are informative. There is an incredible statistic for the year 2000—I do not really believe in such predictions, and I do not suppose that anyone else here does either —which suggests that by then the EC will require 250 million tonnes of imported coal. It should be remembered that at present the world trading market in coal is only about 200 million tonnes. Rightly, the report casts some scepticism about the possibility of such an amount being delivered and the desirability of the EC being dependent on it. The context of these documents and the issues raised by them in relation to the coal industry must be seen in the light of what I have tried to describe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might useful for me to declare where I stand on the matter: I do not believe in a common energy policy for the EC. I do not think that is obtainable or necessarily desirable. It is not possible to nudge, push or cajole nine or 10 countries with completely different existing and historical patterns of economic and energy develop-
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
ment into a common energy view. There is a disparate range of requirements—that is why so little has come our of all the discussions and documents on the issues—and little in common, in energy terms, between, say, Italy and the United Kingdom. The Italians need to import most of their energy resources. No doubt their greatest wish is to do so as cheaply as possible, and from whatever source. But it is not necessarily in the interest of other countries with large coal industries to promote a totally free market in imported coal for the EC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is energy rich with millions of tonnes of oil equivalent and last year had an energy surplus, with about 60 million tonnes of oil equivalent. That is vastly different from the problems facing the Italians, the Irish or, in certain respects, the French. Any notion that we should try to achieve a common energy EC policy will founder. The danger, if we try for that, is that we shall end up with another CAP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a coalmining community and we have looked enviously at the CAP. Why not have mountains of coal financed from sources other than ourselves to maintain production? Why not have a common coal policy financed in the same way that we finance massive agricultural surpluses, with large protectionist barriers to make sure that some nations such as ourselves cannot buy cheaper food from certain markets because of the necessity to buy European? If such a policy were offered, I would be tempted in a traditional, old-fashioned way to take what was on offer and carry on producing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that it is not the Government's aim to create a common energy or coal policy on the lines of the CAP. I do not believe that there is either the will or the community of interest to create a common energy policy. However, we can try to find, in practical and simple ways, some common objectives and then see whether we can produce practical measures to achieve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the objectives in the documents under discussion are perfectly unobjectionable and non-controversial, and it is surprising how little progress has been made. The concept of the demonstration projects —of trying to get some form of co-ordination in research and development programmes—among the Governments of the Nine is eminently sensible and practical. It is tragic that little progress has been made even on that rather minimalist idea or position. Although I was interested that in March the Foreign Affairs Council endorsed a budget for demonstration projects, I have a horrible feeling that this time next year we shall still be arguing over which project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain obviously has a major interest and the Minister wants liquefaction and gasification, which are matters of considerable importance to us. Research has been quite highly developed and any backing and support that can be given through a common research and development policy as described in some of the documents would be invaluable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister appeared to be pouring cold water on hopes of any real progress in the rational use of energy. He picked out only one suggestion from the documents. There are questions of boiler conversion and combined heat and power. I shall be grateful if the Minister will tell us in his reply how far we have progressed towards achieving something, agreeing something and spending
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1983-1984V012P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
something in practical terms arising from the ideas contained in the documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sum total of his speech, despite the invaluable information that it contained—and this is not a criticism—is that almost nothing has reached the point of agreement arising from this range of documents. In particular, there has been no agreement on the central set of documents in regard to the working party's proposal for solid fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's proposals are based upon what appears to be a series of reasonable suggestions—that Community aid should be given for investment in modernisation and the development of new solid fuel production; that there should be a transfer of funds from the EC budget to the ECSC budget to provide moneys for rationalisation of the coal industry; that there should be Community aid to encourage a reduction in the current high levels of producers' coal stocks and that there should be revised arrangements for providing aid for Community coking coal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was rather coy in not giving more details. I believe that the Committee can bear—certainly, I can —much more detailed discussion of where the Government stand on these issues and how far the Community has proceeded on them. One reason why I intervened was that the Community proceeded as far as to produce a draft regulation. I shall not plough through it; as always, a nice explanatory memorandum has been provided by the Department of Energy and it gives the skeleton of the draft regulation. For the benefit of the Committee, the document to which I refer is dated 3 October 1983 and it relates to EC document No. 8925/83.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the initial attraction to the United Kingdom of seeking to go down this road and trying to get firm agreement on the proposals. We have the largest coal industry in the EC and a large investment programme. However, we shall need an even larger one for the future development of our major indigenous resource of coal. If we can defray a percentage—for example, 25 per cent of the cost of that investment against EC funds—we shall be assisted in the budgetary argument, which I believe is referred to in the documents. We would get some money from other sources to finance investment in the coal industry. None of us should be opposed to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to be very careful—I wish to discover where the Government stand on this issue—about the conditions laid down in the draft regulation for making applications for such money. I believe that the Committee would find it worth while to study the explanatory memorandum dated 3 October 1983, which is why I wished to draw attention to it. It says that investment aid of the sort proposed
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be conditional on the coal undertaking having obtained Commission approval for a modernisation and restructuring programme covering 1984 to 1988 for their operations".</p></blockquote>
That suggests that the Government and the National Coal Board would have to submit a major restructuring programme to the Commission before we could qualify for the money. Will the Government acknowledge that they would be prepared to do that to obtain the 25 per cent investment, because we would then go down the Davignon road that we travelled in regard to the steel industry when we made such commitments? I believe
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
that there is extensive cross-party feeling that the sort of structural changes that we then undertook were not matched by others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we want to pursue, adopt and endorse, or become imprisoned in a Davignon-style policy for restructuring the coal industry, whereby the Commission starts to set specific national targets for production and capacity in the way that was done in the case of steel? My concern was aroused when I discovered that the letter accompanying the documents was signed by none other than Davignon. When Davignon signs documents, one must pay attention because we have experience of Vice-President's Davignon's influence on such matters. I refer to document COM(83) 447 dated 17 August 1983. It contains such major statements as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the structural mismatch of the Community coal supply position with respect to demand, a mismatch which is explained largely by the fact that Community coal is not competitive with imported coal. This makes it necessary to act on a broad front to modify the level of production".</p></blockquote>
—in the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, we would be going down a path similar to that which we took on steel. The Government may wish to support that. They may believe that that is the way to proceed because it is the fundamental condition of our being given any of the investment aid mentioned in the draft regulations, one of the fundamental documents being considered by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the only condition. Let the Committee read on to the next condition imposed for attracting investment aid. The memorandum dated 3 October 1983 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for hard coal, only projects expected to satisfy a defined productivity criterion will be eligible for aid".</p></blockquote>
Whose productivity criterion? What is it? Who laid it down? The Commission? Nation states? Who will establish this criterion and these conditions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The memorandum also states that in relation to reduction of coal stocks
	<br><blockquote><p>"aid will be conditional on the undertaking having first received aid for investment".</p></blockquote>
The restructuring programme, in turn, must be approved by the Commission. The document raises serious issues of national sovereignty and control over our decisions about a major industry, as happened when the restructuring of steel took place in the EEC. They are major issues which transcend the odd bit of aid and practical assistance to develop the purchase and sale of a few million tonnes of coal. Something much more fundamental is at stake here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was privileged to visit Germany a few months ago because I wished to try to understand some of these issues. I went to the Ministry of the Economy—Germany does not have a Ministry of Energy. The head of one of its sections, whom the Minister may know because he has been around a long time, is Mr. Engelmann. He has a magnificent and historic view of the coal industry in Germany. He made it clear that the Germans are unwilling to abrogate any form of control or sovereignty of decisions about the restructuring of the German coal industry. Elaborate discussions took place; I was there in the middle of them. I gained the impression that any obstacle to this type of document would come from the Germans if not from us. I shall be grateful if the Minister, who has much experience of attending these Energy Councils, can confirm that my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1983-1984V012P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
impressions are correct. I felt that under no circumstances would the Germans allow the EEC to crawl over the German coal industry. They regard it as of such national strategic importance, historically, politically and socially, in all areas and with all the problems, that they have no intention of allowing effective control over the restructuring of the industry to be taken away or partially transferred from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I exaggerate. That is implied by the condition laid down in the draft regulations to enable us to collect 25 per cent grant of one kind or another from the EEC to invest in our coal industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents are designed to try to promote the use of coal. The context that seemed to be missing from the Minister's speech was, what sort of coal industry do we want? He will have another chance to reply. This is an continuing discussions, and I accept that this is merely one stage in a long process. But the Committee needs to consider that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the consensus in the 1970s in Paris, Tokyo and Venice was that Europe should have a large-capacity indigenous coal industry to develop alternative uses for coal not only for power stations but right across the board. Some of the documents reflect that. Yet the worrying sign is that EEC capacity will fall sharply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be grateful if the Minister—we amateurs tend to be more literate than numerate and experience difficulty in getting and understanding figures—will confirm the figures that I have on the EEC coal capacity as being roughly right and that the slight projection forward I shall make is within reason and accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I work on the figures that the West German coal industry capacity is about 96 million tonnes, the French about 17 million tonnes, the Belgian about 6.4 million tonnes, the Irish about 70,000 tonnes and the United Kingdom 121 million tonnes. These are the figures given in the European statistical handbook and ours obviously include 15 million tonnes of opencast, as deep-mined coal was 105 million tonnes. I can update that figure because in 1983–84 we had 101 million tonnes of deep-mined capacity, and one aspect of the MacGregor plan was that it would reduce to 97 million tonnes. Therefore, if we add 97 and 15, the United Kingdom coal capacity will be 112 million tonnes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those figures are right, there will be a large shortfall between known need for coal in the projection forward to 1990 within the EEC and the capacity within the EEC to produce it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are documents here, but I cannot make head nor tail of the figures. However, I shall refer to a document dated 9 June 1983, and to the table in annex 1, which gives some projection forward. Unfortunately, that document is not included among those that we are discussing, but it should have been, and I strongly recommend everyone to get a copy as it is a most interesting document on the subject of projections. It is the only document that I have found which seeks to project forward for energy consumption in the EEC and its various sources and supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 12 of the document states that the United Kingdom has submitted national returns to make up these figures. Will the Minister make available to the Committee details of that national return? Those figures are all based on national returns. What were the United Kingdom's projections forward up to 1990 for coal
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
production, solid fuel production and so on which make up the major annex attached to this document? I think we ought to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Minister on the meticulous detail with which he has tried to achieve something sensible and practical to aid and support the coal industry during the Energy Council meetings. But, as yet, nothing has been delivered. The real irony is that 10 years afterwards we could be setting a course in which we may become less dependent on imported oil and hugely more dependent on imported coal. I cannot believe that that was the objective or desire of the great leaders who met at the Summits in Paris, Tokyo and Venice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that that will happen unless we as a nation, we as a Committee and the EEC recognise the value and importance of maintaining a high-capacity coal industry for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.24 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Redmond	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Don Valley) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he was prepared to consider any suggestions from the Committee. The only worthwhile suggestion that I can make is to offer him a box of matches. Having taken the documents home and proceeded to wade through them, I was slightly more confused at the end than when I started reading them. There are numerous policies contained within the documents. One looks at a policy and says, "Great, that's the way we ought to go", but, on turning over the page, one finds a contradictory policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rushed through the documents this morning. I wish that he had taken his time and told us clearly how Britain stood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to say that we want a viable coal industry that can make a valuable contribution and then proceed to take steps which contradict that. I wonder exactly what sort of Community spirit there is in that section of the EC when each country seems to pursue policies beneficial to itself and then participates in a Community debate that produces numerous policies meaning everything and nowt at the end of the day. If the Minister is meeting his colleagues again in July, perhaps that is when the EC members should get together and produce a policy that is beneficial to the Community, because at present it appears to be pursuing policies that benefit our competitors elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents mention four countries basically from whom we import coal. Poland is one yet the crises in Poland over the past few years and the general hostility of the Prime Minister towards the eastern bloc makes me question whether we should place any reliance on that source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the South African content, coal production creates a great deal of work for its black workers, who provide cheap labour, but, bearing in mind what is happening on that continent, one questions whether we should place any reliance there for our long-term strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we have our friends across the Atlantic—the Americans. That is all right—we can rely on them if we are prepared to pay the bucks for the coal at the end of the day. While there is a glut, we have a source of cheap imported coal, but if the bolt fell on coal as it did on oil in the early 1970s, the price of coal would go skyhigh and, clearly that would affect the balance of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1983-1984V012P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
payments. We seem to be exporting very little in terms of manufactures, and so on, but the balance of payments is extremely crucial to our future welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister can tell us what line he intends to pursue on the nuclear aspect when he goes to the EC. France is pursuing a nuclear policy and is running down her coal industry. Our present Government are pursuing a nuclear policy, and what is again happening clearly indicates a rundown of our coal industry, yet various reports give conflicting figures about our energy requirements in the 1990s and at the turn of the century. Can the Minister say what tonnages he sees Britain's coal industry producing? The matter is crucial, because we cannot possibly run down our coal industry and then turn on the tap and expect to produce coal from under ground within a couple of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about the security of supplies from the four countries. I would have faith in Australia only. When we consider our attitude to Australian products such as lamb and how we have turned the common agricultural policy against them, we wonder whether the Australians will be as loyal to us in the future as in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us the line that he will take towards balances held in the various countries? The documents are a little unclear about what should be held in stocks as a buffer. One refers to approximately one month, and others to 40 and 60-odd days. There is a penalty system that will penalise the benefit that a country will accrue from holding good balances as a buffer against a demand on the world markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have much sympathy for the Irish, and we should be producing coal to export to Ireland—and also to Greece. If there is a common boundary that stretches around the countries, perhaps we should export coal to those countries, as France exports wine to Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my understanding of the EC. But there is a conflict. We must produce enough to have a buffer but at the same time we must allow imports to keep the internal price down and there must be an internal buffer to keep the external price down. That is fine in theory, but it does not appear to work. Will the Minister say how rebates from the EC to the United Kingdom will be used? Will industry benefit or suffer? Will the Government benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to district heating, which was mentioned briefly. Will the Government take advantage of coal and give local authorities a good rebate if they install district heating? My authority in Doncaster has a number of district heating schemes that are extremely good and are praised by tenants, many of whom are old-age pensioners. It is important for them to have a source of heating that is not metered so that there is no danger that they will try to ration it and perhaps develop hypothermia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister's views on the social consequences of the document. I refer to those areas that are being run down because of coal exhaustion. An area that is being run down for a variety of reasons can receive money from one source only—either the EC or the Government, but not both. As I understand it, the Government knock off all that is received from the EC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no long-term planning that I can see in that respect. The Mexborough area was dependent on the coal industry some years ago and now suffers a high
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
rate of unemployment of about 23 per cent because of the cuts in manpower and pits. However, subsidies to cushion the recession do not appear to have come from the EC. If such subsidies were received in future, would the Minister and his colleagues argue that those EC grants should be the cream on the cake and not part of the overall money that is poured into the industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister returns in July, I hope that he will have a clear understanding of the direction in which we wish to go. If the EC decides against nuclear production, I wonder whether the United Kingdom will abide by that decision. I hope the Minister will give some clarification of clear-cut policies that we can understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee only briefly. As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) said, it is difficult to foresee a common energy policy in the same way that we have come to grips with the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy, mainly due to the wide variety of supply and needs in member states. However, perhaps there is no harm in having diversity of energy supply in the EC because putting all its eggs in one basket or two is a shortsighted policy. There is much to be said for diversity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years to come it appears that decisions relating to energy and those which have the most crucial effect on the energy industries of member states will be taken by the member states themselves. Nevertheless, I believe that the Community can play a useful role—and has been doing so—in co-ordinaring energy policies of member states and setting targets, some of which we have discussed today. Some of the documents relate to increasing co-ordination between member states on research and development in various fields of energy, especially in developing new energy sources. It is recognised that alternative energy sources have a role to play and it would be a waste of resources if each member state tried to develop its own wind power, tidal power and solar energy in total isolation. An increasing role can be played in harmonising research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this country we welcome especially the JET project, which I imagine will be discussed further. There is a committee to discuss nuclear aspects of the Community's energy policy and the development of alternative sources of energy and energy efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have at my finger tips the number of the paper, but the Minister referred to the Commission's proposals for energy efficiency and said that the proposals had not found support in the Council of Ministers because there was no obvious advantage in the proposals put forward for a Community loan scheme over commercial loans that would be available to those wishing to invest in energy-efficiency projects. I wonder whether the Government have taken any further initiative—bearing in mind that that Commission proposal has appeared to reach a dead end—in trying to come up with a different scheme which might have more appeal for the industrial sector in encouraging energy efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the steps taken by the Secretary of State for Energy and his Ministers to promote energy efficiency here. But sometimes I wonder whether it is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1983-1984V012P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
policy only of the Department of Energy; it does not always seem to have the support of other Departments that I would wish. For example, there is the proposed extension of VAT to building alterations, which may discourage people who wish to invest in energy-saving alterations to their homes, offices or other buildings. None the less, we welcome what the Department of Energy has done, and we wonder whether the Government could take the initiative on a European scale to support those wishing to invest in energy-efficiency projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue which has taken up a considerable amount of the Committee's time, and about which I wish to speak only briefly, is coal. As with the whole common energy policy, it is clear that the future of the coal industry will depend a great deal more on national Government strategy than on Community policy in the years to come. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney spoke of the concern about the increase in coal imports into the Community in recent years. Between 1978 and 1982 it was 53 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The increase was 53 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We should not underestimate the importance of security of supply. Those countries from which we import coal generally have more stable political regimes than those from which oil is bought; and that might lull us into a false sense of security. There is much to be said for increasing our self-sufficiency in coal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the hon. Gentleman's concern, in the light of the quote from document 8925/83, about the mismatch between coal demand and supply. The fear is that that will lead to a strict economic approach to the future of the coal industry within the Community. Of course, coal mining is an extractive industry; what is taken out of the ground is not replaced, and there comes a time when pits are no longer viable. Inevitably there is disagreement about the stage when that is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go too deeply into the issues in the current mining dispute, but it appears that there is ample room for discussion about what constitutes an uneconomic pit and which pits should be kept open. For the two parties involved to have taken up apparently intransigent positions seems amazing in the circumstances. None the less, we foresee an essential future for the mining industry in Britain and the rest of the Community. We welcome the proposed measures to encourage investment, through European funds, in the development of new capacity and especially in the modernisation of existing pits. However, we must face the fact that there are high-loss pits which will have to close at some stage. It is regrettable that because of accidents of geography, history and geology such pits tend to be concentrated in certain parts of the country. They cannot be considered purely in economic terms; the social consequences of major pit closures cannot be ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the Minister and I represent rural constituencies. We know that if agriculture were assessed in strict economic terms—without assistance from the Government—the consequences could be dire for the rural community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents before us are copious. However, one
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
important absence is any measure designed to ease the social consequences of pit closures. Paragraph 5.3 in document No. 7804/83 refers to the restructuring of the coal industry and regrets that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Commission considers it no longer possible to finance new expenditure linked to coal policy from the ECSC budget which is already insufficient to cover the restructuring of the steel industry. In the Commission's opinion, the best solution would be to finance additional requirements from the EEC budget".</p></blockquote>
A resolution which emanates from that does not deal with that aspect. What is the current state of thinking in the Community on the issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, aid is given for redundancies and retraining. However, what is the point of retraining if there are no jobs in the Community to be retrained for? Redundancy money is no doubt welcome in easing the blow of loss of employment. None the less, it is not a substitute for economic activity, the loss of which strikes at the heart of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional and social funds could play an increased role in the Community to cope with problems arising from pit closures. We should like to see an enlarged regional fund to alleviate the social consequences of restructuring. What steps are being taken in that respect? This matter may not fall strictly within the scope of the Minister's Department; nevertheless his Department has an important input to make in ensuring that funds are available from the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The social consequences of pit closures, and the costs of meeting those consequences, should not fall on the National Coal Board but, first, on our own national Government; however, they could be well supported by the EEC. Reassurances in that respect would be most welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands), who dealt so thoroughly and constructively with the documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, we all labour in such debates, partly because the documents are so general, even though they contain specific items. I made it clear at the outset that I am personally disappointed because I see no great prospect of making much progress. The Committee will understand, therefore, that it is difficult for me to reply to some of the questions which, quite properly, arose in the debate. Discusion is still very general within the Community and, before it firms up on specific items, different considerations might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I cannot always give specific answers. If discussion on some items firms up, the Community will make further proposals before decisions are taken. If the Scrutiny Committee recommends it, there will, I hope, be further opportunity for debate. I am not trying to duck the questions, but shall do my best to answer them. However, perhaps the Committee will be patient with me because it is difficult to go into full detail on all the issues.

The direction in which we are moving is fairly clear in some respects. For example, we already have a number of demonstration projects under the first and second programmes, and some of those projects will continue

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
into the third programme. There we have already seen some specific benefits of the energy policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is in research and development. Again, we are getting proposals for the third research and development programme, and I hope that finance will continue for some of our projects, particularly nuclear and renewables. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) spoke about the JET programme. It is an example of Community activity on energy matters, because it is doubtful whether any country in the Community could embark on its own on such a programme. If the programme is successful—one must make that qualification—it could be an exciting development of nuclear power. This research and development programme, undertaken in one country—in this case the United Kingdom—with broad Community support, and with the resultant benefits spreading throughout the Community, is particularly appropriate for Community initiative. It is a sensible aspect of energy policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained to the hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. Redmond), I should have liked to say more about nuclear matters, but, as he is probably aware, the Scrutiny Committee recommended for debate certain documents from the European Commission. We shall probably have an opportunity to have a debate, but of course it is a matter for the Research Council, not the Energy Council. I hope that we shall be able to discuss nuclear matters on another occasion because it is sensible to make progress in that area in the broad context of energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked what progress has been made since 1974. I know that he is not making a party-political point, because the previous Labour Government had responsibility during more than half of that time. We are trying to achieve broad objectives, and some progress has been made. I shall deal with solid fuels in greater detail in a moment, but considerable progress has been made on the nuclear front in research and development on renewable energies. Two programmes have been carried out on demonstration projects, and a third is coming up. The same has happened in reasearch and development. Those who are ambitious for a wide Community policy may say that little progress has been made, but the hon. Gentleman himself said that he was not too keen on the idea of a broad energy policy for the Community. Perhaps he will take some comfort from the fact that more progress has not been made. However, a certain amount of real and practical progress can be chalked up in the two areas that I mentioned, although no one could say that we are achieving a marvellous, wide Community energy policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I come to solid fuels, which are at the heart of this debate, I want to say a word about conservation. I make no secret of the fact that the United Kingdom, compared with other European countries, started from a rather bad position. The comparisons made in the documents show that we were not as far ahead on conservation as some other countries. I emphasise, nevertheless, that the documents were prepared before certain initiatives that were taken by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the Department in the autumn of 1983 under our new energy conservation programme. It is important to realise that the informa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
tion on which the comparisons were based was available before the initiatives were taken. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland for the credit he gave to the new initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth considering the aspects of research and demonstration projects. Under the energy conservation demonstration projects scheme, we have so far approved 253 projects which involve an investment of £65 million, of which £21 million has been contributed by the Government. That shows our commitment to the scheme. The Community demonstration scheme supplements these efforts and that gives a valuable Community dimension because the results of such projects have to be made widely available in the Community. I think that it is one of the areas where a Community policy is of benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. Redmond) referred to combined heat and power. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Government are committed to that and hope that the schemes will go ahead, particularly if they are economically viable. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that my right hon. Friend announced on 5 April that the Government will give three towns, preferably in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, a grant of up to £250,000 each towards the cost of preparing prospectuses for combined heat and power schemes associated with district heating. For the future success of these schemes, the private sector should also provide a good contribution. The hon. Gentleman will also be aware that the Energy Act 1983 places a duty on the electricity boards to adopt and support schemes providing for industrial combined heat and power, which is another important aspect of CHP. Although there is nothing concrete to show as yet, the basis on which such schemes could be furthered has been considerably improved as a result of initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Solid fuels are very much at the heart of this issue. As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) said, we should make use of the funds available as the United Kingdom coal industry is the largest in the Community. If Community funds are to be made available, we should quite unashamedly make use of them as the United Kingdom will benefit due to the size of its industry. It is not only for that reason that we should take advantage of the scheme. We believe that our coal industry is worth investing in. The industry gives us returns and the Government have demonstrated that we have confidence in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to be clear about the position of the industry in the Community. The hon. Member the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said that he thought that the Community's coal industry had declined since 1974. That is correct. He said that consumption had fallen by nearly 7 per cent since 1973. However, we must put that decline in perspective for it reflects a similar decline in overall energy consumption. The use of solid fuel in power stations has increased by 22 per cent over the past 10 years. Solid fuels account for nearly 47 per cent of the inputs into electricity generation. If we consider that decline against other energy use, it helps us to keep it in perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, there is no doubt that Community coal production will diminish. Both Germany and France, the two other major coal producers—although they are nowhere near so major as we are in the Community—foresee reductions in their production. Moreover, those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1983-1984V012P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
countries are also affected by the growth in imports from other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable scope for the United Kingdom coal industry. The coal industries of other areas in the Community are in decline but consumption is not necessarily declining and if we can produce coal from our great resources at an economic price in an economic manner, as a major coal producer in the Community, we should have prospects of supplying more of the coal needs of the Community. I hope that we take advantage of that prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More specifically, the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked me about the United Kingdom projections for 1990, which are contained in the wider figure for the Community put forward by the Commissioners. Certainly, I shall be happy to let the hon. Gentleman have a copy of our reply to the Commission's questionnaire on the member states' energy position. However, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman understands, it is not the Government's practice to make projections about the future supply of fuels within the United Kingdom. I strongly support that. Such projections are such a speculative game that it serves no real purpose. The energy industry is so dynamic and changing that by the time the projections have been made they are out of date because so many things have happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures used by the Commission for the projections for coal in the area in which the hon. Gentleman was especially interested were the estimates of the National Coal Board, not those of the Government. I hope that that clarifies the point for the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for the way in which he has responded. I thank him for the fact that he will give us the return that was submitted. However, I presume that the Minister of State has a copy of the National Coal Board's projections and will send that document with the return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly consider that. Offhand I am uncertain about the National Coal Board figures. Although we handled those figures, their source is not mine. If it is possible to make the figures available to the hon. Gentleman, I shall do so. I cannot give him a definite answer this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the heart of the matter, I can tell the Committee that I shall be pursuing it on behalf of the United Kingdom at the Energy Council. We want to see a proper initiative on solid fuels. That is important. I acdept the point made by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland that in any coal or solid fuels policy the social aspect is also important. As the hon. Gentleman probably recognises, and as the improved redundancy terms that were recently announced by the NCB for those under 50 years surely show, we probably treat the industry more favourably—certainly it is treated more favourably now than formerly—than any other in the United Kingdom, and certainly more favourably than other industries in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are utterly conscious of and sensitive to the human and social consequences of reorganisation and modernisation of the coal mining industry. Moreover the recently announced redundancy scheme shows how sensitive we are and how we as the Government, and the NCB as an employer, have reacted to the human
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
aspects. The terms of the scheme are more generous than those enjoyed by any other industry in this country. All that shows how much we appreciate the problems that follow reorganisation and modernisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a proposal from the Commission to use money from the social fund to help with the adjustment in human terms to modernisation and reorganisation of the coal industry. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that if there is an opportunity in Europe and in the Council to take advantage of those funds for the benefit of the United Kingdom, I will not be slow in making sure that we continue our considerable efforts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister ensure that none of his Ministerial colleagues virtually takes back the sum allocated for a given area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sensitive to that. I shall ensure that what we have managed to get out of Europe is not dissipated or lost in other directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney made the fair point that if we were to make progress on the solid fuels initiatives we would have to be aware of what had happened in other areas. He cited the example of the steel industry. I qualify what I now say by pointing out that we are not yet ready to agree in principle a solid fuels initiative. Only once we have agreed the principle of having a policy on that can we consider details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should just like to reassure the hon. Member, and the entire Committee, that we must look very carefully at the experience we have had in other areas. We must ensure that specific proposals for the coal industry do not lay down rigid conditions that are inappropriate. I certainly agree with the hon. Member that the conditions laid down in the original text pose enormous difficulties. Quite apart from being tied to Community-fixed levels of production and modernisation, the restructuring of the coal industry is a highly sensitive issue. We have to make our own input and come to our own conclusions. We see no prospect of allowing the Commission to analyse future National Coal Board plans over the years. Such plans are not available to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore we are looking hard, both at official level and at the level of the Council of Ministers, at alternative ways of enabling the Commission to make a reasonable judgment on the value of the proposed investment, within the context of the broad ovreall plan but without going down the steel road. We have to make sure that it is flexible and meets the needs of our industry and the circumstances of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's commitment is plain. If we look at the Community, investment in the coal industry in the United Kingdom is higher than in any other country. The Commission's own figures for 1983 are worth considering. The United Kingdom invested £695 million, the Federal Republic of Germany £280 million, France £63 million and Belgium £32 million. If we take our own 1983–84 financial year, as most members of the Committee with an interest in the coal industry will know, our figure is now over £800 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that there is a future in the industry. We are investing far more than the Federal Republic of Germany. In France, the rationalisation of the industry and the reductions that are taking place in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1983-1984V012P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
manpower are draconian, certainly in comparison with anything taking place in the United Kingdom. The figures of investment show the Government's commitment to the future of the coal industry. They also show the strength of the feelings of the Government in arguing within Europe the importance of having a solid fuels programme to support what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that I may not have answered all the detailed points that have been raised. That would have been impossible. However, I hope that I have managed to deal with most specific points that specifically concerned hon. Gentlemen who spoke. But, more importantly, I dealt with the wider principles and the sort of guidelines that I shall be following as we try to develop these matters from their present general nature and sharpen them up to help those sensible areas of
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
energy policy in Europe, especially where they are cost effective and where they are of benefit to the United Kingdom.
