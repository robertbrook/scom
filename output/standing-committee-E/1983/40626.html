<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY
(Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee takes note of the proposal for a Council directive on containers of liquids for human consumption contained in the Department of Trade and Industry's explanatory memorandum dated 30 March 1984; and supports the Government's intention to improve the environment and conserve resources without imposing unnecessary legislative burdens on industry.</p></blockquote>
I begin by saying how much we welcome the fact that you are chairing our proceedings, Miss Boothroyd. Whilst politeness demands that hon. Members express such sentiments to all Chairmen of Standing Committees, this gives me particular pleasure because it is widely recognised that you are respected by all right hon. and hon. Members in this House and I am sure that I speak for all members of the Committee when I say that I do not doubt that you will chair the meeting with your customary diligence and skill.<br><br>
I open the debate with an explanation of the delay in bringing the matter to the House following the original request from the Scrutiny Committee in its thirteenth report dated 3 March 1982. As the Department's explanatory memorandum of 30 March 1984 indicates, the problem was one of trying to fire at a moving target. The original version of the proposal was widely regarded as being unworkable so we waited and, in due course, last year, the revision process began. We thought we had something definite in our sights last November when the Commission
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
issued an amended proposal, based on a simplified version considered by the European Parliament, but no, the Presidency decided to ask the Council's environment working group to continue work on its own revised text.<br><br>
I regret there is no official version of this latter text to put before the Committee today because the Commission has not produced one. We have to make do with a Department of Trade and Industry informal text, which lacks the usual preamble containing items in square brackets where agreement between member states is still outstanding, and which, as hon. Members have probably already discovered, bears all the hallmarks of a document written by a committee.<br><br>
At least the purpose of the proposal, as expressed in article 1, is clear—namely to provide for a series of measures relating to the production, marketing, use and disposal of containers of liquids for human consumption in order to improve the environment and to save energy and raw materials. It is also about the only article of the directive on which all sides have been agreed from the start.<br><br>
The United Kingdom line throughout the lengthy discussions in Brussels has been to support the underlying purpose of the proposal, which is to improve the environment and to save energy and raw materials, but to question the need for a directive in this area. We believe that a recommendation would be the appropriate legal form to adopt. Unfortunately, at the last count, this view was shared only by one other member state, but another is undecided and a third has major reservations. We also have the backing of the European Parliament, which gave its opinion last July in favour of a recommendation. I must not disguise the fact that we face an uphill struggle to get this line accepted at the Council of Ministers where my colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, leads for the UK. The views of Members of this House, both on the proposal as a whole and on its contents, will assist the Government in deciding their final position.<br><br>
Our reasons for preferring a recommendation are threefold: first, the lack of convincing evidence for binding Community legislation in this area; secondly, because a recommendation would fit in better with the need to adopt measures appropriate to local circumstances in each member state; and thirdly, because there is concern among trade and industry
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0713">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
bodies that a directive would create fresh barriers to trade, or distortions of trade, and discourage innovation in packaging, and there is concern among consumers about their freedom of choice in the shops. If I now turn to the text of the directive, I think the justification for our position will become clearer.<br><br>
The problems start in articles 3 and 4. The original version required member states to fix, for each type of packaging material, annual targets for a reduction in the quantity of containers in household waste and for an increase in the amount of refilled or recycled containers. That would have been an impossible task, especially as the targets were ones to be achieved and not merely aimed at. Instead, under the present version, member states would be free to draw up their own programmes to reduce the quantity of containers in household waste, and to encourage refilling and recycling where market conditions allow. Voluntary agreements are permitted under article 4, and I am confident that a satisfactory UK programme could be based, if necessary, on existing voluntary arrangements such as the bottle bank and can recycling schemes, without recourse to legislation.<br><br>
There is concern in trade and industry circles, however, about how other member states would react. While the wording of the articles appears to be more or less even-handed between refillable and recyclable containers, they fear that some countries will use the obligatory nature of a directive as an excuse to bring in legislation against non-refillables. There is a reminder in article 4 about the provisions of the treaty relating to the free movement of goods. A case involving Denmark is currently before the European Court of Justice, however, and the results of that will provide more specific guidance for the future.<br><br>
The consequences of restrictive national legislation could be twofold: loss of export opportunities for UK manufacturers on the one hand, and the threat of unwanted foreign overcapacity flooding the UK market on the other. The British Steel Corporation, which has a major and growing business in the supply of steel strip for non-returnable beer and soft drinks cans both to the UK and to other European countries, has drawn attention to the adverse effects such restriction would have both on the market for tinplate and consequently on employment in south Wales. A recommendation, even if it contained exactly the same wording as the proposed directive, would not have the same binding force as a directive, because it is not obligatory, and the temptation to bring in discriminatory legislation would be that much smaller.<br><br>
As regards Article 5, which concerns the marking of refillable containers, hon. Members will be pleased to note that we successfully excluded milk and cream bottles for doorstep delivery from this requirement.<br><br>
Article 6 is a much weakened version of the original article on standardisation. However, we still have reservations about it on the grounds that standardisation, although an important aspect in the development of the Common Market, is a complex issue which deserves separate and detailed consideration, and we would prefer to see the whole article deleted. On this we are at one with UK trade
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
and industry bodies; on the other hand, we do not share their fears that the article could lead to the disappearance of imperial measures. That seems to be an exaggerated view because, at present, apart from still wine, there is no discrimination in the EEC between imperial and metric sizes.<br><br>
Annex 1 contains a list of liquids to be covered by the directive. Hon. Members will note that it includes liquids other than beverages. We believe that items 2 —vegetable oils—and 11—vinegar—should be deleted from the list on technical grounds as their containers are extremely difficult to clean for refilling. This point has been acknowledged in Brussels and we hope that it will be suitably recorded.<br><br>
Annex 2, the reporting guidelines, is considered to be unrealistic as, apart from the first indent, the information is not generally available and would involve a very costly exercise to collect. This probably applies to all member states. Fortunately, the request for such information is qualified by the words "as far as possible", but the whole annex would probably best be deleted.<br><br>
I hope that I have said enough to show Members why we regard this proposal for a directive to be unnecessary legislation which could have undesirable side effects and why a recommendation would be more appropriate.<br><br>
Finally, the timing of this debate was made in the expectation that the proposal on beverage containers would be on the agenda of the Council meeting to be held on 28 June. This will not now be the case. At the earliest, it will appear in the late autumn. I hope that the delay will enable other member states to give further consideration to the implications of the proposal. I hope too that the problems of firing at a moving target, which I mentioned at the start, will not be compounded by the target itself disappearing from sight.</span></p>
<p>10.40 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to associate the Opposition side of the Committee with the welcome advanced by the Minister to you, Miss Boothroyd. We are extremely glad to see you in the Chair and confident that our proceedings are in very good hands.<br><br>
I thank the Minister for his explanation of this elusive directive. We have no copy of the text, and we are having to make do with the DTI's explanatory memorandum. However, the Minister has taken us through the provisions of this controversial measure in a fair, and properly sceptical, way.<br><br>
I shall have to leave the Committee almost as soon as I sit down, as I have a pressing engagement elsewhere. I have explained the position to the Minister, but I hope that it does not mean that he will listen to me with any less care and attention or fail to deal with the points that I hope to raise. I believe that they will also be raised by my right hon. or hon. Friends.<br><br>
The draft directive is an astonishing example of the EEC Commission's tenacity. The measure has been around for some years now. It has been kicked around in various forms and seen by various institutions and forums, almost all of which have looked upon it with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0714">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
less than great enthusiasm. Nevertheless, it has been revived yet again. It is before us in its original legislative form as a draft directive rather than as the draft recommendation which the European Assembly thought more appropriate. It has admittedly been somewhat watered down from its original form, but nevertheless all the potential for damage to British industry and the operation of British trade remains.<br><br>
It is extraordinary that the Commission should have been so insensitive to the views expressed over some years by various trade organisations, our Select Committee on European legislation and the European Assembly.<br><br>
The directive is an example not only of tenacity, but of the Commission's almost fatal temptation to extend its jurisdiction to intervention in areas where it is difficult to see that any useful purpose is being served. One pictures Commission officials sitting round wondering what they can do next. This is clearly one of the issues that they swept up from the bottom of the pile, saying, "Let us now turn our attention to this. It may not be important, and we may not have anything sensible to say, but perhaps the damage it does will be relatively limited." That does not seem a proper basis on which to advance proposals for legislation.<br><br>
The supposed purpose of the measure is to deal with two problems. The first is the environmental problem created by containers of beverages; secondly, it seeks to reduce energy consumption in the production of disposable containers.<br><br>
The answer on the litter issue is conclusive. The Waste Management Advisory Council in an authoritative report in 1981 made it clear that refuse of this type accounted for only 3 per cent. of household waste and metal containers only 1 per cent. It regarded a measure to control this type of container at the point of production, as it were, as at best marginal in any effort to control litter. It said, rightly—I am sure that it will command support from all members of the Committee—that if we are properly to address the real problem of litter it should be done by concentrating on the litter and those who create it rather than on production.<br><br>
In general terms, we should have sympathy with energy saving. There is no doubt that those engaged in the business are, for good commercial reasons, intent on reducing energy consumption in the production of the containers. I was sent a letter by Coca Cola, one of the largest bottlers and retailers of beverages. Coca Cola told me that at its Milton Keynes bottling and container plant, in just over a year, it has reduced its energy consumption by 25 per cent. Ordinary commercial considerations are constantly pushing in that direction. It seems unlikely that an indirect means of trying to get at the problem will be effective. It is worth pointing out that if the concept of refillable and recyclable containers is genuinely to save energy by comparison with metal containers, the average number of return trips will have to rise to 17 before significant energy savings are made. The present average is about four return trips. It is hard to see that, even if the directive were given full legislative effect, properly monitored and enforced, it would get to grips with the two problems which the Commission believes that it is addressing.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
The response of those who would be directly affected is almost uniformly negative. I, and I am sure many other members of the Committee, have received representations from a variety of bodies, almost all of them hostile. I mentioned Coca Cola and I read a letter from the Scotch Whisky Association, both of which say that the measures are not only unnecessary but would impose an unacceptable burden upon them and, in some cases, be inappropriate. The notion of refillable containers for Scotch whisky is a little difficult to grapple with. The Metal Packaging Manufacturers' Association, has written to me, too, to say that 8,000 jobs depend on the industry and that they fear—I shall return to this point later—that the measures may lead to an inhibition of trade. It is extremely anxious on that account. Behind the metal packaging industry stands the steel industry, especially in South Wales. There is a complex of industrial plant there which depends on this industry. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) will be speaking to that point in a moment.<br><br>
The industrial interests which are affected are very much opposed to the proposals. The retail industry, through the medium of the Retail Consortium points out that refillable containers would impose considerable burdens on its members in terms of special storage and collections, all, it believes, unnecessary and adding substantially to costs. Consumer organisations—one might have thought that they would look kindly on the measures as they have a consumer protection flavour—think that they are unnecessary, would reduce consumer choice and would, in the end, be unenforceable. I am sure that the Minister is aware that of the 47 bodies who have been asked for representations, just two, one of the environmental organisations and one other, said that there may be something to be said for the proposals.<br><br>
We are left with the question of why the EEC is persisting with the measures. I do not wish to subscribe too fully to the conspiracy theory of politics, which is always suspect, but I wonder if a clue might not be given by the treatment of the edible oil issue. It is astonishing, for the reasons which the Minister has given, that edible oils were incorporated in this measure in the first place. The notion of refillable containers for beverages does not sit easily with the use of cooking oil in one's kitchen, but it is astonishing that olive oil was excluded. That is blatant discrimination.<br><br>
I know that we do not produce olive oil but many of our EEC colleagues do. A measure which placed the burden of restrictions on those producing vegetable oils, but excluded olive oil, would have been seen as extremely unfair and discriminatory. Given that that was overt—it was on the face of the measure— I cannot help but wonder whether a similar approach may not lie behind the measure as a whole.<br><br>
I understand that the tinplate manufacturers and the Metal Packaging Manufacturers Association are extremely worried about the measure. It has been promoted as a step towards environmental protection, saving of energy and possibly towards harmonisation in the long term, but its real effect, if not purpose, may be to provide pretexts for protectionist measures
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0715">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
or inhibition of trade. The trade is valuable to our industry and we are discussing valuable markets. A measure that gives our EEC colleagues a reason to legislate and say, like the Danes, that they cannot accept British products because they do not comply with this or that EEC-backed legislation, should be resisted.<br><br>
We are left with a final question and it is on this point only that I see disagreement with the Minister. If no one has a good word to say for the measure and most of the substantive comment draws attention to its potential for damage and harm, why are we entertaining it? The Minister said that a recommendation would be more acceptable than a directive, but why do we need even a recommendation? It may be the acorn which is intended eventually to grow into the oak tree. We have seen that happen before with EEC legislation. Given the hostility that has been shown to the measure by almost all affected interests in this country, the Minister should say to the environment council that the emperor has no clothes. The measure is nonsense; there is no reason for it so why have it?<br><br>
Legislation should be foisted on people for very good reasons only. Unless there is a good reason, we should not have the measure. That is a perfectly acceptable principle. Committee members may vary about where or whether legislation is required, but in this instance, we are unanimous that legislation is not required.<br><br>
We should take advantage of that unanimity. The Minister should go to Brussels with the full backing of the Committee, the House of Commons and all industrial interests affected and say that we will not agree to the measure. I imagine that the Minister is limited because it is not a matter affecting a vital national interest and there may not be a veto power. I should like to hear his comments about that. But he should not go too easily for the lesser of two evils if he feels that there is any realistic option of removing the evil altogether.</span></p>
<p>10.53 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wheeler<span class='memberconstituency'>(Westminster, North) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend the Minister. I listened to what he said with great approval and comfort. Since the day when the Committee of Selection bestowed its mantle of approval upon me and I considered the issue, I became more and more irritated, if not angry. I cannot think of a proposal that is less necessary. I agree with the modest and well chosen words of the Retail Consortium when it says that the measure is a
<br><blockquote><p>"sledgehammer to crack a nut".</p></blockquote>
I hope that my hon. Friend will leave the Committee comforted in the knowledge that there is clear support on both sides for resisting the progress of this matter. I agree with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that even a recommendation is unnecessary. It is the EEC at its worst. It is little wonder that 70 per cent. of the British electorate chose not to vote in the recent European elections. If this is the consequence of EC work, it is quite unnecessary, intensely boring and does a great
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
disservice. I entirely support my hon. Friend, and I should vote against the directive if we were voting today.</span></p>
<p>10.55 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberavon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to join in thanking the Minister for his careful explanation on the directive. I also welcome the opportunity that our procedures allow to someone such as myself, who is not a Committee member, to come along and speak about his constituents' concern.<br><br>
We are considering whether a binding directive with legislative backing is required. I share some of the doubts of the hon. Member for Westminster, North (Mr. Wheeler) and of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) over whether we should be considering it at all. Before one even has a recommendation, I should have thought that there must be a fair degree of unanimity. Obviously a proposal should be in both the European and the natinal interest. In view of the extent of the adverse criticism, I hope that the Minister will consider whether we should be parties even to a recommendation.<br><br>
We are considering whether this binding directive should be made with legislative backing. Would it achieve all that it hopes for? Could those aims be achieved in some other way? Would a directive have adverse effects and would a mere recommendation without legislative backing achieve the same object?<br><br>
The Committee will know that my constituency of Aberavon includes the Port Talbot steelworks, and that is why I am here this morning. I believe that the proposed directive would adversely affect my constituents who work at the steelworks, the constituents of many of my hon. Friends, especially my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Coleman) and those who work in the tinplate industry at Trostre and Velindre. I am glad to see my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell) here this morning. We share the same interests.<br><br>
I am advised that, if enforced, the directive would lead to restriction on the use of non-returnable beverage containers. I would support any action that could usefully be taken to save energy by recycling, or to save the face of the environment to any significant degree. But the dangers are three-fold. The first is that by having a directive we might be throwing out the baby with the bathwater, trying to obtain laudable objectives at far too great an expense and cost in relation to production in one of the few growth sectors in the steel industry.<br><br>
The second danger, which has been enforced by representations to me from the trade, is that we would be creating a bias against one form of container in favour of another. Indeed, in other countries the bias has gone from steel to aluminium, and the production of aluminium demands a far greater amount of energy than steel.<br><br>
The third danger, which the Minister has spoken about this morning, is that a directive could be used by member states as an excuse for protectionist measures. Surely, that is the last thing that an EC directive would have as one of its aims. Past
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0716">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
experience shows that there is a real danger of that being the result of such a directive.<br><br>
I think that in passing the Minister briefly explained the experience of Denmark. Since 1977 it has banned metal containers for soft drinks, and although proceedings were opened in 1982 before the European court, the Commission's response has been very slow and the issue still has to be brought before the European Court.<br><br>
Perhaps the Commission will tell the Minister why there has been such a dilatory approach to Denmark's action which, as I understand it, has been contrary to the present law.<br><br>
The danger is that some countries could use the directive as an excuse to ban this, that or the other, saying that it was for environmental reasons but really doing it to circumvent the free market. That is the basis of my concern. The tinplate industry is vital to the United Kingdom and particularly to Wales. The issue, therefore, is of vital national interest to Wales, because half the beverage cans in the United Kingdom have steel bodies, and that represents 15 per cent. of the United Kingdom tinplate production. We also have considerable interest in the export of the raw material for beverage can making. I hope that the Minister will indicate whether he regards the matter as a vital national interest.<br><br>
The directive seeks to encourage the recycling of containers and the reduction of energy used in production, and I do not dissent from that approach. It is a laudable aim. However, mandatory deposit, schemes would adversely affect steel and tinplate production.<br><br>
Steel has certain positive environmental and energy advantages because it is the only product that can be extracted from waste by magnetic means. BSC is involved in the voluntary efforts throughout the country to develop schemes designed to encourage consumers to collect and save containers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister agrees with me. I refer particularly to the save-a-can scheme which has received national coverage. I believe that we should do more along those lines.<br><br>
The industry has achieved a great deal in reducing the weight of a typical can by 48 per cent. since 1970. That is a considerable saving of both material and energy. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham said, the market forces and the drive for economy can and will achieve much along these lines. However, the industry fears that a tightly-drawn directive with legislative backing would undermine new developments and initiatives. That would be an adverse effect.<br><br>
I am, therefore, apprehensive and I am glad to have had an opportunity to ventilate my constituents' concerns. My advice to the Committee would be that we should continue the research into the production of containers to which the industry has contributed so much. Secondly, we should actively increase the provision of facilities, and the Government should positively encourage national save-a-can, save-a-bottle and all such recycling schemes, which achieve so much.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Lastly, we should look at the whole picture. The waste disposal agencies do not think that we should consider just one ingredient of waste. I am told that to achieve the same level of economy as a metal container, a bottle would have to be used 17 times, yet the current return rate of bottles is not 17 times but a mere four times.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Westminster, North that the Minister should take a robust view of whether we need the directive. We have had a useful debate. I share the plaudits rightly and properly given to you, Miss Boothroyd, when the Minister said that he was confident that you could cope with all situations, although I thought that meant that I was coming to an unruly Committee. I am glad to note that it has not turned out to be so and, thanks to your charm, tough action has not been necessary. The Minister should note the views of the Committee and question whether the directive is required.</span></p>
<p>11.06 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fred Silvester<span class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and lady Member has made a powerful speech against the directive, which has yet to find a friend. It is a classic with all the elements of what not to do about legislation. It begins with a generalised concept—a fair dose of motherhood and apple pie. We are asked to be against litter and for the reduction of unnecessary raw material and energy consumption, and we are told that Governments agree on that. That is a great surprise to us all!<br><br>
Secondly, we learn that despite the fact that the directive has been knocked around for four years, it is still going on. We need not ask ourselves why. It is no surprise to us that it is a combination of the continuing interests of certain pressure groups and the desire of a self-perpetuating bureaucracy to find a job for itself. Those two groups have not been exposed to any form of democratic control. The only evidence of a democratic input is from the European Parliament, which has made it clear what it thinks of the directive.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister would be on strong ground if he and his colleagues used the draft directive as an opportunity to make a robust attack on this EEC nonsense. An inability to stop trains of this sort is built into the EEC. The Commission starts them, but no one can stop them. Ministers could do so, but they always find that by the time they debate them they are too trivial. However, to those from whom we all received endless representations, it is a business, a livelihood, an industry and employment. It is not a small matter for them.<br><br>
Why do we not ask the Commission some questions? For example, the 11th Report of the Select Committee on European Legislation states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the Commission's view, harmonised measures were required since 'individual operations carried out in a random way by Member States can only lead to unfavourable consequences on the free movement of goods'."</p></blockquote>
The Commission had to say that because it was the only basis on which it had power to intervene.<br><br>
What evidence have we received to support that view? There is none in any of the documents, nor has a single word been uttered in Committee to suggest that the free movement of goods is affected. If it were,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0717">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
the measure might have my support. The only evidence in support of that view is in the contrary direction, citing the example of Denmark, where there is a risk that the directive could be made to hinder the free movement of goods. That must be contrary to the EEC's objectives.<br><br>
I ask my hon. Friend to get the Commission to answer a second question. What was the cost of this four-year exercise? No doubt the Commission will say that the cost of its own participation was small, but we have been circulated with a list of about 47 bodies—a large number at least presumably duplicated in other EEC countries. All those bodies have had to spend time and effort, to send representations and to be involved with trade associations and public relations companies. Massive expenditure has been incurred in what is clearly a spurious piece of legislation.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend will not regard the measure as small. I hope that he will take the Committee's word, both in detail as presented by Labour Members, and elsewhere in general, that such legislation, brought from the EEC without a willingness to accept the voice either of those deeply concerned in the industry, or, as represented through the European Parliament, of the general consumer, must be stopped.<br><br>
I suggest that the best successor to Gaston Thorn would be someone who could shake the Commission by the scruff of the neck and stop it perpetrating this sort of nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell<span class='memberconstituency'>(Gower) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to attend a Committee of which, like my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris), I am not a member. My constituency contains a large tinplate works at Velindre, and, neighbouring on the west, the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) contains the large tinplate works of Trostre. Slightly to the east, in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams), Alcoa has a large aluminium plant at Waunarlwydd.<br><br>
I share the contention of every hon. Member who has spoken that if the draft instrument were implemented as a directive the impact on my constituency and on those who work in the plants at Velindre, Trostre and Waunarlwydd could be catastrophic.<br><br>
Most of the arguments have been made already but I shall reiterate them to ensure that the Minister is clear about where I stand. Of the 3.4 billion cans used as beverage containers in the United Kingdom, more than 55 per cent. have steel bodies. As beverage containers form 50 per cent. of United Kingdom tinplate production, all of which takes place in south Wales, the impact on the industry of any curtailment in the production of this commodity would he very large.<br><br>
The drink cans market is one of the few British Steel Corporation growth sectors in the currently depressed steel market. It earns valuable export orders to Europe and BSC has already invested in technological improvements to its product, providing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
more efficient use of raw materials and reducing costs. Alcoa, the major producer of aluminium tops, is based, as I said, at Waunarlwydd in south Wales. My right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) would have been with us this morning had he not been with the Director-General of Fair Trading on another matter.<br><br>
I gather that the EEC proposal seeks to reduce the volume of containers in household waste, and to promote the recycling of containers, thereby to conserve both raw materials and energy. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has said, the thrust of the proposals is not justified by the conclusions of the extensive study of this subject by the Waste Management Advisory Council in its "Study of Returnable and Non-returnable Containers". The report was published in 1981, and in its introduction it emphasises how, when it was commissioned in 1977, energy and conservation issues were in the forefront of the council's deliberations. No doubt that reflected the then recent uncertainty over oil and energy prices, in particular, and the conservation of world resources in general.<br><br>
The report states that the absence of beverage containers from household waste would produce no measurable savings in waste collection costs and that beverage containers, especially cans, are comparatively cheap to dispose of compared to other waste. It says that if cans disappeared and were replaced by returnable bottles the energy saved would represent only 0.13 per cent. of total energy consumption. If the number of cans were reduced by a half, the total energy saving would be 0.1 per cent. Those estimates are based on 1977 energy consumption. As I have said, the industry since then has achieved energy savings in order to be more cost effective.<br><br>
As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon has already said, BSC has, together with its customers, moved into recycling. It now has 81 skips in 37 boroughs with firm plans to expand the numbers. Over the past 15 years the amount of tin used in cans has been reduced by 25 per cent., and last year almost 70,000 tonnes of steel packaging were recovered by waste recycling of metal cans by private concerns and local authorities.<br><br>
The Metal Packaging Manufacturers Association has informed me that metal beverage containers comprise less than 1 per cent. of household waste, and that cans, especially those in tin, with their magnetic properties, are the easiest to deal with in waste disposal and recycling. The MPMA also informs me that refillable bottles would have to increase their trippage to 17 to save on the waste disposal costs of cans.<br><br>
The proposed draft directive appears to be unwisely geared to the promotion of refillable containers to the detriment of recycling programmes and, at the same time, threatens some sectors of the United Kingdom economy.<br><br>
BSC Tinplate at Velindre, in my constituency, together with the other tinplate plants at Trostre and Ebbw Vale, are extremely concerned that a deposit or tax adjustment might be used to encourage the EEC's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0718">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
proposed aim of returnable containers. Without a doubt, such measures would lead to job losses in the industry and at Alcoa. Deposit systems would lead to an increase in aluminium bodies, which are not made at Waunarlwydd, at the expense of home-produced steel, all of that aluminium body being imported, with obvious detrimental consequences to the balance of payments. There would also be knock-on effects in those industries which serve the large employers of labour in south Wales. The Waste Management Advisory Council report suggests that 1,700 jobs could be lost in BSC in South Wales. That figure may now be a higher proportion of the whole given the scaling down of the industry which has taken place since the advisory council made its estimates in 1977. Given the potential job losses in the service sector and among small firms it is only realistic to suppose that measures which discriminate against cans would involve large scale job losses.<br><br>
The three counties of Glamorgan have the highest rates of long-term unemployment in Wales and among the highest in the United Kingdom. We cannot support any measure, however well intentioned on environmental grounds, which could exacerbate our unemployment problem.<br><br>
Worry about the example of Denmark prompts my concern that the additional burden on local authorities responsible for waste disposal will be intolerable. Wer are all aware of the present financial constraints on local authorities and it is unrealistic to expect them to invest in new waste technology and collection and disposal methods at this time.<br><br>
An EC recommendation aslong the lines proposed might serve as a useful indication of the direction that the EEC intends to take in waste management and conservation of resources, but, desirable as those aims are, in the short-term the measures would result in an unacceptable level of job losses in South Wales and would impose an impossible burden on local authorities. At a time of financial stringency, we have to be careful to ensure that financial resources are spent on clearly defined priority areas, and the disposal and recycling of beverage containers is not of crucial importance. An EC directive is, therefore, inappropriate and unrealistic.<br><br>
There seems to be unanimity in the Committee, which is a rare but welcome phenomenon in the House, and I hope that it will recommend a veto of this draft instrument. I hope that the measure will be opposed whenever possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Rhodes James<span class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the pleasure expressed by the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) and my hon. Friend the Minister about the fact that you are presiding over our Committee, Miss Boothroyd, not only because you are almost a constituent of mine, but because today is the publication date of an interesting and thought-provoking book by the right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, South-East (Mr. Pym).<br><br>
I have no constituency or financial interest to declare, but for some years I was involved with Allied Lyons and have received strong representations from the industry about the directive. The problem being tackled by the Ministers is a very real one and I speak
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
as someone who was at one stage senior consultant to the United Nations on environmental matters and who wrote the report of the 1972 Stockholm conference. The EC is right to be seriously concerned about environmental matters of which this problem forms part.<br><br>
However, when one looks at the Directive and the reception it received from every independent body, including the European Parliament, one is drawn to the inexorable conclusion that the hon. Minister for Gower (Mr. Wardell), the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon and my hon. Friends are absolutely right to express their dismay that after this long period of criticism and opposition, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary must go on our behalf to the Ministers within two days. I feel as strongly as my hon. Friends that my hon. Friend should speak for the Committee and all the constituency and personal interests that have been expressed and, while I, as an environmentalist, sympathise with the thinking behind the move, I regard the directive as insupportable.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend will take that message clearly and strongly. We do not oppose the principle involved, but we strongly oppose the directive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful and wide-ranging debate. The motion for the debate specifically referred to
<br><blockquote><p>"the Government's intention to improve the environment and conserve resources without imposing unnecessary legislative burdens on industry."</p></blockquote>
Understandably, in view of the strong objections to the proposed directive from trade, industry and consumer bodies, right hon. and hon. Members may feel that the latter part of the motion, namely the prospect of unnecessary legislation with its potentially undesirable side effects, has overshadowed the debate.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mr. Rhodes James) drew the Committee's attention to a point that I wish to stress. The Government fully recognise the need to improve the environment and conserve resources and, especially, to undertake reclamation and recycling when it makes commercial sense to do so. We welcome the voluntary co-operation between industry, trade, central and local government and other interested bodies which is already taking place in this country, as shown, for example, by the bottle bank and can recycling schemes. I believe that a recommendation would help to strengthen and extend that voluntary co-operation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) asked why vegetable oils are included and olive oil is not. The previous version of the directive referred to "edible oils" which covers both. This may be due to a translation problem—that is a serious point. I agree with the hon. Member that there should be no discrimination. I assure the Committee that the point will be made firmly in Brussels.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham and my hon. Friend for Westminster, North (Mr. Wheeler) asked why we entertain this legislation if no one wants it. Unfortunately, other member states want a directive. We have therefore taken the line that we shall settle for a non-binding recommendation. The Commission
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0719">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
has threatened to withdraw the proposal if a directive is refused.<br><br>
The right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) and the hon. Member for Dagenham asked me to give a categorical undertaking that the Government would not accept a directive. I have explained that we are strongly in favour of a recommendation and strongly opposed to a directive. However, we have a commitment to discuss the matter with our European partners, most of whom, as I said, are of a different opinion. I do not believe that it would be appropriate to say now what our reaction will be to arguments that we have yet to hear, although I have made our position very clear on the basis of discussions that we have already had.<br><br>
In a forceful speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Silvester) asked what was the cost of the four-year exercise. I dread to think. The cost of the proposal to date must have been considerable in view of the fact that it went through about 10 drafts prior to publication of the original version in 1981. Since then, there have been two other versions. If it were implemented either as a recommendation or, God forbid, as a directive, there would be additional costs to the Government, local authorities and trade and industry, but it is not yet possible to estimate them. Obviously, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Government's aim would be to keep such costs to a minimum.<br><br>
Finally, I must thank right hon. and hon. Members for their useful contributions to the debate, especially my hon. Friends the Members for Westminster, North, for Withington, and for Cambridge and the hon. Members for Dagenham, and for Gower and the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon. They have been struck by the widespread implications of the proposal which need to be borne in mind by all member states before they adopt a final standpoint at the Council of Ministers. I assure all Committee members that points made in the debate will help the Government.</span></p>
