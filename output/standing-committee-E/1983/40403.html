	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Transport (Mrs. Lynda Chalker)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 7933/83 and of the Department of Transport's Explanatory Memorandum of September 1983 and welcomes the Goverment's strong support for the proposal.</p></q>
The current Commission proposal on the EC road haulage quota has been recommended for debate by the Scrutiny Committee. I shall be as brief and succinct as possible, but I have a duty to say something about it. I welcome this opportunity, because I think that Government's attitude towards this Commission proposal and to international road haulage generally is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me first put the proposal in its context. Most international haulage traffic within the Community is governed by bilateral agreements between member states. Some agreements—for example, those with the Benelux countries—are liberal and merely provide an appropriate framework of law. But unfortunately the ones with France, Germany and Italy are restrictive. These countries limit the numbers of foreign hauliers travelling to or through their territory in support of their policies to restrict road haulage capacity at home. That policy is aimed at protecting their railways, but in each country it has been an abject failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Road transport has proved to be more suitable in support of newer industries. Rail has tended to depend on heavy industry and has declined on the Continent as elsewhere. The Armitage report made it clear that quantity licensing was impracticable and ineffective, and we have not practised it in the UK since 1968. We agree that rail freight provides economic and environmental benefits for the carriage of some goods, but we do not believe that the Government assist the economy by restricting the progress of one freight system in order to encourage another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we all know from constituency correspondence that the quota system prevents international road hauliers from expanding their businesses and prevents British business expanding with exports. It also leads, to be frank, to the undesirable practices which always appear when there is a shortage of anything. We have done our best to be fair in allocating permits and we have tried, with the help of the trade associations, to develop a framework of rules which allows for the reallocation of permits if they are not used effectively. But there can never be a wholly satisfactory system when there are such shortages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
That sets a totally unsatisfactory scene. I shall now come to the Commission proposal. It has been clear to us ever since we joined the Community that the spirit of the Treaty of Rome requires the free movement of goods and persons. It is clear that that objective has not been achieved. The quota system that I have described distorts free competition. The bilateral agreements from which they stem are uneven in effect, because they were made at different times for differing circumstances and impose grossly unfair conditions on some member states. For example, the Dutch, unlike nearly everyone else, do not need permits to go to Italy. On the other hand, we do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has long recognised the unsatisfactory nature of the system. In 1969 it established a quota of community road haulage permits, which was made permanent in 1976. The holder of a permit may make unlimited numbers of journeys, with one vehicle at a time, throughout the Community. He is free to engage in traffic between any two EC countries, whether his vehicle is registered in one of them or not. That is usually not possible under restrictive bilateral agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Originally the quota was supposed to grow so as to replace the need for bilateral quotas and to liberalise road haulage within the Community, but this objective has been frustrated by some restrictive states. Only 7 per cent. of all international traffic within the Community travels under authority of Community quota permits. It covers about 15 per cent. of UK international traffic requiring a permit. So it matters, but it is hardly a matter of major significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Commission proposal is entirely different. It suggests a transitional period of five or eight years, during which time the quota will be significantly and automatically increased so as to cover an even larger share of the total market. At the end of this period, road haulage throughout the Community will be effectively liberalised, with permits available on demand to all suitably qualified hauliers. Restrictive quotas will become a thing of the past and the principle of freedom of movement will at last be achieved in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This proposal has been enthusiastically welcomed by the Government, and we are strongly pressing for its early adoption, subject to details which I shall come to. Unfortunately, our enthusiasm is not shared by all our partners, and at recent Councils, France, Germany and Italy have continued to stick to their restrictive line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Weston-super-Mare)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend comes to future proposals, will she say what restrictions we impose, particularly on the countries that impose restrictions on us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our attempts to liberalise haulage quotas, we have faced no retaliatory action. We are giving no further bilateral permits to Italy, so there is a clamp on them. However, we are talking of multilateral permits which allow movement anywhere in Europe. Therefore, although we have not given any ground to, say, the Italians, we cannot intervene on the multilateral permits. The countries that wish to liberalise transport have been working in many and various ways to overcome the objections of the three

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
countries that I named.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not content with anything short of total liberalisation, and that is certainly the position of the Benelux countries. We are not being intransigent, but we realise what is happening to the movement of goods across Europe. We have the broad support of six other member states and the Dutch hold even stronger views than we do. It will not do for some countries to pick and choose among the Treaty obligations to find those that suit them and those that do not, which is the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin). They have sought to become free traders in the areas that are advantageous to them, but not in others. We are not prepared to tolerate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formula proposed by the Commission for making the transition from the present to full liberalisation in five years seems about right. We think five years is enough to achieve that objective without problems arising. Our only reservation is that the figures proposed—five times the annual rate of increase in international traffic—will not take us along fast enough. We agree that countries where restrictive regimes are in place need time to adapt. But they should not put off the, in their eyes, evil day by having meagre increases in the period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a formula for distributing the quota in the transitional period, which is of such opacity that I hope hon. Members will not make me go into detail. In drawing it up, the Commission has tried to balance the interests of big states and small states; those with a large share of international road haulage; and those that make good use of existing permits. I welcome the Commission's acknowledgement that United Kingdom operators have a disadvantage because of the need to cross the Channel. Credit will now be given for that. We have also pressed for more recognition to be given to distance travelled rather than tonnage carried. Most states support a change to the proposed formula to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But all that is detail and should not be allowed to obscure the principle that we are after—the freedom of movement of goods. It is in the best interests not only of road haulage but of all exporting industries. Firms ought to be able to choose their transporter freely. They should not be forced by artificial constraints to use a transporter that they regard as unsuitable for cost or other reasons—very often lack of technical knowledge of the goods to be carried. This proposal would give freedom of choice—and even if we are forced to compromise, I hope that the present situation will be eased considerably. I commend the motion to the whole Committee. I hope that even Opposition Members, with whom I differ on many things, will give the Government their full support. I particularly hope that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) will do so, as I know his views. It is high time that we did away with old-fashioned, bureaucratic, ineffective and costly means of organising road transport, which are doing no good to the industries and certainly no good to this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.40 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is grateful to the Minister for her positive outline of the document's contents. It has been known for Ministers to nod when the Question is proposed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
and for Committees to adjourn shortly thereafter. But I know that the Minister would never do that, and she has certainly given us a proper introduction today. I also know, Sir Anthony, that for all sorts of reasons it is a pleasure for you to preside over this morning's sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of it, the proposal looks a good thing. We are all in favour of freedom, and to those who favour the maxims of the European Economic Community—a free market and free movement of goods—any measure that moves towards that is doubly welcome. But this will not mean a free market in goods and free movement of goods; that depends on all sorts of other restrictions, which may indeed be wise. It provides a means of movement for road haulage contractors. The removal of the restriction does not apply specifically to the goods, but to the mode of movement, namely heavy lorries. That puts a slightly different complexion on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In her closing remarks, the Minister sought refuge in adjectives which have no legal connotations, and which I must confess to using on occasion—"oldfashioned", "bureaucratic" and "restrictive"—but which are surely pejorative. However, the Minister may know, if she has read the history of her Department, that in the early 1930s a Conservative Government introduced road haulage licensing in Great Britain, and imposed some restriction on who could carry goods. That was done for very good reasons. One reason was that railway legislation restricted the flexibility of the railways, and allowed complete flexibility to lorries. Another was that, as the popular papers put it, men and machines were running themselves into the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that the present quota system was founded with that objective. Of course it was not. It was introduced with the origins of the Community to minimise social disruption of the well-established road haulage interests of each member state. It was thought that the restrictions would gradually be lifted, as this regulation presupposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various countries—the Minister mentioned France—are likely to oppose the measure, or at least to slow down its implementation. Paragraph 10 of the Secretary of State's memorandum, dated 20 September, tells us:
	<br><q><p>"It is too early to assess definitively the views of other member states but those which have historically imposed restrictions can be expected to put up strong resistance to these proposals while others will share the UK view. It will not be easy to obtain a consensus."</p></q>
The Minister mentioned one or two countries particularly, and I hope that when she replies she will tell us the reasons for their opposition. Are they purely protecting their own national industries, which is not altogether unknown in this country—and not altogether unknown among Conservative Members—or is there some other reason?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask a number of other questions which I consider germane. The regulation opens up the prospect of greater competition in the EEC road haulage industry. But we have had a lot of arguments in this country about road safety. I apologise if the Minister mentioned this in the minute or two that I was absent at the beginning of the sitting. I should like to ask her about common rules and their implementa-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
tion, for mechanical inspection of vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know how competitive the road haulage industry is. We know from our own experience that maintaining good mechanical condition of heavy vehicles is costly. In our constituency correspondence many of us have had to deal with complaints and accusations about the Department of Transport's road testing stations and the administrative hiccups and, indeed, how the testing stations should be controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's ill-considered efforts at privatisation was to privatise those workshops and inspection centres. How does that match up? Is there harmonisation across the whole of the EEC parallel with these quotas? Are similar charges on mechanical efficiency to be made on all member states? Will it be left entirely to national Governments to supervise such regulations, or will there be Commission inspection to ensure an equitable system of application of these crucial and expensive matters, which considerably affect the total cost of movement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about lorry drivers' hours? A few members of the Committee may remember the legislation in the last Parliament on this matter. A lot of questions were raised and, perhaps surprisingly to many, the introduction of the tachograph went ahead with relatively few difficulties. I think we would all agree that it was a good thing. But is it universally applied, and if so, what about the rules relating to drivers' hours out of the cab? When the tachograph was introduced a driver in France was allowed to work at loading his lorry for many hours prior to driving off, because the regulations applied only to driving time. That was a farce. What about Germany and other countries? Do their rules about drivers' hours and the time that drivers spend in loading and preparation impose equal obligations on the employer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been having some late nights in the House, and two nights ago I saw a large Spanish lorry parked outside Palace Chambers by Westminster bridge with the driver asleep in his cab. I know that Spain is not yet a member of the Community, but it could have been a French vehicle. The flexibility for drivers and the competition, particularly when there is a lot of unemployment, ensures that drivers work hard and there is a risk that they will cut not literal corners, but other sorts of corners. That is what competition does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the qualifications and skills of lorry drivers? The HGV licence in this country is highly sought after and is an example of where bureaucracy is necessary to protect people. From what I have heard, the Department of Transport runs the system pretty well. People would call that necessary regulation rather than bureaucracy. Does the same sort of machinery operate in other parts of the EEC as the quotas disappear and as competition gets more intense?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about overloading? When I came into the House nearly 15 years ago there was great concern about lorry weights, particularly at the ports. Is every lorry coming into this country weighed? In those days, the Ministry of Transport said that it could not weigh all the lorries because there were too many of them and it did not have the big expensive weighbridges, and there would be queues of lorries, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet the transport and Road Research Laboratory
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
at that time produced a pad weight, rather similar to a huge version of a kitchen scale, on which one axle would be put just to try out the weight. It may not have been very accurate, but if the limit was nearly reached, the lorries were sent to the weighbridge. Is that done and will it be done in future? I am sure that the Minister, who is very sensitive to these issues regarding domestic lorries knows, what happens at the ports. It is part of her job and she can tell us in a minute. Will that practice be intensified as the quotas come down?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Minister did not mention it, and I do not think that it is in the explanatory memorandum, I assume that probably many more vehicles come from abroad than go there from here. The Minister gave no predictions about that and perhaps she may like to give some when winding up. People always forget that there are two sides to competition, one can be beaten as well as win.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a lorry goes to Edinburgh from Cologne, will it be able on its return to carry a load from Edinburgh to London or from London to Dover en route? In other words, to what extent will the vehicles be allowed by law to compete in the internal transport market? It is probable that they will not be allowed to do so, but the Minister has said nothing about it. However, even they are not allowed to do so by law, what is to prevent them from doing it illegally? A good inspection system would be needed to ensure that that did not happen, particularly if there are many more of those vehicles.

I therefore close where I started. While in ministerial terms—I nearly said bureaucratic terms, but I must be careful—the regulation may appear wise, liberalising, forward-looking and desirable, I suspect that whether it turns out to be so will depend to some extent on the answers to some of the questions that I have asked and perhaps on some of the other questions that my hon. Friends may wish to put to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Snape 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Bromwich, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Sir Anthony, and the Committee for my late arrival. I sometimes think that my occasionally impassioned defence of public transport is not reciprocated by those responsible for its provision. However, it was a momentary aberration by London Transport, I am sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure the Minister has already said, the regulation is a liberalising measure for lorry quotas. Having caught the tail end of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), I think that I am speaking for my hon. Friends when I say that while it is all very well to talk about the liberalisation of lorry quotas, it is the Committee's duty to consider the effect of that liberalisation, both on increased traffic within the Community and on other modes of transport. It seems to me that the Commission's objective is the operation, as complete as possible, of free market conditions in the transport sector. Those sentiments may appeal to Conservative Members. Whether or not free market conditions in the road haulage industry will appeal to many of their constituents in the next few years remains to be seen, but that certainly seems to be the regulation's objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
In the Commission's view, there are two major impediments to that free market: the road haulage quotas between the states and subsidies to the railway industry throughout the Community. I take it that regulation aims to eliminate the quota system eventually in favour of the total freedom of lorry movement, subject to weight, length, noise and so on, within the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own party has made no secret of the fact that it felt in the past that things like quantity licensing were an effective way of controlling the proliferation of heavy goods vehicles. While none of us doubts that the heavy goods vehicle is here to stay and will be the major goods mover within the Community in time to come, we do not necessarily agree to its unrestricted growth. The Government have tended to take the view that the bigger, faster and heavier the heavy goods vehicles which operate entirely within the United Kingdom, the better it is for industry. That has been a philosophy which the Secretary of State for Transport and some of his predecessors have long espoused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Community has always insisted on a quota system, partly to defend road hauliers in various countries in mainland Europe. Its philosophy could also in some ways be called quantity licensing—the Minister of State does not appear to agree with that description—because the way in which the quota system has operated in the EEC—merits that description, and it is not hard to understand the thinking behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly a haulier from the United Kingdom, for example, with a load for the Federal Republic of Germany would be inclined, without the quota system, to back load at the cheapest rate. If the vehicle has to come back empty anyway, he might as well pick up a load if he can. Therefore, he will charge as low a rate as possible. It has been the Commission's view over the years that such a practice would be unfair to the hauliers in the other country. There is much to be said for that view, although, to be fair, successive British Governments—certainly this one—have wanted to see the quota reduced. But there appears to be some contradiction in the Commission's espousal of this aspect of its policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to quote from a letter from Mr. Burke, a member of the Commission of the European Communities, to Mr. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the President of the Council of the European Communities, dated June last year. Commissioner Burke felt that
	<br><q><p>"the Commission considers that one of the objectives of the present proposal"—</p></q>
that is the proposal before the Committee this morning—
	<br><q><p>"namely the introduction of greater flexibility in the transport of goods by road, must be accompanied by equivalent progress with railway policies. This progress should above all ensure improvements to the budgetary position of railways, the reduction of their debts and equal treatment over the financing of infrastructure."</p></q>
Those sentiments may well appeal to certain Conservative Members, although it is difficult to see how Britain in isolation could achieve those—to the Conservative party—laudable objectives. Certainly there is no sign of them being achieved in any other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
country in the Community; indeed, the reverse is the case. The policy of support for the railway industry is much more strongly espoused in certain other Community countries than in this one; not that that endears the whole organisation to me. Nevertheless, if we are members of the EEC, in this country the drift in transport policy as in other policies will, I presume, be along the same lines—if that is not too awful a pun—as in the rest of the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as the Transport Council is subjecting the public service obligation of the railways to fairly critical evaluation, it is surely the long-term aim of the Community to remove rail subsidies, presumably in favour of self-financing railway undertakings. To judge from the memorandum from which I have just quoted, in the short term the Commission obviously considers that railway subsidies are becoming too open-ended, and it now favours the introduction of service criteria more specifically oriented to population groups, like the cheap fare scheme in this country aimed at students and the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition to the removal of road quotas has come mainly from the Continental block of railway-oriented Governments—France, West Germany, Luxembourg and Italy. As I understand it, freight traffic accounts for more than half of railway income in France, West Germany and Luxembourg, so they are concerned about the preservation of that income. Their opposition, at least behind the scenes—I understand that that is how these matters are conducted in the EEC—is probably for those reasons. By contrast, the United Kingdom has consistently supported the elimination of quotas since British accession. Needless to say, the Government are also at one with the Commission in adopting a rigorous approach towards public support of the railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am always accused of peddling this philosophy on every possible occasion. As I said earlier, there is no doubt that heavy goods vehicles will continue to carry the bulk of the Community's freight. But the Government's love affair with the heavy lorry will not endear them to the people of this country. Essential though it may be, the heavy lorry is largely a noisy, cumbersome and sometimes squalid nuisance. The elimination of the quota system for heavy goods vehicles, which is the trend being set by this regulation, will cause the heavy lorry to proliferate even further and make it even less popular not only in this country but in other countries in the Community. We shall watch with interest to see whether the drift that I referred to is continued. We know that it will be supported by the Government because of their belief in bigger, faster and heavier lorries, but the Opposition remain unconvinced that that is necessarily the best policy for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I follow on from the point which my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) has just made about the situation that could face communities as a result of the freedom proposed in the document for the extension of heavier lorries. Living in an area where the Al and the M62 join, one is aware of the problem that can develop from heavy vehicle traffic and the freedom proposed in the regulation would create further problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) referred to the problem of drivers of international heavy vehicles resting in their cabs to ensure that they are refreshed enough to continue the journey. One problem in my constituency is parking space for heavy vehicles. I know that that is the local authority's responsibility, but we must ensure that there are proper pull-offs and parking areas. Otherwise drivers will pull in to urban areas and cause tremendous disturbance, particularly when they move away early in the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to reorganise heavy haulage, we should also consider authorised parking areas and illegal parking in urban areas. We should ensure that the illegal parking nuisance will not continue or worsen in the urban areas adjacent to motorways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The memorandum dated 20 September states in paragraph 4c:
	<br><q><p>"Member States will be free to distribute an unlimited number of permits to hauliers, provided these are of good repute and have been operating domestically for at least three years or are already engaged in international transport."</p></q>
I wish to know what is meant by a haulier "of good repute". I am having tremendous problems with an operator in my constituency. He may be a haulier of good repute, but he cannot be said to be a good neighbour to a community. Therefore, the description needs qualification. If I am not satisfied with the response, I shall take the matter further with the Minister. There will be an increase in applications for licences. Some of the operators could be called cowboys because they develop their services without regard to the community or road safety. That leaves a large question mark over the proposal and I hope that the Minister will consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East mentioned the problem facing the railways. No reference is made to the railways in the memorandum, although the introduction to the memorandum states in the third paragraph:
	<br><q><p>"Furthermore, this proposal, which relates to one of the most fundamental problems of road transport policy, must also be seen in relation to the common transport policy on railways."</p></q>
I represent a constituency in which railways are part of the community life. We must consider the railways and ensure that there is co-ordination in the movement of heavy freight between road and rail. We should also consider the canals, and environmental matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this proposal will not be just a charter for road hauliers and that we shall not worship at the shrine of road transport. Other means of transport have valuable services to offer in the free movement of haulage—especially of heavy and bulky haulage. Will the Minister explain why the memorandum refers only to road haulage, whereas the explanatory notes also refer to rail haulage? I should also like to think that the waterways would be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that France, West Germany and Italy operate quotas. If those countries—especially France—operate true to their usual attitude towards the EEC and the problems affecting its member states, it may be very difficult to implement the basic suggestions contained in the memorandum. Where do the Government stand on that? We are told that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
we do not operate quotas and that retaliatory action would not solve the problems. But for how long do we intend to continue to turn the other cheek while we wait for solutions to the problems facing United Kingdom operators who wish to enter France, West Germany and Italy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister to consider the points that I have raised. New measures are being introduced and we should ensure that all the relevant issues are considered. We should take a comprehensive look at the matter. We should consider, for example, the environmental issues and the problems that may affect our constituencies rather than limiting ourselves to considering the possible monetary gain involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also apologise to the Minister for not having heard all her opening remarks: I was trying to get some pills. I suspect that the Minister will be much more popular with the road haulage operators than will her right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, because she is doing away with quotas, whereas he is introducing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the document. However, I am in some fear and trepidation because I do not believe that the Government are seized with the need to do more for our railway system. To me the key words are:
	<br><q><p>"the introduction of greater flexibility in the transport of goods by road … must be accompanied by equivalent progress with railway policies."</p></q>
It would be something if we knew that we were to go ahead with the Channel tunnel; that would be a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the years go by, the public will insist upon some restrictions on the areas in which our heavy lorries may travel. There must be restrictions on certain routes and on times of loading and unloading, but I agree that greater freedom of movement to and from the Continent is desirable, and that is why I welcome the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) posed a number of pertinent questions, which I shall not repeat because I hope that we may get the answers to some of them this morning. As I understand it, if things do not move as quickly as they should over the five years, the regulations can continue in force for a further three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want from the Department of Transport a show of support for the railways and a positive policy to get more longer haul traffic moving by railway. The recent report produced by Transport 2000, which showed that our European neighbours invest much more in their railways that we are, was not encouraging. That is pertinent, and I hope that the Department is studying the report carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon.

knows that it is a transitional situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come quickly to the questions I have been asked without repeating what I said at the beginning, because the Committee might become a little impatient were Ito do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) may I say that that each country has its own means of checking mechanical defects of vehicles. They are not all identical. I have discussed this matter with a number of Ministers of Transport, because I want to see greater progress towards all countries maintaining at least our standard of checking vehicles. I have some doubts about the Greeks—which I think that he and other hon. Members will understand—and their ability to check vehicles to our mechanical standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Beware the Greeks bearing anything!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My joke line came a moment too late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, South asked about drivers' hours. I think he will know that the rules under EC543/69 control the time that drivers may spend at the wheel. We have discussed the way in which these rules are operated by member countries, because, while we are pretty thorough, I have had to comment again to the Greek Minister about the drivers of road haulage and other vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will also know that time at work is restricted by domestic law in this and all the other countries. We shall be publishing new proposals to amend EC543/69 at the end of the discussions which I am sorry to say may still take some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are already discussing driver training within the Community. Some countries are extremely good and we are trying to raise standards generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the number of vehicles. Whereas in principle there are no restrictions, even at present vehicles cannot come and go with the freedom which he sought to suggest. This proposal from the Commission above all seeks to give UK hauliers a freedom on the continent which they have not enjoyed in recent years. I am naturally concerned to ensure that UK hauliers have an equal opportunity to take our exports abroad so that there is no reliance on a foreign haulier who may be looking for a return load. I believe that the hon. Gentleman was worried that foreign hauliers might pick up loads in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I made was about return loads, legally or illegally, undertaken within the United Kingdom by an operator. While I thank the hon. Lady for the answers to. the questions—leaving the Greeks aside—I thought she might have used the opportunity to insist on safeguards before agreeing to the liberalisation measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that we already have a level of agreement on some safeguards, but I cannot give an assurance that they are high enough throughout the Community. I cited Greece because it is the most well-known and obvious example, but that does not mean that I am satisfied with all other countries. I cannot say that I believe that we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
should impose an additional burden on UK hauliers, which would happen if we did not agree to this proposal from the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked why France, West Germany and Italy were not in total accord with the Commission's proposal. They have their own internal battles about the way in which they run their haulage. An interesting point is that, however much money any of those Continental countries have put into their haulage business on the railways, they have not stemmed the tide of goods being taken by road, because that has been more convenient for their exporters. It is a fallacy that we should follow the example of other countries and put more money into the railways. Instead, we should be getting the appropriate goods on to the railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me respond to something said by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). We have given 22,000 separate grants in the last few years to get on to the railways goods that would otherwise have been transported by road. I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that heavy, bulky goods should travel by rail whenever possible, and I do not think that the Committee is divided on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the inspection of European vehicles when they are in this country, and when they arrive here. Hon. Members will know that we have increased the number of weighbridges all over the country, particularly at the ports of entry. We have a system—for obvious reasons, I would rather not disclose the details—of monitoring what comes in, and weighing the vehicles about which we are in doubt. I am not satisfied that that system is as effective as I intend it to become. But we shall continue to press for the weighing of any doubtful vehicles, not only at Dover, where a large percentage come in, but at other ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enforcement of where lorries may go, and when drivers may sleep in their cabs, is of course a matter for the police. I am sorry to hear that our usually efficient Palace police force did not go just outside the gates and send that lorry driver somewhere safer, rather than leaving him be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have asked a number of other questions, particularly the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape). I nearly called him my hon. Friend, because I am so used to seeing him every Tuesday and Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Don't tell everybody!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to paint a false picture of our intentions. In liberalising road haulage quotas, we are seeking to give British hauliers a chance to provide economic haulage for goods on a wider basis. The hon. Gentleman describes the Government as being in favour of bigger, heavier and faster vehicles. Size will be limited. We have made it absolutely clear that the vehicles on our roads will be no larger than before. We have been through the "heavier lorries" argument many times, and it does not concern us this morning. And we have sought to make sense of the speed limits on dual carriageways—I accept that that was opposed by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East—to reinforce the law in relation to those vehicles which have contravened it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to say that there was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
a contradiction in the proposals from Commissioner Burke, because greater liberalisation must be accompanied by progress with the railways, and that point was also taken up by the hon. Member for Normanton. We are well aware that there must be a more common-sense approach to the way in which rail policy is implemented across Europe. But the fact that that does not appear in this particular proposal does not mean that progress is not being sought by the member countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the last two years, I have had many discussions with Ministers from other countries to try to find a way forward. But we shall always have grave difficulty with countries which will not modernise their procedures even within the railways system, and will not agree to a better system, particularly of cross-border checks on vehicles. Much of the difficulty with rail freight in Europe is due to a problem that has reared its ugly head in recent weeks, involving barrier facilities for customs and excise checking. It will be put right under a slightly different proposal. However, I take full account of the need to resolve that barrier to progress with railway freight, which is already being tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consider this a good and sensible proposal for British hauliers. Let me say to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight that, while it may seem to favour the haulier—and obviously it helps the British haulier considerably—we are well aware of our responsibility not only to carry out research on the quiet heavy vehicle, but to implement it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those restrictions are on heavy goods vehicles that disturb the environment but also on the lorries on which we depend for so much of our freight. I hope that the Committee will give fair wind to the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We owe the Minister thanks for adopting her usual courteous manner in replying to most of the points. However, she did not respond—inadvertently, I am sure—to a matter of some consequence that I raised, namely, the carriage of goods within the United Kingdom. It is important, because even if it is illegal, there will be considerable temptation to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The present situation is that unless they are part of a larger load going on to another country, carriage of goods in that way is not permitted. I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern, but I also know from the brokerage people who arrange those loads that it is quite unusual. I am very conscious that it could become a problem if it is not tackled, and I can give the hon. Gentleman one assurance. In not having a blanket refusal to allow a British haulier to take goods, say, between France and Germany as part of a load which he is already taking from this country to France, we have to be very careful about the arrangements that we make. However, I accept the hon. Gentleman's point and I shall see what information I can give him about how the distribution is monitored at present and whether the further and more effective action needs to be taken on that score. I apologise to him for missing that point. I had written it down twice, and I missed it in my anxiety not to detain the Committee for long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.28 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will join my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) in thanking the Minister for her invariably courteous reply. The problem about the Ministers' invariable courtesy is that one feels a little unkind when one says that she says, "No" to everything. If she says, "No", she says it very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was impressed, to say the least, that the Minister had complained to the Greeks about their road haulage industry and enforcement of the regulations. I am trying desperately to think of a pun of "Beware of Greeks bearing gifts", but I cannot think of one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a bit surprised to hear that the British Government can lecture someone else about enforcement of traffic regulations appertaining to heavy goods vehicles. I cannot say that some of my best friends are road hauliers, but I have some acquaintances in that industry and they all tell me that enforcement of heavy goods vehicle regulations is much more lax in this country than in most other countries within the EEC. I think that that is an acknowleged fact within the Community. Perhaps the Minister thinks that it is a good thing. Unlike the motorways in France, the Ml, M6 and M62 have not been blocked by heavy goods vehicle operators complaining about the enforcement of regulations. Before lecturing the Greeks, the Minister of State ought to put her own house in order and start enforcing some of the regulations appertaining to heavy goods vehicles in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows full well that the regulations are being enforced increasingly in this country, as my post bag now reveals. It shows the hauliers' anxiety, because they believe that this country is perhaps too strict. Whatever comparison the hon. Gentleman likes to draw, I can assure him that conditions in this country are superlative. I hope that that is the end of that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say, in that somewhat school-mistressy voice, that she hopes that that is the end of the argument. The argument will continue. Indeed, one might be naive enough to say that the whole purpose of Committees like this is to allow the argument to be heard and to continue. I accept the Minister of State's sincerity but I cannot accept that the reality is as she outlines it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) referred in his comprehensive speech to the definition of a reputable operator. The Minister of State and members of the Committee will know that every edition of every publication to do with the road haulage industry—	<i>Commercial Motor</i> is one that immediately comes to mind—contains long lists of convictions against certain operators. An operator might be fined, reprimanded or hauled up before the appropriate court of tribunal, but he very rarely loses his licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the definition of a reputable operator is. The Minister of State—a reputable Minister—declined to answer my hon. Friend when he pressed her on this point, and tried to discover the Government's attitude towards heavy goods vehicles. But she has already conceded that legislation since
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
1979 has tended to increase lorry weights to 38 tonnes, which was not as much as some members of the Community wanted, but it was an increase She says that the recent increase in lorry speeds was to assist enforcement. It was a better argument than her right hon. Friend the Secretary of State put up in the Chamber—namely that if we cannot enforce the existing speed limits, we shall increase them. At least the Minister of State puts forward a slightly different argument—that if speed limits are more realistic, they are easier to enforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not embarrass the Minister of State by lingering on the question of 10 per cent. overloads and memos from her officials, because I know that she has reprimanded if not the author of that memorandum at least certain people in the Department, but to accuse me of painting a false picture was, for her at least, slightly unfair. All that my hon. Friends the Members for Normanton and for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) and I have sought to do in this debate is to illustrate the fears held by many people in this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
country and, I believe, throughout the EEC about the proliferation of heavy goods vehicles, the thinking behind legislation such as the regulation before us and the prospect that within the next five years even more heavy goods vehicles will be travelling within member states. I wonder for how many more years public opinion will be prepared to tolerate that. When public opinion is expressed as forcibly as I believe it should be in these matters, perhaps we might have a change of heart, even from the present Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
