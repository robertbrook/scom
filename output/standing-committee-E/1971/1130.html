	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always pleased to help the Committee. I had noticed a slight tendency for overcrowding in tins room. Hon. Members will be aware that there is a larger Committee already sitting in Committee Room 10, and Committee Room 14 is normally occupied by the Scots. So we are in some difficulty in finding somewhere more convenient for use to meet, with the exception of Thursday afternoons when, if it were the wish of the Committee, we could move into Committee Room 10. Other than that, I know of no more satisfactory solution than soldiering on where we are. Perhaps I could have the view of the Committee as to whether my solution on moving on Thursday afternoon is considered desirable or whether hon. Members prefer to stay where we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you for your suggestion, Mr. Godman Irvine, but could some investigation be made into the usability of one of the rooms downstairs?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the hon.

	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 3 moved (25th November</i>), in page 2, line 23, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>() The Secretary of State shall within one month of the passing of this Act and thereafter not later than 31st January in each year publish in respect of each of the eight subsidies his estimate of the total amount of each subsidy for the ensuing year beginning with the year 1972…73 and in the case of the slum clearance subsidy for the year 1971…72.—[	<i>Mr. Freeson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this Amendment we are taking Amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 23, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>() It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to consult with local authorities and new town corporations about the need for housing and the amount of subsidy required to ensure that need is met before publishing the estimates referred to in the preceding sub-section.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reginald Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I moved Amendment No. 3 on Thursday I proceeded to discuss my three main points. The first is the need for clarification of the Government's policy underlying the Bill, and this Clause is particularly good for starting to seek that clarification. The second point is the need to ensure an expansion of public investment in housing. The third is the need for greater clarification for local authorities as such in order that they may have a greater sense of stability and certainty in their own planning, both in terms of finance and housing programmes from a physical point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I started by discussing the Minister's statements in the debate on the Queen's Speech in which he sought—no doubt as he thought—to clarify the position on the total size of subsidy by explaining to the House that the figures which have been quoted in the past were net figures to which had to be added the surplus or profits which would be drawn by the Government from local authorities reaching a surplus on their housing revenue accounts nationally, as distinct from certain areas in London and elsewhere, which would not go into surplus because of their special cost problems, etc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That explanation, as I pointed out on Thursday, added to the obscurity of the position, because the Secretary of State for the Environment said that such surplus would be added to what were published as net figures. He instanced £200 million as the net figure for subsidy with £50 million
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
surplus coming in in any one year to the Government to create a higher gross figure of £250 million. When asked to assure the House that this meant that surpluses received by the Government would be earmarked for additional housing expenditure by way of additions to the subsidy total, he said that it could not be done this way because the surplus figures could be lower than the actual expenditure on subsidy, which left us completely baffled as to what he was seeking to explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure hon. Members opposite that I am not being polemical. I shall try to avoid, at least at this stage, being polemical and arguing a case on poor policy grounds, because one is genuinely seeking to understand the Government's subsidy policy as put before us and, indeed, before the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I pursue this point a little further, because it seems to me that if local authority surpluses on housing revenue account are to go into the general Exchequer pool—which is what is proposed, since the Secretary of State himself said that these sums would not be earmarked for housing purposes, which I understand and accept as broad policy in taxation matters—any published local authority figures for subsidy, whatever the technical terminology may be in the Financial Memorandum, must be gross figures; an estimate of what the Government think is likely to be the results of their subsidy policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is said that these are net figures to which something else must be added which the local authorities will receive, and this is the test in the end—what is received by the local authorities, not. if I may say so, the jargon that we may use in order to explain to ourselves what some phrase or other may mean—there must be a known gross figure. One cannot have a net figure without knowing what it is net—net of the gross—and we should like to know how we shall have an arrangement with the Exchequer whereby money received into a general Exchequer pool, such as taxation on cigarettes or any other items one cares to mention, will yet produce a specific sum. such as the Secretary of State quoted, to add to the published figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly. I do not see how taxation and a subsidy arrangement can work in the sense that the Secretary of State sought to explain, and we need a more adequate explanation. This is the occasion when we
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
can seek to probe these matters and get much greater clarity, whatever views one may take on policy matters polemically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter has been made even more confusing, at least for me and, I believe, for other hon Members, by the answer given by the Minister to a Written Question tabled on 24th November by my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East (Mr. Frank Allaun). My hon. Friend asked the Secretary of State for the Environment by how much he estimates the present £155 million a year Government subsidy to council housing—I presume that refers to England and Wales, since the total sum is somewhat bigger—will increase by 1975–76, based upon the expected growth in numbers of council houses by that year under existing subsidy provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the existing system"—</p></blockquote>
the 1967 Act provisions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"continued, estimated net charges on the Consolidated Fund in connection with housing in England and Wales for 1975–76 might be about £550 million, as compared with about £350 million for 1971…72".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 24th November, 1971; Vol. 826, 	<i>c</i>356.]</p></blockquote>
…might be about £550 million as compared with about £350 million for 1971–72.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not add to the clarity. I must make certain deductions about these figures, and perhaps the Minister can correct me when he replies. The Minister has never quoted these figures before, although something like this now begins to emerge in the White Paper on Public Expenditure which has been published since we last met. I have some queries on that also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £350 million which the Minister quotes for the present system in 1971–72 presumably includes a sizeable figure of D.H.S.S. expenditure on supplementary benefit rent allowances. If it does not, that £350 million is way above what anybody in the House has quoted as the current expenditure on what I will call the 1967 Act subsidies and preceding Act subsidies. So one would like some clarification there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this sum to include some figure of £100 million, £120 million or more— a considerable sum—for supplementary benefit rent allowances. I have forgotten the last quoted figure for supplementary benefit rent allowances, but it was considerable. We should like to know, since this is the first time these figures have appeared, the breakdown of the £550 million which the Minister quotes when he says that if the existing system continues till
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
1975–76 the subsidy will be £550 million. No such figure has ever been quoted inside the Department or outside it relating to housing subsidies as such, so I must again assume that in that £550 million is included an estimated figure for supplementary benefit commission expenditure on rent allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that I am having to guess. Here we have the answer to a rather important matter—and the figures are very important, although they appeared quietly in a Written Answer. These figures do not add to clarity; they only confuse the situation the more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leads me on to obscurities in the White Paper on Public Expenditure published after our Committee meeting on Thursday. Here, again, is a confusion of figures and there are estimates showing figures which have never been used before. We are entitled to much greater clarification of what is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On previous occasions I have expressed the view that figures in public expenditure documents—I am concerned here with housing, though no doubt it could be said of other headings of expenditure as well—need to be broken down much more than they are. In a document of this size one does not expect to see reproductions of the working papers which come from the Treasury or are used among departmental officials. That would be very undesirable, since it would result in a mountainous volume, but the kind of figures that appear are quite inadequate, and one must seek this opportunity, if we are to approve or amend or argue about the provisions of a Bill of this kind, to obtain more information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In page 40 of the White Paper is the housing section, and at the top of the page is a table showing the projected subsidy figures. At this stage I shall not concern myself with the first column, that for 1970–71—that is past; a comparative figure— except to say that, as is made clear in paragraph 3 under the heading of "Subsidies", that first column—and the second column—does not include items of expenditure which are included in the subsequent columns. In my experience, of tables of figures one does not expect to see that; one expects to see like with like in tables so that we can compare matters properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I should not refer to column 1, but it is necessary to do so after all.
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
The first column of figures also includes rate fund contributions, not just Government subsidies in the first place, and one would like to know the breakdown there. It is important to distinguish between Government expenditure and rate fund expenditure. Existing housing subsidies other than improvement grants under the Housing Acts 1969 and 1971 and the other relevant Acts will be replaced from 1972 onwards by the new subsidies described in the documents we have had before us—"Fair Deal for Housing" and Cmnd. 4727. The estimate for 1972–73 is relatively high and reflects in fact the special provision proposed to cover the graduated transition to the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One does not quarrel with that, but from then onwards the figures also include the growing payments by the Government under the option mortgage scheme and improvement grants. The first two columns do not include these figures, but later columns do. The last four columns include expenditures which are not reflected in the first two sets of figures. Therefore, we are not in a position to assess what the expenditure on this item is expected to be. We are entitled to a breakdown of the figure now published by the Government otherwise we are discussing something about which we know nothing, and at which we can only guess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures, as will be seen, are rather important. In 1972‒73 we will have a considerable rise, according to the public expenditure document. There will be a current expenditure this year of £425·8 million. I am speaking only of the subsidies figure, and this figure obviously includes many items other than subsidies on council housing, even in the terms of the kind of figures that have been quoted to us in Parliamentary Questions and in debates on this subject in the past, which will rise to £562 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about next year's expenditure, not that in five or ten years' time, and I ask what part of that £562.9 million is related to housing subsidies, as covered by the Bill, as compared with expenditures on improvement grants, on option mortgages, and the like, such as are referred to in the White Paper? The figures do not tell us with any kind of accuracy what they are supposed to reflect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is also significant, and why it is even more important to have this breakdown, is that in the following year there is a drop of £100 million, and this is on a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
figure covering all types of subsidy—not just the subsidies covered in the Bill, but option mortgages, improvement grants, the lot. The White Paper says that this is a global figure of all Government subsidies, that there will be a drop of £100 million, and then the year after a drop of another £32.3 million and a drop of another £2 million the year after that. One would like to know the breakdown within these lowering figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been assured on a number of occasions in the House by the Secretary of State for the Environment that we were quite wrong, and this has been said particularly to my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East. Several times it has been said when he has queried this question of local expenditure and Government housing subsidies that whatever the internal distribution might be this is only a net figure; that the minimum will be the present level of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will probably go up—I think that a figure of about £40 million was quoted in one exchange in the House—and on the last occasion when there was any discussion the Minister gave the example which I quoted earlier which left us in the utmost confusion as to the intention in regard to net and gross expenditure on housing subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not pursue that subject any further at this stage, but I should like to turn to some other points which are closely connected with it. One cannot separate the estimated level of total subsidy from the actual programme of housing construction to be undertaken by local authorities. The Minister knows, as I know, that within the Department when these estimates of expenditure are produced certain assumptions are taken about the level of housing construction by local authorities. Usually there is a bracketing between the lower rate of construction, based upon certain assumptions over a period of five or seven years, and the assumed higher rate. There is a bracket of figures based upon a possibility and a probability of running at the present level of construction, and on what would happen if certain things were undertaken and there was a rising level of housing construction. From this, certain conclusions are drawn about what the likely effect on the subsidy bill will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter arising from that is investment in housing. In many ways I
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
sometimes think this is even more important than the policy on subsidy, though they are closely linked, because this is the test of whether we will maintain a healthy level of public sector housing construction, which is important for the economy of certain regions of the country as it is for dealing with housing problems. It is just as important, if not more important, to try to find out what investment policy a given subsidy policy will reflect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the last occasion I mentioned this I said that we were investing about £800 million a year capital in public sector housing construction. In fact, I was exaggerating. I find from the Government's White Paper on Public Expenditure, that investment and central administration is running this year at less than £700 million. What is also interesting to note, and this is where I begin to get really worried, is that next year there will be a slight drop, although the following year it will rise. But in real terms it will not rise at all, because on the basis of a seven to ten per cent.— I am not trying to make a point here, I am just stating a fact—rise in costs, which is our current experience over the past two or three years, the £732 million in 1973 in investment will be lower in real terms than this year's figure of £690.6 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that in the Government's view not only will we not get a rise in expenditure on public sector housing, in the stress areas, let us say, but will get a drop, and that at the very best we can expect a maintenance of roughly the present level of capital investment in public sector housing over the next three or four years; a probable drop, but certainly not a rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand how any Government can claim that they will be able to assist local authorities on a bigger scale to tackle the major problems of obsolescence and slumdom in our stress areas, which go well beyond London, and in the case of slumdom go well beyond the central decaying sectors of our cities. One of the major factors that came out of the Condition of Housing Survey, 1967, was the very widespread nature of slumdom going well beyond the major centres of our cities where people have believed the main problems remained. They remain there in many other respects, but slumdom is much more widespread than just what are normally described as the central city stress areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how any Government can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
feel that they will assist local authorities to deal with this problem on a bigger scale than has been done in the past if at the same time they are expecting to reduce the level of public investment in housing, whatever their policy on subsidies may be. We are entitled to a clearer explanation of what it is in the Government's mind to do, because the two go together. If there is a lower investment, fewer houses are built. That produces a certain level of subsidy, globally speaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that part is taken up by the new rent rebate scheme but excluding that, if the level of public investment is increased to meet these problems, inevitably the expenditure on subsidies will be pushed up globally apart from the issue of the rent rebate and rent allowance provisional within the subsidy system. This is the close relevance to trying to find out what is in the Government's mind about the policy on total expenditure for subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point relates to the importance to individual local authorities, having these Amendments accepted, whatever the answers may be to the particular questions and points that I have been raising on Government policy in relation to subsidy and investment. Even if one were to push aside all the points I have made on Government policy on subsidy and investment, it would still remain vitally important for local authorities to know each year what it was that they could expect to receive by way of Government subsidy, because, as is clearly indicated elsewhere in Clauses to which we shall come, there will be a tremendous amount of consultation between the Department of the Environment and the local authority representative bodies, as well as individual local authorities, on what I will call just the structure of certain subsidies—how they are to be made up, the formula which will be used to calculate certain figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will become even more important, therefore, for local authorities, particularly those with big housing and slum clearance programmes on their hands, to know what their individual subsidy positions will be, because there is in the Bill tremendous latitude left to the Minister—more than in any other Bill that I know of dealing with subsidy arrangements. If this is what we finally have after Parliament has dealt with the Bill, it really is of vital importance to local authorities to know what their position is to be so that they can programme their expenditure and their housing, and have
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
some sense of certainty as near as may be as to their position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the characteristics, whatever criticism there may be, of the 1967 Act system, was that in each year the formula was arrived at to establish what the representative rate of interest was to be for subsidy purposes, and borough treasurers could calculate accordingly. Their uncertainties arose from other aspects of refinancing housing such as I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, but they had this sense of stability in their financial planning, the sense of certainty of what they might expect on the completion of houses in their present programmes under the present system. I think one must build into the Bill a similar procedure to permit some sense of certainty in the work of borough treasurers, and officers with whom they have to work closely in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the general policy point, but tied up with it are all the queries and points which I have raised. I do not wish to exaggerate, but they are of vital importance not only to us but to all who seek to study the housing position and follow it in as detailed a fashion as they can to get some understanding of what is going on. If we cannot get clearer indications financially of what the Government have in mind and how it will work out in practice with this subsidy system and the investment policy related to it, it will not be possible for a sensible dialogue on housing to proceed, not only at Parliamentary level but down in the localities, and indeed, if one may put it this way, between ordinary individual members of the public, organisations outside of Government and local government which are concerned with housing matters. It will not be possible for any of them to conduct a sensible dialogue on national, regional and local authority policy if we are to have vital elements of information absent from our minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Willesden, East (Mr. Freeson) about the need for clarification of the underlying expenditure projections were very much to the point. I am a simple man with a simple mind. I hope I am literate, but I am certainly not terribly numerate. Many members of the Committee may find themselves in a similar position. M.P.s are perhaps not chosen for their numeracy. I have there-

	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
fore worked out five questions, I hope well defined, which I should like briefly to put to the Minister and which, for me, anyway, would certainly elucidate the basic expenditure position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First: Exchequer housing subsidies to local authorities in 1970–71, defined so as to exclude any payments by the Supplementary Benefits Commission and also to exclude any question of rate subsidies, amounted to £157 million. That is the figure which appears in page 1 of "Fair Deal for Housing". Presumably, it relates simply to England and Wales. My first question is: what will be the corresponding figure for this year, and what would have been the figures for each of the next ten years if the Housing Act, 1967, had continued unamended? We should have similar figures for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second: what would be the net cost to the Exchequer of housing subsidies defined on the same basis for each of the next ten years, starting with 1972–73, under the new system both for England and Wales and for Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third: what will be the gross total— that is, before deduction of any surpluses accruing to the Exchequer on its housing revenue accounts and paid to it—of Exchequer housing subsidies for each of the ten years starting from 1972–73 under the new system? This figure, of course, would apply only to England and Wales. I imagine that in Scotland there would be no distinction of this kind between net and gross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourth: should a figure be deducted from the net cost to the Exchequer of subsidies under the new system for rebates and allowances at present paid by the Supplementary Benefits Commission to make it comparable with the total of payments under the present system? If so, what would the figures be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifth: what would be the total amount lost to the Exchequer in tax remissions to owner-occupiers with mortgages annually for the next ten years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the first two questions, comparing year by year the present Exchequer subsidies with those under the new system, because this is the crucial point, and because not only my right hon. Friend but apparently even the delightful and intelligent girls who work in the House of Commons research department are very confused by what the Government have
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
said They say in their briefing to M.Ps:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The White Paper on New Policies for Public Spending which announced the changes in the system of housing subsidies, said that the changes were expected to lead to a saving in public expenditure of £100-£200 million a year by comparison with a projection based on the existing system."</p></blockquote>
It then goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One difficulty is to know to what figure the proposed cut of £100-£200 million a year is being applied—whether it is to 'public expenditure '(i.e. including the rate subsidy) or whether it is to expenditure by the central Government only."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of my first two questions was to relate the item specifically and exclusively to central Government expenditure without considering the rate subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third question, which related to the problem of net and gross figures, was provoked by the Secretary of State's remarks in the debate on 8th November. I imagine that he was saying that the subsidies which appeared as Government expenditure underestimated the real amount of subsidy going to local authorities, because from the figure which appeared in the White Paper a sum must be deducted equivalent to the surplus which would accrue to the Exchequer, and therefore to that extent the subsidy figure was a net figure and the real subsidy going to local authorities was greater to the extent of the surplus accruing to the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be true, as far as I can see, but it is equally true that that is in no way a question of earmarking. It is merely a subtraction of one figure from another. There is no question that the money which goes to the Exchequer from any surpluses on the housing revenue account would be earmarked in any way. That seems totally out of court, and I should like the Minister to confirm that there is no question of any earmarking of those surpluses. I ask that particularly because the Secretary of State was highly evasive in answering a very direct question from my right hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth point, relating to payments by the Supplementary Benefits Commission, is important because whereas those are now paid by central Government, under the new system they will be paid— wholly wrongly in principle, as has been pointed out by impartial authorities—by local authorities. Therefore, there may be a difference in the figures, and that difference should be pointed out so that we are comparing like with like and getting a clear idea of what the subsidies will be as com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
pared with what they would have been had the present system continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth question, relating to tax remissions on mortgages for owner-occupiers, is highly relevant in placing the whole business in perspective. When one is discussing expenditure on housing, it is not merely a question of trying to sort out which system or which amount of money would provide the most houses. It is also a question of promoting equality in society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman meant that in his mind this was a means of achieving equality or fairness? As he well knows, the two things are not necessarily the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this case they certainly go in the same direction. At present, subsidies to owner occupiers are running at roughly £60 per person, as opposed to subsidies to council tenants of only £35 per person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member, but I think his figures may be going wrong. I have just received what he would no doubt describe as a letter informing me that I am to suffer an axing of my personal subsidy. That is to say, I have heard from my building society that it will not charge me so much interest now. Therefore I shall not get as much tax relief as I formerly did. Presumably, on his argument, I have just had my subsidy cut. There could hardly be a more stupid argument than that. Of course, it is an unusual event because last time my subsidy was cut in this way there was also a Conservative Government in power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is poetic justice that you, supporting a Government proposing to cut council house subsidies, have had a cut in your own personal mortgage subsidy. It is splendid justice!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had no cut in my subsidies so far as I know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just said that the reduction in the interest rates of building societies will mean that his subsidy is cut. I am glad to hear him using the word "subsidy" in this respect. Does he not agree that the tremendous escalation of house prices now occurring means that the total amount of subsidy for which the Government will be responsible in this connection will have
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
risen considerably, even though interest rates may have been reduced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. I am glad to see that one Conservative back bencher is giving the lie to the Minister's statement on Second Reading that this was not a subsidy. As Mr. Henry Aughton, the borough treasurer of Hemel Hempstead—I am unhappy to see that the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Allason) has departed— said in his recent pamphlet to the Rating and Valuation Society, of course it is a subsidy. Under the heading, "popular folk myths", he pointed out that tax remissions of this kind were a subsidy and that to consider it in any other way was ridiculous. We now have impeccable, impartial and Conservative support for proving the Minister entirely wrong on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Member concede, if he calls this a subsidy, that it is a subsidy which is deliberately given only to people who take on unusually large obligations? They assume the obligation of borrowing large sums of money and maintaining a dwelling, and they thus relieve the public of any liability of having to house them. They undertake special obligations and this is a payment designed to encourage them to undertake such obligations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had the opportunity of taking on the onerous responsibility of having a £20,000 house, I should assume it rather lightly I think. I should certainly be prepared to give up any obligation by the State to rehouse me if I fell into bad times. Council tenants almost certainly have no choice of what they have for their housing. There is no difference between the tax remissions received by owner-occupiers in respect of mortgages and council tenant subsidies. That is clear to any student.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Skinner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except the amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except the amount, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) says. I was making the point that the amounts received as subsidies by owner-occupiers are considerably larger. The hon. Member for Epping (Mr. Tebbit) is in fact receiving a larger subsidy than any of the council tenants in his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gateshead, West (Mr. Horam) has no idea of the amount of mortgage interest which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
I pay. Therefore, as ever, he is leaping from unsound premises to wild conclusions. I called it a "subsidy" solely because he and his hon. Friends so described it. If he had ever bothered to attend housing debates in the Chamber or listen to Questions on housing he would know that I have frequently pointed out to his colleagues that it cannot be regarded as a subsidy, unless it is accepted that income tax should be l00p in the pound, which is what some Labour Members think it should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad to hear that the hon. Member for Epping has paid off his mortgage; I wish that we were all as fortunate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that either, you silly boy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subsidy received by the average owner-occupier from tax remission on mortgages is larger than that received by the council tenant under the present system. It is also going up faster. This has been borne out by my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Hardy) who pointed out that, with house prices rising as they are and with more people going into owner-occupancy because of the Bill—reluctantly I imagine—total subsidies of this kind are rising. Not only do we have this large and increasing subsidy, but council tenants are noticeably less well off than average owner-occupiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are thus two sectors of society, one relatively affluent and receiving a subsidy not related to need and one, rather poorer, receiving a smaller subsidy. But the Government take away the subsidy to those who are poorer. How can this be justified by any criteria, either of quality or fairness, to take the hair-splitting distinctions of the hon. Member for Epping? How can he justify this arrangement on either of those grounds as a contribution to quality or fairness? I shall be interested in hearing what he has to say about that, but, apparently, he is remaining mute. I should like the Minister to set in perspective the subsidies to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may say that they cannot produce these figures. They have been notably reluctant to produce figures in the House or anywhere else. They must have some estimates somewhere. The figures
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
must have been worked out in the Department. Even if it cannot produce annual runs of figures, the Department ought at least to produce important figures within those runs, say 1975–76 or 1980–81, the terminal years, or years for which the figures would give some idea of the general run of figures. This is extremely important. We are increasingly realising the significance of these underlying financial estimates. They are the guts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, it is a Housing Finance Bill and is ridiculous to debate these vital matters without knowing how the money is to be spent. This is a matter not merely for debate between parties but for the whole House, for Conservative Members as much as Labour Members. I hope that, in the interests of a wider and more informed debate by Members and the general public, the Minister will see fit to answer my questions in the spirit in which I ask them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister explore the possibility of estimating the yield of Schedule A tax, which is the child of the right hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Cros-land), in case the right hon. Gentleman wishes to advocate here, as he has advocated outside, its re-enactment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Allaun</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are here dealing with the most vicious part of an altogether evil Bill, notably, the removal of £200 million a year of housing subsidy compared with what it would have been by 1975. There are 5½ million council tenants, and the average increase in rent will therefore be 14s. a week. The Minister might like to work it out himself, but I assure him that if he divides £200 million a year by 5^ million council tenants, he will find the answer is a rent increase of 14s a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, that is only a part of the increase that council tenants will have to pay. The remaining and larger part will occur because their rents will be fixed no longer by their council, but by a Government appointed body, the rent assessment panels, which will fix an unfair rent many times the existing figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, despite repeated requests, the Government have withheld information about what these new rents will be. However, we have now been able to secure, through unmentionable channels, a document from the Department that gives the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
game away. It states the estimated range for average fair rents per region for the year 1976–77, when the Bill will be fully in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present average rent for council houses in England and Wales is £2·18 plus rates, and the average rent in London is £3.10 plus rates. Most of us have been under the illusion that rents would be doubled under the Bill. It now transpires that rents will go up to two and a half times their present figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote the Government's estimates, which are plus rates in all cases: London, £7·45; the South-East, £6·49; East Anglia, £5·72; West Midlands, £5·72; South-West. £5·53; East Midlands, £5·14; North-West, £4·66; Yorkshire and Humberside, £4·56; North, £4·38; and Wales, £4·18. When tenants learn these figures, there will be serious trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does not accept Amendment No. 2 it will be because we know that the local authorities—even the Conservative-controlled, as they nearly all are at the moment—will tell him that the needs of their people would not be met if the subsidy were slashed in this way. I suggest that the Minister knows this, because he has met not the local authorities individually, but he has met the heads of the A.M.C., the U.D.C. Association and so on. They have told him their feelings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us have already consulted city treasurers. As there is no Manchester representative here and I am on the other side of an artificial frontier between Manchester and Salford, I should like to show what Manchester will suffer as a result of this action, not only in the form of increased rents, but in the form of increased rate burden. I have authoritative figures which I myself could not have worked out. They show that by 1973–74 there will be an increase in the rate burden of £337,000 and that the next year it will have risen to £528,000. I suggest that the Minister will be unwilling to publish these figures because they would reveal a great reduction in the subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The U.D.C. Association says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill provides for too great a shift of the financial burden from central Government to the ratepayer and the tenant."</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely true. The Minister has stated several times that the subsidy reduction will be up to £200 million a year compared with what the figure would have been by 1975. We are asking him this
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
morning to state definitely what the figure is. If the Minister will indicate now that he will answer that question, I am prepared to sit down now, gladly, because we want to know that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claims that if the present system continues, subsidies will increase by £200 million a year in four years. I do not believe that. I believe that the Minister and his advisers are wildly out in that estimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no objection to subsidies. Almost every country subsidises housing, whether it is for owner-occupation or council tenants. With few exceptions, every government subsidises housing in one way or another. But the Minister says that for the next four years, if the present system continued, the subsidy total would rise by £50 million a year. I do not accept that, for three reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First: the present total subsidy from the Government is £157 million a year to cover 5| million council houses. How could it possibly rise in one year by £50 million? Surely that is a gross overstatement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second: interest rates have fallen, partly because this is one of the measures taken by the Government to try to deal with the desperate unemployment situation. I am not opposing lower interest rates, but if interest rates are falling, the subsidy needed to keep local authorities in balance will be less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present subsidy is the difference between 4 per cent., which was the rate charged to local authorities under the Labour Government and is at present continuing, and the market rate, which was about 9⅞ per cent., although it has now come down considerably. Therefore, the gap that the Government have to make up between 4 per cent, and the market rate is less than it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third: there has been a serious fall in the number of council houses built each year. The fall started in May, 1968, when Conservative councils took over most town halls. The Minister knows the figures and I shall not weary the Committee with them, but there has been a reduction each year in the number of council houses built. This reduction will increase. Therefore, there will be fewer houses to subsidise, and less subsidy will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the Government Survey of Public Expenditure, published last week, particularly pages 40 and 54. It is true that rent allowances for sick people and old-age pensioners will continue but the burden
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
will be shifted from the shoulders of the Treasury, through the Department of Health and Social Security, to the shoulders of council tenants. This shift is grossly unfair. I do not claim to have any standing as a mathematician but, as I understand it, £148 million per annum will be transferred from the Treasury, through the Department of Health and Social Security, to the shoulders of council tenants and this will be in addition to the figures already mentioned. It is true that new subsidies are to be introduced, but the Minister knows that they are far less than those who would have applied under the present system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr. Julian Amery)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I intervene at this stage. The Member for Wil-lesden, East (Mr. Freeson), in a powerful and detailed speech, raised a number of issues which I shall try to answer to the best of my ability. He grouped his remarks under three headings: he thought that there was a total lack of clarity regarding the total extent of subsidies; he stressed the need for more public expenditure on housing; and he sought clarification on a number of individual points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He began with the problem of loan charges arising from the refinancing of maturing debt at higher interest rates. This problem arises both in relation to dwellings built with subsidy under legislation preceding the 1967 Act and in relation to dwellings built under Part I of that Act. The amount of subsidy for any dwelling is not increased after it has been built even though loan charges relating to it go up as a result of refinancing. This problem is effectively tackled under Part I of the Bill, because subsidy will relate to the major part of deficit in the housing revenue account, and these deficits may be partly due to the extra cost of refinancing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather that the hon. Gentleman is also concerned that something should be done to meet unproductive loan charges—nugatory charges, as they are sometimes called—that is to say, loan charges arising in respect of the acquisition of land, construction of sewerage and so on, before a dwelling is completed and before rent income is available. There is no effective help towards such charges under the existing sub-
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
sidy system. Indeed, under Section 11 of the 1967 Act, there was nothing to be done to meet this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Applying the 1967 Act subsidy to unproductive loan charges was suggested by the hon. Member for Salford, East (Mr. Frank Allaun). He put it to the hon. Member for Willesden, East (Mr. Freeson) in 1969, but his suggestion was rejected, and there was a Parliamentary Question on the subject on 8th November, 1969. Unproductive loan charges will, of course, largely be met by the subsidies under Part I of the Bill, in so far as they contribute towards the deficit in the housing revenue account in which subsidies need to be a major part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister telling the Committee that a housing authority may debit the housing revenue account interest charges on unproductive works?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. It is an advance on the present situation and meets the suggestion which the hon. Member for Salford, East put to his hon. Friend some years ago. There are now unproductive charges that do not attract subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Act does that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems that people in local government have been discussing for years is that a charge on the housing revenue account has to be taken into account when fixing rents. I am not personally quarrelling with that, but the idea that the Bill is an advance on the present position on this score is erroneous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am only saying that there can be no nugatory expenditure under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If there is a deficit in the housing revenue account, it is met by subsidy, even if the dwelling is not complete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister has misunderstood me. He suggested that under the present system of housing finance local authorities did not charge to the housing revenue account unproductive loan charges—or nugatory expenditure, to use another name. In fact this is not so; they do, in fact, charge them. Every housing revenue account—especially in stress areas where this factor is a big
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
problem—carries high levels of unproductive loan charges under the present system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Under the present system an authority has to pay to meet the loan charges and does not secure a subsidy until the building is completed. Under our proposals, subsidy will be paid regardless of whether the dwelling is completed. That is a considerable advantage. The provision comes later in the Bill, but I have commented because the matter was raised. That ought to help the hon. Member for Salford, East who pressed this on his hon. Friend on 8th November, 1969.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Silverman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister tell us what this will mean in hard cash to the local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That depends on the expenditure incurred by a local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silverman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the global benefit to a local authority? Surely the Government have worked out the figure. What benefit will all this get as compared with the massive slashing of subsidies resulting from repeal of the 1967 Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman such a global figure. Different authorities have different problems. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows of cases, in his own local authority or others, when considerable expenditure is incurred in payment of loan charges for the clearing of land, the installation of sewers and other construction which goes with the preparation of a site for housing, and no subsidy is received until the dwellings have been completed. The Bill will give an important benefit to housing authorities by tackling one of the problems which has exercised local authorities for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me whether we contemplated an expansion of public spending on housing overall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Capital investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Plainly, there will be a fairly substantial increase in overall investment in housing; that is to say, if subsidies are to run at the present rate and if, on top of that, local authorities are to have an increased revenue from rents, and if on top of that there is to be—as has been widely conceded—an expansion in the private building sector, there will certainly be an expansion in investment on housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
overall, where national resources exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allaun</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister really think that that is true? Whilst there has been some increase in private building, it has been counterbalanced by the reduction in council building, and that fall is likely to be accelerated. Is he confident in his heart that there will be an increase in the overall building programme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The expansion in private building has been more than the drop in public building, as the hon. Member will have seen from the figures over the past year. Even on the figures of one year only, under the present system of housing finance there has been a small net increase in investment in housing. If, as I believe, the expansion in the private sector continues, and if, as I also believe, our proposals will lead to expansion in the public sector, certainly in areas of stress, there will be an increased investment overall of national resources in housing, contributed to by three elements: the subsidy element, the increased revenue in the housing revenue account and the private sector operation financed both privately and by the option mortgage subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here there is the probability of an expansion. How great the expansion is, how fast authorities decide to build, is a matter for them and it will correspond to their needs. It is not possible for the Government to dictate or compel the rate of progress. Authorities will build according to need. What we have devised is a self-regulatory system of subsidies for any authority which needs to build. There is no barrier put in the way and the new subsidies should make building easier, which is a considerable advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Willesden, East asked about the remarks made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in the debate on the Queen's Speech. He asked how the estimate of any surplus arising— I must express this in rather technical terms first for the record—on housing revenue accounts fitted the estimate of total housing charges to the Consolidated Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any estimate of the size of the surplus is subject to all the uncertainties and variable factors affecting any estimate of total subsidy. There is in this case a further uncertainty in that local authorities whose income in the housing revenue account is sufficient to make any subsidy or rate fund contribution unnecessary have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
the choice of using any additional income to build up working balances in the account up to a level of £30 per housing revenue account dwelling, or treating the increased balance as a surplus, in which case the surplus is available first to meet the standard amount of rent allowances and thereafter is distributed equally between the Consolidated Fund and the general rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that under the present system of housing repairs funds something a good deal more than £30 per unit is already provided for by way of contribution to capital fund, and the figure he has just quoted is irrelevant to the central argument, because he is quoting amounts which could be put by—up to a limit of £30—which are less than those already put aside by local authorities generally for depreciation or repairs and renewals in their repairs fund under the present system. There is no fixed figure, but that is the kind of figure quoted by local authorities—£35, £40 and even higher in some instances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the central point in a moment, but I thought that I ought to try to deal with the other point made by the hon. Gentleman. By 1975–76, the amount which might be available, either to increased working balances or to be treated as a surplus, is estimated to be about £30 million. Thereafter, that amount is likely to increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, there will be a total holding subsidy paid out of the Consolidated Fund, that is to say, the gross charge to the Fund in respect of housing subsidies. There will also be a much smaller amount paid into the Consolidated Fund, that is to say the surplus. The gross charge to the Fund less the surplus would be the net charge. The gross charge is obviously greater than the net charge and the difference between the two is the amount of the surplus. The estimates in the Financial Memorandum relate to the cost of subsidies. The net cost is less than the annual amount of subsidies paid; the amount paid is the net cost, plus any surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I try to explain in more colloquial language? I wanted first to get the record straight, because local authorities are concerned in these matters and will want to follow our debates with care. A local authority housing revenue account will
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
receive revenue from rent. In so far as that revenue does not cover all the authority's expenditure, there will be a subsidy payment from the Exchequer. In so far as there is a surplus, half that surplus will go to the Consolidated Fund. The amount of subsidy paid to an individual local authority has nothing to do with the surplus earned by another local authority. An individual local authority will receive the full amount of subsidy, the gross amount of subsidy, with no deduction of any sort. Equally, an authority not receiving subsidy but earning surplus will pay half its surplus into the Consolidated Fund, and we estimate that it might be about £30 million after a few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us get this clear. Is the Minister seriously telling us that after three or four years, whatever it may be, the Ministry estimates that the surplus received by the Exchequer into the Consolidated Fund from housing revenue accounts nationally will not be more than £30 million? Is he putting that figure to us seriously?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the best estimate I can give. Obviously, it has to be very tentative indeed, but this is the kind of basis from which it will possibly grow in due course. To begin with, most local authorities will need all the increases in rents plus the subsidies to make their housing revenue accounts balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gilbert Longden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the justification for the provision that half the surplus earned by local authorities which have received no subsidy should go to the Consolidated Fund?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That issue was raised on Second Reading, and we will come to it later. The broad justification is that it is, after all, Exchequer subsidy which has led to the building of council houses and, therefore, the Exchequer has some claim on surplus arising as a result of revenue contributed to a housing revenue account by tenants on an authority's property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the figure of £30 million based on an assumption that every tenant will claim the rebates to which he may be entitled? Is the right hon. Gentleman basing this estimate on a 100 per cent, take-up of rebates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not by any means. In due course, when we come to discuss rebates, we shall discuss in detail the best estimate one can make on this score. I am merely giving the best guess I can of what the total surplus is likely to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silverman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that this surplus is provided, where there is a surplus, not so much by the local authority but out of the rents of the tenants? Therefore, is not this a method of taxation through the rents of tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree with that at all, because the rent paid by a tenant will be an approach to the market rent, with the scarcity element discounted. The tenant will be paying a fair rent and I do not think that the fact that he is paying a fair rent instead of getting a subsidised rent could be called a tax. We have already heard the illogical view that tax relief is a subsidy, but to suggest that the removal of the subsidy is a tax seems to be even more illogical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In what year will this £30 million surplus be reached?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: About 1975.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not 1975–76?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman asked me some questions about the White Paper on Public Expenditure. The figures include Scotland. They show a peak of £562 million, but that is because that includes about £50 million for arrears of existing subsidies and about £40 million to take account of the transfer of balances from the housing repairs and equalisation account. These are technical factors, but making allowance for them, the line is basically the same year by year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman laid considerable stress on the need to inform individual local authorities and, of course, this is basically the Amendment what subsidies they may expect in any given year. The advance publication of estimates of the total cost of subsidies would not be of much help to housing authorities. The amount of subsidy which an authority may expect to receive for the following year can best be estimated by the authority itself in the light of its knowledge of the factors which determine the amount of subsidy, it knows the state of the housing revenue account better than anybody else and it knows its own building and slum clearance programme.
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
In so far as any deficit occurs on the housing revenue account it will be met by subsidy. Indeed, it is far easier for the authority to estimate its likely individual subsidy entitlement for the next year than it is for my right hon. Friend or myself to estimate the total likely requirements for the purposes of making provision in the annual Estimates. Such provisions will be made on the best estimate which can be made and any Supplementary Estimate which becomes necessary will, of course, be submitted to Parliament in the ordinary way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will appreciate that this can only be done by borough treasurers when the formula, which we will discuss in greater detail later, relating to reckonable expenditure in relation to rising cost subsidies, for instance, is known to individual treasurers. Are we to have this information in the hands of treasurers in good time, say, in January, or December, or November, before they propose their budgets in the months leading up to March, each year? Is there to be annual information, or is it to be fixed once in every five years or so, so that they do not have to worry about it, a formula which will decide their individual costs and their rate expenditure and Exchequer subsidy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to the detailed formula when we come to the relevant provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I am saying now is that a local authority will receive subsidy in so far as it incurs a deficit on the housing revenue account. It knows better than we know what deficit is likely to arise in the light of its knowledge of its own housing revenue account and its programme of building and how much of that programme will be completed in a given year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great merit of the Bill, one of its most progressive features, that any deficit incurred on the housing revenue account as a result of building and as a result of rebates and allowances will be met by subsidy. So all a borough treasurer in effect has to do is to study the expenditure which his plan will involve, the project which the housing plan for the year will involve, look at the state of the housing revenue account, and make his best estimate of what it will be in the course of that year, and, in so far as he foresees a deficit, he will know that that is the amount of subsidy he will get.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not seen the point. I am not concerned at the moment with the actual nature of the formula or the different structures of the subsidy and we will deal with those when we come to them. However, they lie in the end with the Secretary of State. Unlike previous Housing Subsidy Acts, in this instance they are not calculated and written into the Bill as a system. They will be based on the results of consultation with the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking by the Amendments to ensure that local authorities, on the basis of information received from the Secretary of State at least annually, will know not only what their deficit will be—they can calculate that—but what they may receive from the Exchequer by way of subsidy. This cannot be known at this stage because it is based upon a consultative procedure which we will discuss in detail later. What we are seeking to establish now is that information will be made available to local authorities annually so that they know what they are to receive, or can calculate what they are to receive in that coming year. There is no indication in the Bill as it stands. That is what is worrying us and some local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the principle of the Bill. Broadly speaking, it is that any deficit incurred is met mainly by the Exchequer and partly by the rates on any building project for which loan sanction has been approved. If that is so, the ability to calculate a deficit enables the local authority to calculate the subsidy entitlement. I hope that I have made the point clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the right hon. Gentleman has not. It is not in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in Clause 4, and we shall come to that shortly, I hope. But the principle is simple—that a local authority receives a subsidy in respect of the deficit in its housing revenue account which arises over and above its revenue from rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Information will be available in advance about what expenditure is reasonable, at least as much information as at present. I should have thought that that was the only calculation one could make, that the local authority today knows what it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
going to get and will know, more or less in the same way, as a result of calculating its likely deficit, what its subsidy entitlement will be. The annual estimates for housing subsidies do not at present distinguish between subsidies payable under different enactments let alone between different subsidies payable under the same enactment. The intention is, as is now the case, to pay for any year the amount of subsidy to which entitlement has been established, and if the precise entitlement has not been established, to pay on the best estimate that can be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eddie Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying in effect that his Department is completely in the hands of the housing authorities and that whatever they commit themselves to do, whatever their deficits, the Exchequer will be paying them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For any project for which loan sanction has been received, and which therefore has had to come within those criteria. An authority will be entitled to go ahead with any project for which approval has been given and will be encouraged to do so. If it incurs a deficit in the process, that deficit will be met out of subsidy from the Exchequer and a small proportion from the rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been assured that this is dealt with in Clause 4. The Minister is again mistaken. I have checked the provision and it refers to the Secretary of State, after consultation with various authorities and associations, "from time to time" laying down what reckonable expenditure, for instance, may be. It makes no reference to providing this information annually. What we are seeking is not to discuss what the reckonable expenditure shall be, what the formula for different subsidies shall be, but a provision for annual information to local authorities from which they may make their calculations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I will meet the hon. Gentleman if I say quite simply that the determination of reckonable expenditure will be made in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Annually?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Annually. That should meet the problem. Reckonable expenditure will be defined and known in advance. That being so, a local authority will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
entitled to secure subsidy on any deficit arising out of approved projects in any given year.

The hon. Member for Gateshead, West (Mr. Horam) asked me how about the total tax relief on mortgage interest. The information on future estimates is a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and, though the Financial Secretary explained that estimates over the next ten years would be quite unreliable, I refer the hon. Member to c. 350 of Hansard for 27th October, 1971.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did ask four other questions before I mentioned mortgage interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a note of the hon. Member's questions. He asked what would be the net cost to the Exchequer over ten years? One cannot say exactly, but for 1970–71, £150 million Exchequer subsidies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allaun</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister go slowly, please?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will have to refer to the Gentleman's questions. I thought that I had the information, but I have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil McBride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman saying seriously that his department cannot make an economic projection of the moneys required over the next five years, which is a reasonable economic projection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely difficult to rationalise a system. It is not possible in advance to speak with any certainty of the exact financial implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McBride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is elementary economics. The Department should be aware of that. The Minister is saying in effect that this forecast has not been made. If not, why not? He is the Minister responsible. Will he tell us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have made the best estimate we can. We think that the subsidies, including the supplementary benefit element which I should have said is £150 million, will total £350 million or thereabouts over the fore-
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
seeable future, instead of the much higher sum to which we think it would have risen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One accepts that it would be extremely difficult for the Department to provide precise figures, and one accepts that imprecision is inevitable here, but does this not mean that Amendment No. 2 is even more relevant, because of that imprecision, than it would be otherwise, since the Government, by consultation with local authorities, would have a capacity to be a little more precise than they are at the present time? I see the Amendment as purely reasonable, and I am sure that if the right hon. Gentleman were to consult all local authority associations they would agree with that view. Not one of them, of course, is majority Labour-controlled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can already help the hon. Member for Gateshead, West. Some figures have been pressed into my hand. As he knows, the present total subsidy figure is £350 million. We think that it will be £340–£350 million in 1972–73; £300–£325 million in 1973–74; £325–£350 million in 1974–75, and £300–£350 million in 1975–76. As I said, these are very rough projections and not something on which I should wish to be bound in evidence. I give them as the best projections I can in an attempt to help the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silverman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes projections for the total amount of subsidies in 1975–76. Presumably that total results from calculation of the total addition of subsidies and projections which have been made for the various subsidies in Clause 1. What we are asking of the Minister, and what the Amendment asks, is that he will give the Committee the benefit of his arithmetic here and to decide how this total is reached. What do the Government expect to spend on the first subsidy, on the residual subsidy, on the rising costs subsidy? How much does the Minister expect rebates to cost in 1975–76? We realise that the figures may be tentative, but we want to know what is in the Government's mind here, and what local authorities can expect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Gentleman, in very broad terms, again, and with all the qualifications I have just made, that in the first year the residual subsidy will be about £110 million. It will reduce in 1973–74 to £40 million; in 1974–75 to £20 million; and in 1975–76 to about £5 million.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
Other subsidies, apart from slum clearance and rent allowances, will total £210–£230 million in the first year; £200–£250 million in the second; £240–£290 million, or thereabouts, in the third, and £250–£300 million in the fourth. The slum clearance subsidy will start in the first year at somewhere between £5 and £10 million, increasing in the second year to £5–£15 million; in the third year to £10–£20 million, and in the fourth to £10–£25 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rent allowances subsidy—and, of course, this involves the most crystal-gazing—will be £5–£10 million in the first year; £30–£50 million in the second year, and about the same in the third and fourth years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are extremely tentative figures and I think hon. Gentlemen on both sides of the Committee should be cautious in placing too much importance on them. A complete change of system is involved, and we might very easily miscalculate if we attached excessive importance to them, but they are the type of calculation on which our thinking has been based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allaun</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand the difficulty in providing these figures for some years ahead when the Minister has problems knowing the involvements of each local authority, but I want to put a very simple question to him. Earlier this morning I quoted from a private Ministry document estimating the average rent levels for the various regions by 1976. Does the Minister accept the authenticity of this document and does he stand by those estimates? That is all I ask, but we are entitled to a definite answer. Have I stated that document correctly? Does the Minister stand by those estimates which show a rent increase of roughly to two-and-one-half times the present figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very glad to study it and comment on it in the Clause stand part debate. I am not absolutely sure that this arises on the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McBride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In conclusion, in the light
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
of the comments I have made on speeches of hon. Gentlemen on both sides of the Committee, I regret that my hon. Friends I and I are unable to advise the Committee to accept either Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is the Minister saying that my hon. Friend has quoted a document, which I under stood him to say is an official Ministry document, and that the Minister responsible for that Department is saying that he f is not aware of such a document and, indeed, has not seen it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McBride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been wanting to put a question to the right hon. Gentleman. Yesterday I asked his Friend the Minister of State for Wales what was the percentage of the average income in Wales paid in rent at the present time by tenants of council 'houses and by tenants of privately-owned property respectively, and what the percentage would be in both cases if the Bill were enacted. He said that no figures are available to show the average incomes of council or private tenants or the forecast of rents made. It follows that no forecast can be made of the hon. Gentleman's assumption. But the reference made by my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East (in this document), the truth of which is not contravened, means that someone, somewhere, has made an economic projection, that the figures are available and, perhaps, inadvertently they have slipped out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Purely objectively, and because it bears on the actuarial matter of the Bill and because it is of paramount importance to 5½ million council tenants, it is important that the Minister should now say what is the exact substance of this document. Is this true? Alternatively, can forecasts be made? There must be eminent economists in his Department who have made the projections and the Minister must know what these projections are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said just now to the hon. Member for Salford, East, I shall be very glad later to try to comment on the point he raised, and on the points which the hon. Gentleman himself now raises specifically in regard to Wales. I myself have not seen the paper, nor have I had an analysis of it prepared for me, but I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
shall undertake to do so before we debate the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped, as a result of the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Willesden, East (Mr. Freeson), that one would begin to see the financial implications of what we are talking about with some degree of clarity. With the utmost respect to the Minister— it may be my deficiency, and I bear in mind the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, West (Mr. Horam), about the state of numeracy of Members of Parliament—having heard what I have and having tried to check what else has been said while I was out for a short time, I am in a far greater state of confusion than ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regardless of his attitude to the Amendment, would the Minister consider it reasonable and of assistance to the Committee as a whole to submit at some early stage in our proceedings a fairly detailed memorandum showing us with absolute clarity, accepting the difficulty of giving accurate forecasts, and in a comprehensible form all the figures which are so obviously relevant not merely to our present discussions but to subsequent debate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that the Minister would not like us to think that the Government had anything to hide. There may be a fundamental difference between us in the philosophical approach to housing and how it should be financed, but regardless of the basic policy differences it seems reasonable that all members of the Committee, regardless of the prejudice with which they may approach the matter to begin with, should have a clear understanding of what we are discussing. I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to this suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confused because so many figures have been quoted by so many people. The Minister has given us forecasts which he tells us are necessarily and essentially imprecise, and I accept that. Perhaps he can at least enable us to understand a little better the figures he has given us. Where he has indicated the possible subsidy in total between 1970–71 and 1975–76, he might assist us to a greater understanding of the basis of the Government's thinking if he also told us what he believes, on the best information available to him, the figures would be if the present policy of subsidies were not changed. We might then at least make a year by year comparison, and understand what the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
believe are likely to be the consequences of their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an argument about policy. It is a very sincere and genuine request that in our deliberations the Minister should use the resources at his disposal to enable us at least to understand what the Government have in mind. I am sure that it will be for the good of the Government, too, to understand what they have in mind and what the consequences of their policies are likely to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. If the existing subsidy system continued, the annual total net charges on the Consolidated Fund in connection with housing in England and Wales, including payments made towards rents by the Supplementary Benefits Commission, would increase by about £200 million by 1975–76 and by perhaps £400—£500 million by 1980–81. Those are the best figures I am able to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to have been unable to satisfy the requests of many of my colleagues, certainly with respect to the document of the rent figures for the various regions of the country. I hope that he will manage at some early date perhaps not to allay the Committee's fears but at least to explain precisely whether or not the document which has been talked about and which establishes these rent figures is correct and was given some consideration around December 1970, and also, given that there has been inflation to the extent of 10 per cent, since that time, whether those rent figures are now out of date and whether we should be adding 10 per cent, to the figures produced by the Ministry at that time, if it is in fact an authentic document. I have every reason to believe that it is, because it was circularised in the Press to a large extent last week, and so far I have not seen the Ministry going to any great lengths to deny the authenticity of those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was also very hazy, until actually pulled out of his mess, on the question of subsidies, and the allocation of the various subsidies which will come into effect when the Bill becomes law, if ever it does. The residual subsidy is a misnomer. If ever there was a misuse of the English language, the use of the words "residual subsidy" is certainly one, because this is something that takes away; it does not give. It means that £20 per dwelling per
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
year will be taken away from every local authority. I have statistics from the Derbyshire authorities which show that over the next two years they will all lose all their existing subsidies based on the 1970‒71 financial year, with the exception of Glossop in the north-west. Places like Chesterfield, with a subsidy of around £29 per dwelling, will have lost all theirs by the end of the second year when the withdrawal factor takes effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the so-called intermediate area authorities, which were granted special aid from the Housing Ministry by making the grant improvement 75 per cent, instead of 50 per cent., will now be placed in the embarrassing position of being affected by the withdrawal of all the subsidies, due to the effect of the residual subsidy, long before the two years have actually elapsed if one wants to use that kind of measurement of time. The net result is that these so-called intermediate areas, which have been granted this special aid deliberately because they are less well off than some of the other regions in the country, will then be contributing to the better off regions by the creaming off on housing revenue account with the 50 per cent, which the Government take. It is an appalling state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Heanor Urban District Council, as recently as 1969 placed in an intermediate area, with the 1969 Act improvement grants amended by this Government only a few months ago, will suffer as a result of the residual subsidy. And it will not benefit to any great extent by the rising costs subsidy, because when one takes into account the extra amount in rent income of £26 it cannot get anything on rising costs subsidy. Very few authorities will get anything there apart from those where land prices are soaring—unless the Government intend to sponsor inflation to the extent of more than 30 per cent., because the excess £6 in £20 represents more than 30 per cent, inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are therefore really saying that, except for those local authorities which have a massive land price problem, none of the Derbyshire urban and rural districts and small boroughs can benefit from the rising costs subsidy unless there is inflation to the extent of more than 30 per cent, in the price of housing. I am not one to say that the prices of houses
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
will not rise considerably. They are already rising because of the anticipation by the property speculators of what the Bill would contain. They have been able to anticipate the Market forces and push up house prices by as much as 16 per cent, over the last 15 or 16 months. That will certainly take place. But all these authorities, with the exception of Glossop—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Le Marchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not realise that the Bill shows that Glossop is the one place that, if he knew it, he would realise really does need it?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pretty certain that Glossop does need it, since it is represented by the hon. Member. They certainly need assistance of some kind, because they are not getting a great deal for him since he is almost certain consistently to vote against us when we attempt, for instance, to reduce the withdrawal factor for Glossop by £20 or delay it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Le Marchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will realise that two of his friends tried to put Glossop into Manchester yesterday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skinner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot account for what my hon. Friends do. [	<i>Interruption</i>] One of my hon. Friends says that is one way of getting rid of the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the first two years of operation, notwithstanding what the Minister had to say on the calculation of subsidies, the whole of that £1,546,000, with the exception of the very small part of Glossop's Exchequer subsidy which may be of the order of about £10,000 or less, Derbyshire local authorities will have lost most of the subsidies, and will be hard put to benefit from any of the other existing subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They cannot get anything out of the transition subsidy, because it is meaningless. It is inserted to offset the amount of money that does not come in from rent income. When one considers that £26 must come in in the first year and £20 will be taken away, the transitions subsidy is meaningless. None of these local authorities will benefit by that subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the authorities in Derbyshire, which are not embarrassed by the price of land to the same extent as are London authorities, will not benefit by the rising costs subsidy. It is true that there will be local authority tenants who will benefit to some degree by the rent rebate subsidy, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
very few people can get it in the first two years. That is one of the reasons for the Minister's figures on rent rebate subsidy being very small over the first two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper gives examples of income and the amount of rebate saved on a rented house. In Derbyshire the rent will be approximately £3, as distinct from slightly below the £2 mark. If one looks at the Appendix to the White Paper, and takes the case of a married man with two children and a gross income of £30 a week, which—my colleagues have suggested in reality is less than £24—as showing an average net income for many council tenants in the Derbyshire authorities, that man gets nothing on a £3 rent. There are the two 50p increases during the next two financial years. They will increase the rent payment to the local authority to £3 on average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It means that the local authorities will get nothing for the rent rebate subsidy either, because they will not be paying out a rent rebate subsidy to any great extent, except to those on very low incomes, or who are unemployed at present and are receiving the money in the supplementary benefit. So the residue of that amount, coming as it does from the local authorities, will be about the only amount of money that will come into this so-called rent rebate subsidy. Anyway, they will be helping to pay for it, because even after two years it is evident that many local authorities will have a surplus on their housing revenue account Those as low as 17 and 19, which will be phased out in the first year's operation of the withdrawal factor of the residual subsidy, will have a surplus on the housing revenue account even after the first year. The net effect will be that they will be transferring money to the better-off regions in the country within the first year's operation of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall argue that point if we reach it before the Government decide to introduce the guillotine, which I have no doubt they will in order to frustrate our attempts to improve the possibility of the Glossop council tenants obtaining some element of benefit from the Bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
the Amendment, Mr. Godman Irvine. Everything I have said has arisen out of what the Minister and some of my colleagues have said on the matter. We are trying to establish what kind of rent levels and real subsidies will result from the Bill over the next few years. It is important to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have here one of the most reactionary changes that have taken place in housing finance since local authorities became housing authorities in 1919. The Bill removes all previous subsidies. This has never been done before. There have been changes in subsidies. There have been additions. In 1959, the previous Tory Administration removed the subsidy for general needs, saying that they would have a slum clearance subsidy and that they would get rid of the slums in ten years' time. Well, the slums are still here, and we are still hearing the same slogan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it is important that we know upon what basis the Bill has been introduced. We want to know what rent levels have been estimated. The Ministry must have gone into these figures; it could not have come to these conclusions in any other way. In the absence of figures, I must interpret what the rent levels will be. The only guide available at present, is the fair rents that have been established in the private sector, the 14 per cent, of those rents in that now-regulated sector of private tenancies which has resulted in rent increases of the order of three or four times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept £4·95 as a fair rent for pre-1919 houses—£5 exclusive of rates based on the private sector of pre-1919 houses— it is evident that some of the council houses built in the 1960s, with more modern amenities, will get increases of rents of £5 to £6, rising to £7 and £8, which is suggested as the maximum in certain parts of the Bill. That is why I must make these points. We will be shadow boxing every time we put forward Amendments unless the Minister is prepared to tell us precisely what kind of rent levels result from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From these rent levels on which we have managed to obtain information from this so-called Ministry document, it is clear that we are faced with nothing short of Government-sponsored inflation. I have had a letter from the U.D.C. Association. It has no political axe to grind. It has more Tory-controlled urban district councils than Labour. That situation will change
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
somewhat next May. It changed last May and it will probably change when the reorganisation takes place, despite the gerrymandering that is going on over the new district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The U.D.C. Association is quick to point out that nearly two-thirds of the local authorities in the first year will be subjected, by this 50p increase, to an increase of more than 25 per cent, in their rents, because the average rents in urban district councils are slightly over £2. It makes the point, rightly, that this is Government-sponsored inflation. It is no use blaming, as the Government consistently do, the Jack Joneses, the Hugh Scanlons and Lawrence Dalys of this world for putting in for justified wage claims, when the Government are now sponsoring inflation to the extent that 5½ million council tenants will be subjected to these massive rent increases year after year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the local authority associations—the rural district councils, the municipal boroughs, the urban districts—none with any political axe to grind—have been making it clear to us that there must be some attempt by the Minister at a very early stage to tell us precisely what the new rent levels are likely to be. It is pretty clear that the Government must know because all the calculations must be based on that, and as we are failing to get these answers one can only conclude that the Government are merely hiding the harsh realities of the Bill. They are trying to kid people on that the rent rebate allowance and the rent rebate subsidy for the public sector, the council tenants, will overshadow these massive increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of anything from the Minister, I have tried to establish that, certainly in Derbyshire over the first two years, the removal of the residual subsidy—because that is what it really is over those first two years; the withdrawal factor—means that all of those authorities, with the exception of Glossop, will lose all their subsidies and gain almost nothing from the other subsidies provided in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, as I have tried to explain, that some other authorities, mainly in the large conurbations, will have their subsidies ameliorated to some degree by the inclusion of some of these others, but these certainly will not offset the fact that the residual subsidy, as the Minister explained,
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
in the first year, will reduce the £157 million which the Government told us was the amount of Government subsidy at the end of the 1970–71 financial year. It is likely to be slightly more at March 31st, 1971–72, but he gave us a figure of only slightly over £100 million as the amount that would be left that is now to be earmarked as residual subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in the absence of all these figures, I hope that the Minister will attempt to let the Committee know on precisely what this Bill is based, and what kind of rent levels within a range of about 25p or 50p all the various regions will have to suffer, so that we can put forward the proper representations from all our local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Minister has not explained, either in the White Paper on in the Bill, precisely what kind of rent levels and subsidies will ensue, the net result is that local authorities, Tory and Labour alike, are meeting, and are now taking action not to do anything about the Bill while it is passing through the House. Several authorities in and around the Mansfield borough, including Mansfield itself, met on Friday night, and because they are so frustrated by what is taking place and by the absence of these figures, have said that they will not do anything to support any part of the Bill, certainly until it has been passed enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must know what that means. It means that authorities are not making preparations with regard to taking on extra staff in order to calculate the rent rebate subsidies and various things of that kind. It means that they are not making up their housing revenue account estimates on the basis that there will be a 50p increase starting on April 1st—that is almost certainly out. And many authorities, including those I have mentioned, some of them in my constituency, intend to make it very clear that they will not take part in this sham exercise, in this charade, in which the Minister will not tell us precisely what the rent levels are likely to be within the next year, and the year after, and several years after that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not asking about 1981: we are trying to get some realistic estimates for the next three or four years. The right hon. Gentleman is able to make an estimate of 50 pence which has to be put on for the next three or four years—he has made that abundantly clear, so the local authorities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
have every right to know what kind of rent levels he has in mind. Therefore, I applaud what happened at Mansfield on Friday night, when these local authorities met and decided to do as they will do. I applaud, also, the actions of my colleagues on the Clay Cross Urban District Council who are making it clear already that if he wants to get 50 pence out of the Clay Cross Council tenants he must get ready to send his housing commissioners to fetch it, and if they do turn up at Clay Cross they will have some difficulty in getting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the Minister, both in his general statement and in answering questions and interventions, I do not think that any of us on this side can be satisfied that we really got the kind of information that would justify us not pressing this Amendment. We did not get clarity with regard to the issue of the surpluses that would be going into the subsidy system. We had a figure quoted which to me is a joke, and no doubt we shall return to that at a later stage. Frankly, I do not believe the £30 million surplus for 1975–76 that was quoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We got no information whatsoever with regard to the Government's intentions on expansion in investment except, again, a general assurance that this should rise, which flies in the face of the very figures that have been published in the public expenditure White Paper within the last few days, which show, if anything, a drop in public investment. Yet the Minister in the Government which is responsible for this document says that he expects that there will be an expansion, although he quotes us no figures at all. The figures show that there will be a decline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We were not asking questions about the total overall housing programme. In any case, the private sector is not a programme; nobody programmes it except the individual builders. We are here dealing with the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we had no assurances about information on need and subsidy and financing at local authority level individually or collectively, which is germane to these two Amendments. I shall not discuss the matter all over again; no doubt there will be some discussion on the "Clause stand part" debate, but since the Minister has already indicated, for reasons which I do not understand, that he and his colleagues intend to resist the Amendments—so be it; we will vote in favour of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I put this point seriously to him. Although the Government may resist these Amendments, will they please consider putting into the Bill at some suitable stage, even if we cannot get it by Amendment now, an undertaking that there will be an annual examination of this matter, such as now exists under the present subsidy Act? Every year, as the Minister knows, he or one of his colleagues in the Government has to come to the House and indicate what the representative rate of interest under the 1967 Act is to be for the forthcoming year, which gives an opportunity to the Members on either side— and, indeed, to the public—to see annually where we may or may not be going on housing in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government will not accept these sensible Amendments, at least may we have some indication from them, when they have given a little thought to the matter, that they will at least consider the possibility of some other way of getting this kind of annual look at what is happening under the new subsidy structure, nationally and locally, when the Bill, in whatever form, becomes law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a particularly important Clause because it is the only Clause which mentions all the new subsidies. This sample provides us with the most obvious opportunity of comparing the total picture as it would exist under the new proposals with the total picture as it exists now and would have existed under the present arrangements. That is why it is a Clause of quite exceptional importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave us a number of figures which were entirely new to us, and which were very welcome, of the likely cost of individual subsidies. These figures we shall read in Hansard and consider carefully. On the other hand, he was not
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
quite so successful in answering all the queries put by the Opposition. He sprayed us with a good number of figures at particular points in his speech, but I am not certain, by any manner of means, that all our essential queries were properly answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This raises the point mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington, North (Mr. Latham) as to whether we could not have a memorandum giving a number of more detailed figures. At the very least, I ask the Minister to read the report of this morning's proceedings, to go through all our questions, and try to help when he replies to this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of the Clause and its discussion is what the total subsidy bill will be, taking all the subsidies mentioned in the Clause 1, and how that total will compare with the total of subsidies as they would have been had present subsidy arrangements continued. In other words, the crux of the matter is what the cut in total subsidies is likely to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had only one figure, which has played a considerable part in our discussion this morning, and that is the figure given on page vii of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. It says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the result of the provisions of the Bill, annual total net charges on the Consolidated Fund … are estimated to remain at about the estimated level of such charges for 1971–72 (£350m.), at current prices …"</p></blockquote>
I should like to make one comment, following some others, on this figure of £350 million, because the uninformed or uninitiated might easily imagine that this is the total under present arrangements of actual municipal housing subsidies, that this was the total amount by which the local authority housing sector was subsidised by the Government. Of course it is nothing of the sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many of my hon. Friends have pointed out, at least half of this £350 million consists of rent allowances by the Supplementary Benefits Commission, and these have nothing specifically to do with council housing, because the Commission also pays rent allowances to private tenants below a certain income level and those pay-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
ments will continue under the new arrangement. So we are dealing with a gross figure of £350 million which has two distinct elements direct Government help to the council house sector as such and an aspect of any Government's programme for dealing with poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the figure will remain broadly constant until 1975–76. Does that also apply to the two separate parts of the figure? This was not made clear in the Minister's speech. One could imagine a situation in which within a constant £350 million the supplementary benefits part was rising rapidly and yet the actual housing subsidy part was falling rapidly. My specific question is whether it is also the case that not only will the total remain broadly constant until 1975–76, but so will the two separate component parts, so that the constant total figure does not conceal a more dramatic climb in the housing subsidy than might have been envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is a small one and I am certain that the Minister will be able to reassure me. I raised the matter with him at one of our housing debates in the House in July. The figure of £350 million is described as being "at current prices". I always find it extraordinarily hard to comprehend or remember how "current prices" as opposed to "constant prices" as opposed to "real terms" works out, but I should like to be reassured about what I think to be the case, which is that if between now and 1975–76 there is an inflation of 10 per cent., the figure of £350 million will automatically rise by 10 per cent. Otherwise, we should be having a cut simply by the process of inflation, and I cannot believe that it is the Government's intention to impose an additional cut of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third comment relates to the years after 1975–76. We are told that the £350 million figure will remain constant until then. But we are also told on page vii of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum that this figure may be reduced after 1975–76.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the Bill was published there had been, as far as I know, no hint of an absolute reduction, even in the present level of subsidies—I shall come to what subsidies would have been—and the Secretary of State on Second Reading, answering my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
(Mr. Frank Allaun) about reducing the subsidy said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is no reduction in the subsidy at all."</p></blockquote>
He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The present subsidy levels are being maintained, and, therefore, the intervention was completely and utterly ill-founded."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th November, 1971; Vol. 826, c. 35]</p></blockquote>
But we now discover that it was not ill-founded because even the present level of subsidies may be reduced from 1975 to 1976 onwards and so my third question relates to this possible reduction thereafter in even the existing level of subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to what is the major cut, and that is the cut in the likely subsidy level under these proposals as compared with what it would have been supposing existing policies had continued. There is no disagreement about the figures, as I understand it. The right hon. Gentleman repeated the Written Answer he had given to my hon. Friend on 24th November— that had there not been a change in policy, subsidies, or the net charge on the Consolidated Fund, would have been £200 million more in 1975–76.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also gave a figure that I have not heard before and that was remarkably high. Projecting the calculation still further, he said that in 1980–81, if existing policies had continued, the subsidies bill would have been higher by £400 million to £500 million. This is a much higher figure than that quoted in the White Paper. The White Paper quotes £300 million, and that includes rate fund contributions, £300 million being the difference at the end of the decade between what will be and what would have been. The figure of £400 million to £500 million is much larger than any we have heard so far, and it certainly greatly strengthens our case for saying that the charge in subsidy arrangements, the change in the total as apart from the distribution, will be major and dramatic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot seriously be pretended that this is not a cut. We are speaking of what will be as compared with what would have been. After all, even under the present Government we shall have some more council houses built, and we shall have more council house tenants than we have now. Therefore, a given amount of money will mean less money per council house and less money per council tenant. In other words, there is a clear cut for each house and each tenant, and subsidies for council

	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
houses will be cut as a proportion of the gross national product and something else will gain as a proportion of the gross national product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is seriously maintained that it does not amount to a cut to hold the level constant against a rising number of houses and a rising gross national product, let us consider it from the point of view of tax relief to the owner-occupier. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the total of tax relief to owner-occupiers, now running at a little over £300 million, was to be maintained between now and the end of the decade, would it seriously be argued that that was not a cut? Of course it would be a cut, because we are to build more owner-occupied houses, and the consequence of maintaining a constant figure would be that every owner-occupier would be receiving less tax relief than if no such stabilisation had taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there is no question but that we are discussing what is a real cut in the total of housing subsidies. Incidentally, I do not propose at this moment to go into whether tax relief to the owner-occupier can be described as a subsidy. The hon. Member for Epping has not understood the position, but there will be other opportunities to come back to it. Nevertheless, as total subsidies to the public sector are being broadly maintained at £350 million for the next decade, it is of great public interest to know what the total figure of tax relief for the owner-occupier will be in 1975–76 and at the end of the decade, in 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister surprised me by quoting— I regret to say that I had not seen the Financial Secretary's answer—the Financial Secretary to the Treasury saying that any such estimate would be quite unreliable. But it must be possible to give some kind of estimate. After all, the Government must have some idea of how many more owner-occupied houses they
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
hope and expect to be built. As my hon. Friend rightly said, one cannot programme this number: it depends on building societies, private buyers, private builders, and so on. Nevertheless, it should be possible to make some estimate of the likely number of owner-occupied houses in 1975–76. Assuming present tax rates for the sake of the calculation, it should be possible to give at any rate a rough idea, and we want some idea to see what kind of equity or lack of equity we are producing between tenants and owner-occupiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me repeat, as so many of my hon. Friends have said, as I have myself, that we do not ask these questions in a spirit of animosity to the owner-occupier, particularly those on lower incomes, but in order to ensure a reasonable fairness, to use the words of the hon. Member for Epping, between the two sets of occupier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Member and his colleagues between now and in the next two or three decades expect that if there were permanently a Labour Government, mere would be a growth in the proportion of people who would embark on owner-occupation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crosland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered that in the House in response to the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), who showed himself very ignorant of housing. Although he was a Grimbarian, it does not seem to have improved his education. I have not the slightest doubt, looking ahead, that we shall have an increase in the proportion both of owner-occupation and of council tenancies, and the reason is simple—that the private rented sector, which still amounts to 15 per cent, of total housing, is highly unlikely to remain at that figure. Indeed, quite apart from whether we like it—there would be a difference between the two sides of the Committee—it is also the view of most people concerned with the private rented sector that unless there is some dramatic change in taxation arrangements, it would be surprising if it remained at even the present figure of 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But whatever the figure for tax relief is, I must ask the Minister to press his hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to see whether it is impossible to give some estimate of the likely totals for 1975–76. Whatever that figure is, owner-occupiers will not suffer the kind of cut in total aid, subsidies, whatever we call it, that the council tenant will suffer under the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V006P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
On the contrary, the gap between the treatment of the two will widen dramatically as the years go by, as the one figure of aid is held constant and the other rises year by year with the growing number of owner-occupied houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, was surprised by the Minister's figure of only some £30 million of gross surpluses by 1975–76. This is much lower than most of the guesses by outside experts who have written on the subject, and it seems extraordinarily low if we consider, as I pointed out on Second Reading, that when the fair rent process has been completed, we shall have a total rate of income from the local authority sector of about £500 million larger than it is today, and that is if we accept that it will be only doubled. If it is to be more like two and a half times the present rent, rather than double, that figure of £500 million will have to be upped. I find it hard to reconcile with any calculations that I have seen the fact that out of this £500 million of additional rent income only £30 million will accrue as surpluses in housing revenue accounts, which then are impounded by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This subject of the surpluses is so crucial
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
to the whole Bill that we shall want to pursue how the figure of £30 million was reached and whether it is consistent with various other calculations. But, even if the figure is only £30 million, which is a great deal lower than expected, I must repeat how strongly we object to the principle of taking surpluses from housing revenue accounts into the Exchequer and using them as one method of helping the poorer areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some discussion about what represented a tax and what did not. If tenants in parts of the country are paying a rent higher than the cost of their houses, in other words, are paying what my hon. Friend has called a "profit" rent, and part of that profit is going to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I do not see how one can avoid calling that a tax, an additional tax on council tenants in part of the country at any rate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
