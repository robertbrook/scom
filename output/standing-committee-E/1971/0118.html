<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this Amendment we are taking Amendment No. 74, in page 108, line 29, leave out from beginning to end of line 21 on page 109 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>(2) The local authority may dispose of the surplus by using it for any of the following purposes—
<ol>
<li>in payment of a further rebate in rents of its dwellings in such manner as it thinks fit;</li>
<li>in payment of the local authority's costs of administering its rent rebate scheme under Part II of this Act for the year;</li>
<li>by financing capital expenditure for housing purposes in order to reduce the local authority's recourse to borrowing;</li>
<li>by accelerating repayment of capital already borrowed for housing purposes;</li>
<li>by repaying to its tenants or any of them in such manner as it thinks fit a proportion of the capital cost of their respective dwellings, being not greater than the amount which the local authority calculates has been repaid by a tenant in his rent;</li>
<li>in payment of the costs of improvement to its dwellings or provision or improvement of amenities provided for its tenants;</li>
<li>for any other purpose connected with the provision of housing and associated amenities;</li>
<li>by payment to its general rate fund.</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Crosland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We resume our discussion on Amendments Nos. 73 and 74, which are the major Amendments relating to the surplus. In practice, the major debate upon the principle of the surplus appears to be taking place upon these two Amendments
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 570</span>
rather than upon the Question, That the Schedule stand part of the Bill.<br><br>
The surplus is built up as a result of all the changes in subsidies, rebates and allowances, so we must see the total picture of all three if we are to see how it is accumulated and what its effect is. I begin by quoting from an article in the Local Government Chronicle of 7th January, by its Financial Editor, Mr. George Forster. He says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Proceedings on the Housing Finance Bill resemble a British rather than a tropical dawn: the light comes slowly, illumination is gradual, and not always distinct."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be a major understatement:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is fair neither to Parliament nor to local authority advisers that forecasts of financial effects have not been made available, at the outset and in convenient form, of a measure of such complexity and magnitude. The Bill should have been accompanied by a White Paper."</p></blockquote>
That echoes what we on this side have said repeatedly since the start of our debates. However, in the absence of a White Paper, we must do our best to summarise the Bill's arithmetic as we painfully drag the information out of the Minister at sitting after sitting. Only so can we assess how the surplus is built up and what will be the consequences.<br><br>
I start with housing subsidies strictly—not with subsidies related to need, poverty, or the maintenance of incomes, but to those which go to help the housing programme. I take the year 1975–76, which throughout our debates has been taken as the mean year, and, where the Minister has given brackets, I take the middle figure. In 1975–76, the total of housing subsidies is £100 million, as shown in c. 115 of the Official Report of our debates. It is made up of the residual subsidy of £5 million, the transition subsidy of £10 million, the operational deficit subsidy of £15 million, the slum clearance subsidy of £15 million—incidentally, a much smaller figure than one would have imagined from the extravagant claims made for this subsidy in Ministerial speeches—and the rising costs subsidy of £55 million.<br><br>
As the Financial Memorandum tells us, the figure of £100 million may decline still further after 1975–76. and we know that some of these subsidies will disappear in succeeding years since some are purely transitional. Even the others will probably be abated as rent income
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0318">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 571</span>
and local authority surpluses grow. Therefore, the figure of £100 million overstates the position as it is likely to be in the years after 1975–76.<br><br>
We therefore have £100 million of subsidies going to housing, as opposed to need, in 1975–76. In order to compare this with the present position, let us ask ourselves what today's position is.<br><br>
In 1970–71—the latest figures we have—total Government housing subsidies were £157 million. As we are frequently reminded, 10 per cent. of these went to cover the cost of rebates and the remaining total of about £140 million represented the strict housing subsidies. Therefore, we have a likely figure of £100 million in 1975–76 compared with £140 million even today, though, with a house building programme for the public sector of any decent and reasonable size, the present figure of £140 million would have risen sharply.<br><br>
Under the Bill, we shall have a housing subsidy of £100 million in 1975–76, as compared with a figure much greater than £140 million had the present system of subsidies continued. As a result, we have a cut of £40 million even on the present figure, and a much larger cut on the figure which would have been achieved had we continued with the present system.<br><br>
It is, of course, here that the Minister will achieve by far the greater part of the £200 million cut in subsidies as compared with what would have been paid under the present system. In c. 84 of the Official Report he quoted the figure of £200 million, and it has been repeated more than once since. After all, he cannot achieve his £200 million saving out of the rebates and allowances part of the subsidy bill since, with fair rents as high as they will be, we shall have to spend a good deal more public money on rebates, allowances, supplementary benefit payments and so on. The greater part of the £200 million will therefore come from a cut in the building subsidy part of the total subsidy bill.<br><br>
What will the consequences be? The first and most obvious will be a transfer of up to £200 million from the council housing sector to the national taxpayer and, as a consequence of this transfer, there will, I believe, be a further decline in public sector house building. Indeed,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 572</span>
the White Paper on Public Expenditure, to which we have referred more than once in our debates, makes it clear that in 1975–76 there will be a decline in public sector house building even in relation to the figure for 1970–71, which both sides of the Committee agreed was too low.<br><br>
It is worth noting that the most recent figures produced by the Department of the Environment show that in the third quarter of last year starts in the public sector were down 18½ per cent. on the third quarter of the preceding year. They were the lowest that I can trace since 1961. Starts in the public sector of housing are now lower than at any time for over a decade. That is the background against which we are discussing what will be a drastic cut in Government help to the council house sector.<br><br>
The first effect of Part I, leading up to the surplus in Schedule 1, will therefore be a drastic cut in subsidies, a large redistribution of income from council tenants to the national taxpayer and, consequently, a fall in public sector house building when we desperately need a rise.<br><br>
I turn now from housing subsidies—subsidies to aid building—to those intended to relieve poverty and need and to maintain income. Again, I take 1975–76, and middle figures where a bracket has been given by the Minister. Most of my figures have been taken from cc. 430 and 458 of our debates before Christmas.<br><br>
The total payments made for the relief of need under fair rents are enormous, because fair rents are so high. We shall have Supplementary Benefit Commission payments of £80 million in 1975–76, we shall have private rent allowance payments of £40 million, and we shall have rent rebate payments of £260 million, of which—and we cleared up this point earlier—some £70 million will be taken over from the Supplementary Benefit Commission. The total payment for the relief of poverty or need or maintenance of income is £380 million—a gigantic total, due to the fact that fair rents are so high.<br><br>
Who pays? Who is responsible for meeting the national problem of millions of tenants whose income is too low to afford fair rents? The Supplementary Benefits Commission will pay the £80 million to which I have referred. The rent allowance subsidy will cover the bulk of the £40 million going to private rent allowances. The rate rebate subsidy will cover £120 million. This adds up to a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 573</span>
total of £240 million to set against the £380 million, which will be the total of rebate, allowance and supplementary benefit payments. The £240 million roughly corresponds to the Minister's figure of £200-£250 million out of the total in that year which will go for the relief of need and the maintenance of income.<br><br>
On top of the Government payment of this £240 million in these ways, rates will cover a further £40 million, making a total of £280 million from public funds, as compared with the payments which will have to be made of £380 million. In other words, we are left with a gap of £100 million, and this is what will be paid by the council tenants out of their fair rents. Council tenants will be taking over from the national taxpayers £100 million of the costs of relieving low incomes.<br><br>
It is this situation which has created the fury in the local authority world. I quote again—it is a recent quotation, and there have been many others—from the Local <i>Government Chronicle</i> of 7th January:
<br><blockquote><p>"No wonder that it is here, and in connection with rent allowances, that the local authority associations are most dissatisfied. To shift burdens from the Exchequer in respect of assistance to low-inoome tenants, on to the shoulders of other local authority tenants appears to be indefensible…'</p></blockquote>
Let us see where we have got to now as we lead up to the surplus described in Schedule 1. The council tenants have paid their ordinary taxes, like everybody else. They have paid their ordinary rates, like everybody else. They have saved the taxpayer up to £200 million on housing subsidies, and over most of the country they are paying the full cost of their own council housing. They have contributed £100 million to help their poorer fellow citizens—first, the poorer citizens in council houses and then the poorer tenants in private houses.<br><br>
But we have not finished yet. Over much of the country, on top of all that, they will contribute a surplus, which the Minister has put at some £30 million in 1975–76, although it is worth noting that at this time we shall begin to see the Government's policies unfolding. If this Government were to stay in power, this year would be far from being the end of the road: this £30 million surplus would grow rapidly in the years after 1975–76.<br><br>
Of that surplus, part goes to relieving
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 574</span>
the national taxpayer, once again—in other words, we should take £15 million off the figures which I have been given for the cost of subsidies from the Government—and the other part goes to relieving the ratepayer and paying for benefits of concern to the whole local community, because even the half that is paid back to the local authority is not paid back to the housing revenue account but to the general rate fund, thereby relieving the ratepayer of expenditure which strictly should fall on the whole community and not just on the body of council tenants in that area.<br><br>
This is a fantastic turnabout from the situation that most people imagine exists in council housing today. Far from the council tenant being universally subsidised, as many people wrongly imagine he is today, the better off of my council tenants in Grimsby, for example, after paying the full historic cost of the council housing in Grimsby, will pay for the rent rebate to their less well off neighbours and then rent allowance to private rented tenants in Grimsby. On top of that, the Government have now introduced, for the first time in our history, the concept of a landlord's profit into public sector housing. We are now to have a strict landlord profit in council housing.<br><br>
The result of this will be that the council tenant will produce this landlord's profit, part of which goes to relieve the local rates—in other words, we have here a system of double rating only of the council tenant—and the other half goes to the national Exchequer to relieve the national taxpayer. There is a form of double taxation on the council tenant. This is really what the surplus which we are discussing in Schedule 1 amounts to. For the first time in our social history we have the imposition of double rating and double taxation for the council tenant, and the amounts will go far beyond the figures which we are discussing for 1975–76.<br><br>
In passing, I should say that this is an extraordinary contrast with the position of the owner-occupier who, far from paying a double tax—that is to say, his ordinary taxes and another housing tax—is actually receiving, with the agreement of both sides of the Committee, a universal subsidy from the Exchequer.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
How does the Minister justify this remarkable new principle which is being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0320">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 575</span>
introduced into council housing and which has never been properly discussed in this Committee? Sometimes he says that that is not really happening at all. He argues that because fair rents will be lower than market rents the council tenant is still being subsidised—an argument, incidentally, that he does not use about the owner-occupier when he talks about tax relief. But, of course, ignoring that, his argument will not stand up, because over much of the country the scarcity element in fair rents will not be of any significance; it will be of significance only in the areas of greatest stress. Therefore, over the greater part of the country, geographically, fair rents and market rents will be broadly the same, and this alleged element of subsidy will not exist.<br><br>
Then the Minister produces an even more remarkable justification for this state of affairs which appears in paragraph 64 of the White Paper:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Exchequer will relieve ratepayers of most of any deficits in the Housing Revenue Account and initially of the whole cost of rent allowances. The Government therefore considers that the Exchequer should share in any surplus arising in that Account".</p></blockquote>
It is really the most monstrously dishonest argument to try to give the impression that the Government are now giving so much additional help to council housing that they deserve a right in the surplus at a time when the burden on the rates is to remain broadly unchanged, according to the Financial Memorandum, at a time when Government subsidies are to be cut by anything up to £200 million as compared with what they would otherwise have been, and at a time when the sole relief to deficits on the housing revenue account will come from council tenants in the form of higher rents—in other words, when the Government are drastically cutting their help and commitment to council housing.<br><br>
To say then that they are morally entitled to share in a surplus to which they have contributed nothing and in which they have no rights, a surplus which is solely due to the imposition of a much higher and highly inequitable level of council rents, is a highly hypocritical argument. It is interesting to think what this argument would lead to if it were applied to the whole sector of owner-occupation; if the Government were to argue that the total tax relief which they give to the owner-occupier justifies them in some-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 576</span>
how sharing in the surplus that the owner-oecupier receives, but naturally we do not hear anything about that.<br><br>
The Minister says that this whole new system, including the surplus, is justified by the massive redistribution of aid towards the areas of greatest need which is allegedly taking place under the Bill. But, unfortunately, one of the outstanding and depressing features of all the debates we have had so far on the Bill has been that we have scarcely been able to find a single area outside inner London which will gain significantly from this alleged redistribution of help to the areas of greatest need. Again and again we have been given figures from Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Swansea and other places suggesting that this redistribution is largely a myth and that no substantial extra gain will go to any area, whatever its housing needs, outside inner London.<br><br>
It is true that we have found a great deal of redistribution that will go on under the Bill. It is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Mc-Bride) has frequently reminded us, redistribution from low wage, low rent areas to more prosperous high rate areas; from areas with a large stock of rented housing to areas with a much lower stock and, proportionately, much more owner occupation, and, above all, from the council tenant to the national taxpayer. However, what all these forms of redistribution have in common is that they are all in the wrong direction.<br><br>
None of these justifications is the real reason why this concept of a surplus and the whole concept of fair rents and the change in subsidy is being introduced. The real motives are to improve the competitive position of private housing and to reduce the part played by public sector housing. This came out perfectly clearly in the notorious speech of the Secretary of State to the Housing Research Centre conference in 1969 when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The ratio of council housing is much too high at the present level of wages".</p></blockquote>
It is that statement of his, that policy of his, which is embodied in the provisions of the Bill. The Government believe that the proportion of council housing should decline and the Bill, with the concept of a surplus and the double taxation, is a deliberate attempt to weaken the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0321">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 577</span>
competitive position of the public sector of housing against the private sector. That is the first essential motive.<br><br>
The second essential motive is to save large sums of public expenditure by a huge cut in the total of housing subsidies as compared with the present system. The third essential motive, which is really the means by which the other two objectives are to be achieved, is to impose the principle, for the first time, of an additional rate and an additional tax on council tenants, over and above the ordinary rates and the ordinary taxes which they pay along with any other citizen. In other words, this introduces the principle of double rating and double taxation on the council tenant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman will give way—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crosland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to what I think the hon. Gentleman wants to say. I am very surprised that these new principles of taxation of the public sector of housing have not been mentioned or discussed by any hon. Members opposite, with the exception of, I think, one brief and somewhat timid intervention by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison). There are hon. Members opposite who are deeply concerned with the total housing picture in the country, including the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Raymond Gower). The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Allason), a colleague of mine on the executive of the Town and Country Planning Association, is deeply concerned with these matters, as are hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Paddington, North (Mr. Latham), who have acute housing problems in their areas. I find it very surprising that scarcely any of these have sought to discuss this basic change in the principle of public sector housing which we are now talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A few moments ago the right hon. Gentleman emphasised that his party and he himself supported the idea of an extension of owner occupation. Do the right hon. Gentleman and his party not look forward to a time when a much larger proportion of our people have the benefit of owner occupation? Is it not a necessary corollary that there should be some diminution in the number of those who live in other kinds of housing?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 578</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crosland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest to the hon. Member that the answer, which I gave to the House on Second Reading, is this. I am sure that the future housing picture, like the housing picture over the last 25 years, will be characterised, whether the Government like it or not, by a continued and substantial decline in the private rented sector of housing. This means that we shall want a higher proportion of both owner occupation and public sector housing, in order to make good what I regard as being the inevitable further decline in the very large amount of private rented housing, which is still 15 per cent. of the total.<br><br>
I am surprised that no comment has been forthcoming from hon. Members opposite on this major change of principle, but whether or not we have any support from them, our opposition to these new principles, embodied and crystallised in the concept of a surplus, is quite implacable. We shall vote very firmly against these changes when we vote on the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Allaun</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have just heard a very powerful case. It has put the question more adequately than it has been put in all the previous sittings. It confirms our charge, which the Government have admitted, that they intend to reduce housing subsidies by up to £200 million a year, compared with what they would have been by 1976.<br><br>
I agree very strongly with what my right hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland) said, and only want to make one additional point. At the present time, because of a feature I shall mention, there is no need to increase rents. This is an unnecessary step. The most serious charge on council revenue accounts is the interest burden. The City of Manchester is paying £10 million a year in interest on housing loans. By great good fortune, interest rates last year went down everywhere.<br><br>
Before the Government take too rapid credit for this, I must point out that it is partly due to the fact that they are in such difficulties with unemployment that, as a means to restoring employment—and I agree with this—they have reduced interest rates throughout the country, with tremendous benefit to local authority revenue accounts. I could name some councils which might have had to increase their rents, but which have not had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0322">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 579</span>
to do so, because of the reduction in interest rates.<br><br>
I therefore suggest that the whole business is unnecessary, and that many councils strongly resent having to raise their rents when their revenue accounts are in balance or in surplus. This is the position. To increase rents at the moment, when it is becoming unnecessary in many councils, is iniquitous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Stoddart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland). I want to emphasise that great concern is felt by many local authorities about the Bill and what it means in terms of loss of control of their housing revenue accounts and their power to fix rents. Local authorities are also concerned that they are being forced, for the first time, to do things that they have never done before, such as contributing to housing rents from the rates, and also to rent allowances, to subsidise private landlords. They take it very hard that this Government, who, before the election, were preaching about freedom for local authorities, are now, far from granting more freedom, putting greater chains around local authorities, in other aspects as well as the Housing Finance Bill.<br><br>
It adds insult to injury when local authorities, who will be made to contribute from their rate funds to their housing revenue accounts and to rent allowances, are also told that any balances they hold—or part of such balances—are to be handed over to the Minister or to the Exchequer. Many of them are very concerned about their present balances, which will be carried forward into the next year.<br><br>
The borough treasurer of the town in which I live made a report recently to the housing committee. I will quote from that report to show the difficulties faced by that housing committee, after hearing the borough treasurer's report as to what should happen to the £500,000 balance which it was likely to have at the end of this financial year.<br><br>
The borough treasurer's report stated, in relation to the present surplus on housing revenue account:
<br><blockquote><p>"Whatever the committee decides regarding Fair Rent levels … unless additional action is taken, some payment will have to be made
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 580</span>
to the Department of the Environment for 1972–73."</p></blockquote>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
In the White Paper certain suggestions were made as to how the surplus could be disposed of by March 1973.<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"In view of the anticipated deficits in future years, it is desirable that any action should not involve a continuing commitment, and could include any of the following: (a) Increase the level of repair expenditure, being of direct benefit to tenants who, as a group, have contributed to this surplus (as well as to incoming tenants). In the current year £152,000 was spent on repairs by the end of October, out of the revised allocation of £323,000."</p></blockquote>
The borough treasurer was therefore telling the committee that it might be difficult to increase the amount on this plan because of the physical difficulties involved in any one year. The borough treasurer went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"(b) Apply to the Government for sanction to make revenue contributions to capital schemes in excess of the prescribed maxima of £1,000 a scheme. There is no guarantee that any such sanction would be forthcoming although there is a suggestion in the Bill that improvements may be allowed to be financed in this way, and regulations will probably clarify the position. Such action would benefit some present tenants and all future tenants, and also the long term saving and debt charges would reduce the future Rate Fund Contribution.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) Make a special repayment to the Consolidated Loans Fund; the ultimate benefit being to the Rate Fund by the reduction of future Housing Revenue debt charges by about £7,000 for every £100,000 repayment, and accordingly the Rate Fund Contributions."</p></blockquote>
The borough treasurer went on,
<br><blockquote><p>"However, the following actions mentioned in the Joint Report would not now appear to be appropriate:
<ol>
<li>The granting of an additional rent-free week in the current year, although legal, would not be in the interests of the tenants, as the Bill provides that any rent reduction granted since the publication of the White Paper, for however short a period, must be re-imposed on the tenants in 1972/73 in addition to the compulsory rent increases that must be made."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I query that recommendation. Is the Borough Treasurer of Reading correct, or is it possible for any local authority which is not reducing rents to make a rent-free week or a number of rent-free weeks available to tenants to enable them to get rid of some of the surpluses at present on the housing revenue account? I hope the Minister will answer this question because it is a matter of importance to a number

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 581</span>
of local authorities. The borough treasurer continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"The acceleration of debt repayments by a permanent adjustment of the rate of repayment would be an additional burden in future deficit years."</p></blockquote>
it is clear that local authorities do not know whether they are coming or going.<br><br>
The Minister may be pleased that in spite of everything that this Tory council has heard about the Housing Finance Bill in spite of the need to increase rents, perhaps unnecessarily, and in spite of the need to hand over premises, it still accepts the principles of the Bill. I had the opportunity last Tuesday of debating this issue with the councillors concerned at a council meeting, when we heard their reasons for supporting the Bill, and the Minister may be interested to hear some of the points they made. He may then be convinced that some of his supporters in the country are just as confused about the Bill as he obviously is.<br><br>
We were surprised to hear the chairman of this Tory housing committee suggest that the Bill was perfectly all right because, after all, the houses did not belong to the local authority but to the Minister. This is a new concept, no doubt quickly thought up by the chairman, presumably in defence of the Minister.<br><br>
Another councillor thought that a reduction in interest rate would result in a reduction in rent, and he praised the Government for this. This poor sap did not realise that under this Bill, in spite of a reduction in interest—it would be possible, under normal circumstances and without the Bill, for local authorities at least to stabilise, if not reduce, their rents—the council could no longer reduce rents. He did not know that the Minister was in fact telling him that he must increase rents. This has come as rather a shock to some of these people because they expected to be able to stabilise or decrease rents in order to hold on to a few more seats. But the Minister has taken that possibility away from them.<br><br>
Another chap had attended a weekend conference which had been addressed by an hon. Gentleman opposite or a hack from Central Office. This chap was so confused that he understool that rents, far from being increased under the Bill, would be reduced.<br><br>
The Minister will, I hope, appreciate the confusion that the Bill is causing throughout the country and in the various
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 582</span>
local authorities. There can be no doubt about this and last Tuesday I was horrified at the complete ignorance of Tory councillors as to exactly what this Bill will mean to them and the local authorities which they allegedly serve but which they obviously do not.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sal-ford, East (Mr. Frank Allaun) referred before the recess to rent allowances. He rightly said that these allowances were not going to tenants but to landlords and that ratepayers and taxpayers would not help the tenants of privately-rented property. They would help the landlords, he said. This is absolutely true. The tenants, far from getting any benefit, will have their rents increased and will be mere collecting agencies for their landlords, who will be receiving the subsidies.<br><br>
Council tenants, who have in large measure been responsible for building up our existing stock of houses through the rents they pay, part of which are in respect of interest, are now, in addition to assisting their worse off colleagues in council houses, being called upon to pay additional rent to subsidise the private landlord. Need one wonder at the terrific leap in property shares and question why people are trying to get into property, and why, for their superannuation funds, local authorities are buying property bonds and investing in property to the greatest extent possible? They know perfectly well that there will be a big boom in property if and when the Bill is passed.<br><br>
We often hear sad stories from hon. Gentlemen opposite about the poor widow who owns one house, who has a controlled tenant and who cannot get enough rent to pay for necessary repairs. But this does not reflect the proper situation. There is no doubt that landlords and property companies know perfectly well what a boom will be engendered by the Bill. One would not mind so much if they desperately needed the cash, but quite obviously, if one looks at the facts—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Tebbit</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have T misheard the hon. Gentleman, or is he really saying that there are no little old ladies owning one house here and there and who are in poverty because in some cases they have been unable to get rents which will even meet the outgoings of their houses? Is he seriously saying that this problem does not exist?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stoddart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0324">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 583</span>
said that the position was represented by the party opposite as being just that. The real position is rather different, indeed quite different, and the people who will gain most out of the Bill are the big property companies. The little widow—there is not all that number of them—will not benefit.<br><br>
The big property companies will do very nicely out of this. Why else did they contribute £8,000 to the Tory Party coffers before the election? They knew that a Tory Government would help them. Now they are getting the payoff. The Bill gives the payoff and will increase the profits of the property companies. Make no mistake about it; it will do so, and they know it. My hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East recently published a copy of the letter sent out by the property companies' organisation which snowed quite clearly that they realised how well they would do out of the Bill, and they are doing very nicely at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stoddart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman had his opportunity to speak. It is a pity that instead of intervening hon. Gentlemen opposite do not rise and make their own speeches. They have been remarkably silent in this debate. Do they have anything at all to contribute to housing? If not they should get out and let those who want to make a contribution to this debate do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will send the hon. Gentleman the letters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stoddart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to mention some of the profits made by some property companies recently. In the case of Alliance Property Holdings, for example, for the year ended 31st March, 1969, gross rents were £1,387,027. In 1970 they were £1,501,357 and their firrh's ordinary dividend was 10 per cent. Not bad at all! We read:
<br><blockquote><p>"Alliance has substantial interests in London and the Midlands. The Chairman, Major Webb, has long been a fan of the 1965 Rent Act."</p></blockquote>
which I agree was introduced by a Labour Government. Indeed, Major Webb did so nicely out of it that he paid himself £12,000 in director's fees.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 584</span>
Then there was London City and West-cliff Properties, which had a gross rental income in 1969 of £2,801,845 and in 1970 of £2,852,403. In 1969 this firm paid a dividend of 10 per cent. and in 1970 a dividend of 12½ per cent. I could go on quoting from these companies' statements, but I will not bore the Committee. These facts clearly indicate that these property companies, which have been doing so well up to now, will be doing a lot better after the passing of the Bill, if it is passed.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
I wish to make one further point in relation to this part of the Bill, and this is about the district audit. Every hon. Member of the Committee will have received a document from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think the hon. Gentleman will find those observations more in keeping with a later part of the Schedule. Perhaps he will make them when we come to the Schedule stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stoddart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. God-man Irvine, and I will leave the matter there for now.<br><br>
Schedule 1, like the rest of the Bill, is thoroughly bad. It will injure local authorities and it will certainly injure council tenants throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eddie Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish, first, to congratulate my right hon. Friend on the telling points he made in such a coherent and commonsense fashion. I am sure that the layman reading the Official Report of his speech will see the logic of the arguments which he and my hon. Friends have been presenting.<br><br>
I am particularly concerned about his comments regarding the responsibilities of council house tenants. Not only have they been asked to pay an equitable rent, a fair rent, for their home, but they are being asked to subsidise their fellow council house tenants. Not only have they been asked to subsidise the poorer private tenants, but any profit which may accrue from their rents will go to the general taxpayer via the Exchequer, and half of it to the general ratepayer.<br><br>
Whose responsibility it is that certain members of the community are unable to pay a fair rent? The Government are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0325">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 585</span>
clearly saying that it is the responsibility of the general council house tenant; that he is responsible for the pensioner on £6 a week or the family man earning £13 or £14 a week and who is unable to pay a fair rent. Both logically and morally the responsibility, both in the public and private sectors, should rest with the Government and society. In other words, financial assistance to these people should come from those who are responsible for that poverty or relative poverty.<br><br>
Is the Minister saying to council house tenants that they are responsible for the poverty or relative poverty of the country and must carry the responsibility for subsidising these poor people? I believe that the Government irrespective of party, and, therefore, the Exchequer, have the responsibility, along with society through taxpayers and ratepayers generally. Any assistance given to alleviate rents which cannot be met by the householder should either come from the Exchequer or from the general ratepayer, but should not be dragged out of the average council house tenant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr. Julian Amery)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In our debates before Christmas the right hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland) asked me whether I could estimate the extent to which the provisions of Part 1 of the Bill might alter the incidence of rates between different parts of the country. He was, I think, voicing a fear that the poorer parts of the country would be subsidising the richer. I cannot give exact figures, but I can say a little about the likely trends.<br><br>
After the first two or three years of the new system, charges on the rates in relation to housing are likely to arise only in London and in certain authorities in the great conurbations. On the other hand, housing revenue account surpluses are likely to arise both in areas which, on the face of it, are reasonably affluent—for example, in prosperous seaside towns—and in areas which, on the face of it, are not affluent; for example, in North-East Lancashire. Part of these surpluses will benefit the Consolidated Fund, they will not benefit the ratepayers of the authorities with housing revenue account deficits. These ratepayers will still meet a part of the deficit so long as the deficit lasts. The major part of the deficits will be met by subsidies, whether any sur-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 586</span>
pluses are paid into the Consolidated Fund or not. The surpluses paid into the Fund make it possible to raise less taxes to meet the cost of subsidies which are paid towards the housing revenue deficit. But the surpluses paid into the Fund benefit the taxpayers at large, both those who pay direct taxes and those who pay indirect taxes.<br><br>
Moreover, many of the authorities which are likely to have housing revenue account deficits for the longest time will be authorities in which the domestic ratepayer already makes an average rate payment which is high in relation to other authorities. Conversely, many of the authorities which are likely to have a surplus very soon will be authorities in which the domestic ratepayer makes an average rate payment which is low in relation to other authorities.<br><br>
For example, in the Inner London Boroughs, average rate payments for 1971–72 are expected to be mainly in the ranges of £70-£90, as against £60-£62 in Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, £45–47 in Oldham, Salford and Gateshead, and the figures for Cardiff, Swansea and Newport are in the £61–£65 range. In the smaller authorities in Derbyshire or North-East Lancashire, which might soon have a housing revenue account surplus, the average rate payment for 1971–72 is estimated to be mainly in the range £23-£35.<br><br>
The one conclusion which seems to emerge is that this is not a case of a subsidy from poor areas to rich areas. It is a very strange cross-current and, if there are any discernible trends, their total effect is likely to be much more complicated and less clear cut than the right hon. Gentleman had suspected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Reginald Freeson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has just been quoting so clearly is that there is no question here of poorer areas subsidising, in the rent surpluses, the richer or more affluent areas of the country. The figures he has quoted, with respect, show nothing of the kind. It is very difficult to follow when so many figures are thrown about in this fashion but, as I understand it the figures that he has been quoting are the figures of average rate payments per year in different parts of the country. The kind of figures he has quoted do not mean that poorer areas will not be paying towards the affluent areas. If areas are paying a lower rate, it is just as likely to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0326">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 587</span>
because they have poor rateable values, lower wages and the like as that they are equal in their resources to the areas which will be receiving contributions from the Exchequer. The figures the right, hon. Gentleman has quoted do not answer the point that has been made about the regional imbalance that might well flow in some parts of the country as a result of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will do me the courtesy of reading carefully in the Official Report what I have said, he will see that there is no clear-cut pattern of the poorer areas subsidising richer areas. There are some very strange cross-currents in this, in some of which the richer areas are subsidising the poorer areas and in some of which it is the converse. There is no clear discernible pattern and that is the point I was trying to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dick Leonard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the purpose of the exercise?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman had put a particular point to me and I was trying to show that there is no clear discernible trend between authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leonard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My question was: what is the purpose of a piece of legislation which, according to the Minister, will produce virtually random movements of payments between one authority and another?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose is to subsidise people and areas in need but not through the rate contribution element, which is what was being suggested by the right hon. Gentleman. In his remarks this morning the right hon. Gentleman talked as if the object of the Bill was to make council tenants pay a special tax, and he indicated that this would be a double tax. The payment of the surplus to the Consolidated Fund for the benefit of taxpayers or ratepayers is not a tax on tenants. It could only be a tax if rents were fixed for the purpose of creating a surplus.<br><br>
Rents are to be based on the value of the dwelling, not on the state of the housing revenue account. If in an authority the fair rents do not create a surplus, surely not even the hon. Gentlemen opposite could speak of a tax. Why, then, should it be at a tax if in another authority the same fair rents do create a surplus? There would be much more sense in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 588</span>
talking about a tax on tenants arising from the present system. If a local authority today builds houses or grants rebates and there is a deficit it often puts up rents so as to elimnate the deficit and avoid the ratepayers making a rate fund contribution.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. McBride) explained to the Committee how the tenants of Swansea paid for the rebates granted to the tenants of Swansea at the present time. He made it clear that this was a deliberate arrangement. In this kind of arrangement the rents are being deliberately increased so as to avoid increasing the local rate. Many authorities use surpluses in the housing revenue account to make good to the ratepayers rate fund contributions made over the last nine years, when they could carry forward the surplus or reduce rents. Surely this is much more like a tax on tenants than what we propose.<br><br>
Amendment No. 74 proposes a number of different ways in which a local authority might have discretion to dispose of a surplus. Although the right hon. Gentleman did not enumerate them all in his remarks this morning, I will, for the record, deal with them. The proposals fall, broadly speaking, into three groups.<br><br>
In the first group the proposal is essentially to use the surplus to reduce the rents of dwellings. Proposals (<i>a</i>) and (<i>e</i>) are in this group. These proposals would enable an authority with relatively low historic costs to reduce the rents of its dwellings below fair rents.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) pointed out, this breaches the principle of fair rents and reintroduces the unfairness of the present system in two ways. First, if the tenants of an authority with a surplus pay less than the fair rent, they will be treated more favourably than the private tenants in that area. This would be unfair. Moreover the unfairness would be harder to justify where the private tenants' fair rent was the market rent, as will tend to be the case in this kind of area in which supply and demand for housing will increasingly balance.<br><br>
Secondly, the tenants of an authority with a surplus would also be treated more favourably than the tenants of an authority with a deficit. This would also be unfair.<br><br>
As the fair rent in deficit authorities, e.g. in London, is likely to be higher than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0327">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 589</span>
the fair rent in surplus authorities, the unfairness would be all the more glaring. The tenants of authorities not in housing stress who could afford the fair rent would be given a wholly unjustifiable advantage over the tenants of authorities in areas of housing stress who could afford the fair rent.<br><br>
Proposal (<i>e</i>) introduces quite a new theory of local authority rents. It suggests that when a council tenant pays rent he is, in fact, buying his house, so that when he has paid a rent equal to the capital cost of the dwelling, no more rent is payable. I was rather excited when I first studied this part of the Amendment. It suggested that the Opposition really believed that rent was a way of buying a house by instalments, and I assumed that they would be coming out with a positive policy advocating the sale of council houses on a very large scale. We have not gone so far. We are all in favour of the sale of council houses, but we have taken the view that rents, whether paid by council tenants or the tenant of a private landlord, is a payment for the occupation of the dwelling. It is not a form of instalment purchase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not such an unusual proposition. It was first introduced by a Conservative Government under the provisions of the Housing Act, 1964 where, under co-ownership schemes, the tenant is treated as buying his house through his rent and when he leaves the property he is entitled to a certain amount of the capital towards which payment of his rent has gone.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has revived my hope that we shall see a massive campaign for the sale of council houses, and I will gladly appear on platforms with the hon. Gentleman to this end.<br><br>
We have not yet gone so far as to suggest that rent is a form of instalment purchase. Even if rent were to be considered a form of purchase, there are formidable, practical difficulties which we would have to resolve in deciding what is due to be repaid, if a dwelling has been occupied by several tenants or if a tenant has, at different times, occupied more than one of the local authority's dwellings.<br><br>
The second group of proposals appears
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 590</span>
to involve using the surplus to offset rate fund contributions towards the cost of administering rent rebates and improvements to council houses. These proposals appear to be based on a misunderstanding. There is no surplus to dispose of until such rate fund contributions cease to be required. So long as rate fund contributions are being made, there cannot be a surplus. There is a surplus only after there is sufficient income in the housing revenue account to make rate fund contributions unnecessary.<br><br>
The third group of proposals, (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>), (<i>g</i>) and (<i>h</i>), have the same effect of paying the surplus into the general rate fund and using the money so paid in for a variety of purposes. These are all purposes for which a surplus paid to the rate fund may be used. The issue is not whether the surpluses should be used for this purpose—good purposes as they are—but whether the whole of the surplus or only a part should be available to the authority for such purposes.<br><br>
The case for letting the Government have a part of the surplus is, I submit, very strong. Under the new system, subsidies are mainly paid towards deficits in the housing revenue account. There is a simple equity in an arrangement whereby whoever meets most of a deficit when it arises also receives a share, a fairly small share, of a surplus when it arises. Under the present system subsidy is not generally related to deficits in the housing revenue account. Only the ratepayers today make substantial contributions towards deficits, so only they, and not the taxpayers, profit from a surplus. A housing revenue account surplus can now be used to make good a rate fund contribution made in the last nine years. Under the new system, both the taxpayer and the ratepayer contributes towards housing revenue account deficits and, therefore, both reasonably obtain the benefit of a surplus.<br><br>
The general rate fund's share of the surplus may or may not be used for housing purposes. It will be available to meet the 25 per cent. of any slum clearance loss which is not met by slum clearance subsidy or for the ratepayers' share of improvement grants. It may be large enough, too, to be available to local authorities for non-housing purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the logic of the right hon. Gentle-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0328">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 591</span>
man's argument. He said that the method of disposing of surpluses suggested in the Amendment would be unfair between one set of tenants and another because, in one case where there was a surplus, the tenant could be the beneficiary, whereas where there was a deficit, the tenant could not be the beneficiary. Could the Minister not apply the same logic to the argument which he now puts forward about the disposal of surpluses, because he seeks to justify a situation in which a ratepayer may benefit from a surplus on the grounds that another ratepayer might be contributing to a deficit?<br><br>
If he wants to apply this basis of equity between tenants in one area and tenants in another, should he not equally apply the same principle of equity to the position of ratepayers in one area and another? In other words, how can he really justify the ratepayer in one district benefiting from a surplus which is created where another ratepayer in another district, a quite different person, is in fact contributing to a deficit? Could he please explain his reasoning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, at the present time ratepayers contribute to the deficit. Indeed they contribute to the total housing revenue account, unless rents are put up to meet the deficit. Under our proposals, the Exchequer will be responsible for 75 per cent., and in some cases more, according to the level of subsidy, for meeting the deficit. We therefore think it only equitable that ratepayers should make a contribution, though not as large a proportion of the contribution as they make at the present time. The share of the Consolidated Fund is certain to be used for housing in the foreseeable future, but it is unlikely that it will ever be larger than the subsidies paid out from the Fund for housing.<br><br>
The argument has been advanced that council houses belong to the ratepayers. This is true, in the sense that title to the houses is vested in the local authority. But most of them would never have been built if there had not been a subsidy available at the time. In many cases the ratepayers never contributed a penny towards the provision or maintenance of the houses in question. Their claim to share the surplus income from the asset is, therefore, scarcely as strong as that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 592</span>
of the taxpayer at large. That is why we say that it is only reasonable that the substantial element of the surplus should be returned to the Exchequer, which has, after all, borne the major burden in providing the houses. For these reasons I ask the Committee to resist the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having in his view disposed of the points in Amendment No. 74, the Minister went on to give the main reasons which the Government have in mind for the Exchequer receiving a large proportion of the surplus. I listened carefully to his comments, but he never once repeated what the Secretary of State said on the Floor of the House in answer to an intervention on Second Reading by my right hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland). The right hon. Gentleman did not once state that it was the intention of the Government to top up any figure of subsidy by the sum received by way of surplus.<br><br>
On the Floor of the House the Secretary of State for the Environment quoted by way of illustration the possibility that there could be a £50 million surplus coming into the Exchequer and that this, or any other such figure of surplus coming into the Exchquer, would be added to, say, £200 million of subsidy. I am curious to know whether it is still the interpretation by the Government of the Bill that any surplus received by the Exchequer should be used as a topping up element. Is this still Government policy?<br><br>
After all, the Government have said on many occasions that they are not proposing any cuts in total subsidies. Globally, the expected subsidy level will, they say, be the same in 1974–75 as it is today; that is, about £200 million. In addition will be added the surplus which is the subject of the debate this morning. That is what the Secretary of State said. I am curious to know why this has not been given as an important percentage element in the Government's reasoning. We are entitled to know whether that statement by the Secretary of State for the Environment was an accurate statement of the position under the Bill. Some of us have serious doubts about that.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman's comments on Amendment No. 74 were far from satisfactory. His arguments about fairness and unfairness in the use of surplus monies as between private tenants and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0329">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 593</span>
local authorities and as between one local authority and another did not hold water. One might as well say that if there are lower rents in one part of the country and higher rents elsewhere in a local authority which still has housing problems, this is unfair whatever the nature of the tenancy, whether it be in the public or private sector.<br><br>
Nobody says that because rents are lower in some parts of the North of England than they are in London it is unfair because it must be related to a whole series of other social and economic factors. Therefore, to suggest that, because a local authority is able to run its estates at a certain level of expenditure and balance that expenditure by a certain level of income from rents which would be below what the Government is proposing, which, as my right hon. Friend has pointed out, is virtually an unsubsidised market rent throughout the country, which would produce a considerable surplus in many areas, it is unfair that local authorities should be able to use those surpluses for purposes other than payment into the Exchequer, including the possible reduction of rents nearer to the cost level, distorts the facts of local authority administration.<br><br>
My main point is that in many respects, if not in all respects, Amendment No. 74 is very much along the lines to which the Government are paying lip service. Everybody today talks about improving the environment. The word is in the title of the Minister's Department. Everybody wants to improve the environment. Under the Housing Act, 1969, which now has the support of both sides of the House, there are grants for this purpose in general improvement areas. What is wrong in allowing local authorities to hold on to a surplus obtained from their tenants in order to improve the environment in their area? Why are the Government so ideologically committed to the tenets of this Bill that they do not even allow for that kind of proposition to be written into the Bill? What is wrong with allowing local authorities to say, "Our area is in need of pre-school playgroups, more trees in the streets, more playgrounds, and a whole range of facilities to improve the quality of life, and we propose to use the money we have obtained under Government instruction in this Bill by way of surplus to do just what the Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 594</span>
say they want to see done throughout the country"?<br><br>
If we permit local authorities to spend monies in this way, we shall help to avoid the need in future years in many areas to increase Exchequer expenditure. There are already the grants per unit of accommodation in general improvement areas declared and accepted by the Ministry—£100 per dwelling shared equally between the rates and the Exchequer. Why not permit local authorities to ease the possible pressures on the Exchequer in future to increase that figure by allowing local authorities to spend the money in the way we propose?<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I touched briefly on the third and last point I want to make when we were discussing the slum clearance subsidy. I said I wished to return to it at a later date, and I wish to make it now as it is closely associated with the surplus. I should like to know from the Minister whether the receipt of surplus by the general rate fund in the appropriate local authorities which are more than in balance on their housing revenue account will influence the negotiations which take place on a regular basis with regard to the rate support grant. This is an important factor.<br><br>
The Green Paper on local government finance is before Parliament and the country. The way in which the Green Paper disposes of the White Paper and the Bill is quite inadequate. This is a major Bill dealing with the expenditure of millions of pounds. The Minister has said that he thinks it will produce a £30 million surplus. There are other estimates from equally reliable quarters in the local government world that it will be hundreds of millions of pounds within a few years. Whatever it is, it is many millions of pounds, and for the Green Paper to have ignored this element of resource in local government finances and to say that it is being dealt with by way of the White Paper, the Bill and this Committee is quite inadequate.<br><br>
This Bill will produce, whatever the exact figure will be as events turn out, a surplus of millions of pounds. The Bill requires that 50 per cent. shall go to the general rates and 50 per cent. to the Exchequer. The Green Paper is the result of an examination of alternative forms

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 595</span>
of generating finance for local authorities so that they will not have to rely, to the same extent as in the past, on a growing volume of central Government help. May we know why, notwithstanding this considered search for alternative sources of income for local authority expenditure, the Government have decided that 50 per cent. of one major additional source which they are creating—that is, the surplus on housing revenue account—shall go to the Exchequer, while, at the same time, they are seeking, by way of the Green Paper and the studies which have led to it and the views they are now seeking from local government sources on that Green Paper, to find additional sources of income for local government? This seems to me to be totally illogical and contradictory.<br><br>
Secondly, if we are to have a provision whereby, as a result of a contribution by council tenants through the surplus to the general rate fund, the Exchequer reduces its contribution to local government fin-</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 79 is out of order, so the next Amendment is No. 80, with which it is convenient to take Amendment No. 92.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. There are two matters on which I should like to seek your guidance, Mr. Godman Irvine, and this may be of help to other members of the Committee. Perhaps the Minister would wish to make a statement on one aspect, and you might be willing to give him the opportunity so to do.<br><br>
I have served on only four Committees of the House prior to this Committee, only one of which had many sittings. Certainly none of those four Committees was faced with the complexities which arise in a Committee dealing with a</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 596</span>
<p>ancing through the negotiations over the rate support grant, because it will argue that there are greater resources now available therefore one can reduce the Exchequer contribution, may we be told whether it is in the mind of the Government to do so and, if so, what consideration will be given to this aspect of the Bill when the Government come to decide on any legislation arising from the Green Paper on Local Government Finance?</p>
<p>Those two points have not been dealt with by the Government, but, in my view, they will take on considerable importance as time goes on if and when the Bill becomes law. I think that local authorities and we in the House are entitled to know what impact the surplus will have on the general rate support grant negotiations and future policy.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the Amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 15, Noes 17.</p>
<p>major Measure of this kind. As I understand the parliamentary process, it is perfectly proper for people affected by proposed legislation to make representations to members of a Committee. In particular those who would be concerned with implementing such legislation avail themselves of the opportunity, whether they have a constitutional right or not, of making approaches to members of the Committee. When a member of the Committee feels that a representation made to him has merit he may table an Amendment in accordance with that representation. I assume that this is proper parliamentary practice and custom. My experience in relation to the Committee and in relation to other matters coming before the House, particularly matters concern-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0331">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 597</span>
ing local authorities, is that a local authority which seeks to amend legislation will usually make its views known, in some instances to all Members of Parliament and in other instances to all the members of a Committee concerned with the detailed consideration of the Bill in question.</p>
<p>One of the largest, most significant and most important authorities affected by this Bill is the Greater London Council. In common with several other members of the Committee, I am a London Member. The effect of this legislation upon the Greater London Council will have an indirect consequence upon all my constituents and will have a particular effect upon those constituents who are tenants of the Greater London Council to the Westminster City Council.</p>
<p>That is the first point on which I ask for your ruling, Mr. Godman Irvine, but I ask you to hear two other points before you rule. In your provisional selection of Amendments notified to the Committee at its last sitting on Tuesday, 21st December, you will recall that you had provisionally selected Amendment No. 75, which has the precise form of wording of an amendment which was drafted by the Solicitors Department of the Greater London Council. I learnt only in the middle of yesterday evening that the Greater London Council had spent a lot of time preparing proposed amendments to this Bill. Later last night I learnt unofficially, and not directly from the G.L.C., of other amendments which had subsequently been drafted by that department of the G.L.C. In consequence, I find that one amendment proposed by the G.L.C, which a number of my colleagues and I subscribed to late last night, was submitted last Friday by the hon. Member for Paddington, South (Mr. Scott).</p>
<p>Amendment No. 75, which you had selected at our last sitting, Mr. Godman Irvine, and Amendment No. 134, which is on your list of provisional selections for today, both deal with an identical aspect of the same Clause. I learn from your selection notified today that Amendment No. 75 has been withdrawn and Amendment No. 134 substituted therefor. The first point on which I ask for your guidance is whether it is usual and proper that an Amendment which has been selected should be withdrawn, with-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 598</span>
out notification to the Committee or the consent of the Committee, and another Amendment—which one would normally expect to have been starred as it was received rather late—should be selected and substituted for the original Amendment.</p>
<p>The second point is this. The Minister has left the Committee, but his deputy may be able to assist us. I had thought it customary that if as important, large and significant body as the Greater London Council felt that Amendments were desired to the Bill all members of the Committee, particularly those representing London constituencies, should have the benefit of knowing the effect of the G.L.C.'s deliberations and representations.</p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p>I do not know whether the long delay, and the fact that I heard only accidentally about this in the last 24 hours, is due to dilatoriness or sloppiness on the part of the G.L.C, or whether approaches were made to the Minister in charge of the Bill. If that is so, I wonder whether you, Mr. Godman Irvine, would permit the Minister to tell us why the Committee, as a whole, has not merely not been acquainted of this approach, but has been allowed to miss the boat in respect of a long list of other Amendments, particularly those relating to Clause 4 and other parts of Schedule 1, which I understand were considered by the G.L.C. many weeks ago, which were drafted by the Solicitors Department and in respect of which there seems to have been a complete breakdown in communications.</p>
<p>I think you will agree, Mr. Godman Irvine, that it is a reasonable supposition that, when we reach Report and Third Reading, we are likely, to use a euphemism, to be under some pressure concerning the passage of the Bill. Therefore, it seems highly improbable that there will be adequate opportunity to consider the detailed and possibly important Amendments which the Greater London Council considers necessary.</p>
<p>It seems that all the work done by the G.L.C. and all the work undertaken by the G.L.C. Solicitors Department has been to no avail. We have learnt of this only by accident and the time has passed when you, Mr. Godman Irvine, could select the Amendments because we have dealt with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0332">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 599</span>
the Clauses in question. Therefore, I should like to know whether you can offer some guidance on the custom and practice about representations being made to all members of a Committee if a body concerned with the implementation of the legislation feels amendment to be essential. I should also like to know whether a brief statement could be made by the Government to indicate whether they have received approaches which have not been conveyed to the Committee or whether the Greater London Council has completely wasted its time because there has been such a long delay and, as far as I am aware, no official communication made.</p>
<p>A minor point arising out of that, Mr. Godman Irvine, is this. Am I right in assuming that the only way in which an outside body may communicate with a Committee considering a public Bill is by making approaches to individual Members? As far as I am aware, there is no procedure for a communication to be sent to, for example, the Clerk or the Chairman of the Committee, as might be the practice under other forms of government.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if you, Mr. Godman Irvine, could deal with the earlier point about the substitution of the selected Amendment and indicate whether there is some machinery by which the G.L.C. amendments could have been notified to us earlier. Perhaps you will also give the Government an opportunity to indicate whether they have failed to convey this point to the Committee or whether the Greater London Council has not exerted itself sufficiently to make the members of the Committee aware of these important matters.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can help the hon. Gentleman. In my experience of Committees, there has never been any difficulty in receiving rather more communications than some of us may find convenient. Therefore, I should have thought that there would be no difficulty in the Greater London Council finding a way by which it could communicate with one or all of the members of the Committee.<br><br>
The fact that Amendment No. 75 was withdrawn is not a matter for me to bring to the notice of the Committee. It is never the custom to tell Members that Amendments have disappeared from the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 600</span>
Amendment Paper and, on occasions, Amendments which have been provisionally selected are not moved by the hon. Member when the time comes to move them. Amendment No. 134 was on the Amendment Paper on Friday, 14th January, and it would have been possible for the hon. Gentleman to have had the good fortune to have found it then and at least to have been aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I accept what you have said about what happened on Friday, Mr. Godman Irvine, but, when Amendment No. 75 was down, some of us looked at it and thought that we would hear what the hon. Member for Paddington, South had to say to justify it before determining whether we wished to support it. We were in the difficulty that all we had was the wording which was exactly the same as that drafted by the solicitors of the Greater London Council, whereas presumably the hon. Member for Paddington, South also had the detailed memorandum which came to our notice last night. Similarly, with regard to Amendment No. 134 when the memorandum was received last night, which, as I say, came about quite accidentally and not through any direct intervention of the G.L.C, some of us put down Amendment No. 149, which has not been selected. It makes no difference because Amendment No. 134 serves the purpose, but I seek to establish whether the Greater London Council has communicated with members of the Committee in addition to the hon. Member for Paddington, South. I do not understand why he is apparently in the privileged position of knowing not only what Amendments the G.L.C. desired to be made but the reasons which it put forward in their support.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 75 and 134 seek to achieve the same objective. Amendment No. 134 has been substituted for Amendment No. 75, but it might be that a number of members of the Committee, including several of us on this side, would prefer the form of Amendment No. 75. How were we to know that an hon. Member who apparently was in the confidence of the G.L.C. and who drafted and put down Amendment No. 75 would exercise the option to withdraw that Amendment when it was one to which others of us would have subscribed had we had the information from the G.L.C. which reached me accidentally last night and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0333">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 601</span>
which was apparently in the possession of the hon. Member for Paddington, South?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I cannot help the hon. Gentleman any further. All I can do is to deal with the situation as it appears from the Amendment Paper. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to hear the arguments on Amendment No. 134 today, perhaps we can proceed with Amendment No. 80, with which we are to take Amendment No. 92.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise your difficulty, Mr. Godman Irvine, but you will appreciate the difficulty in which all members of the Committee find themselves. This is not a matter of difference between the two sides of the Committee because we are dealing with this on a completely nonparty basis. I am wondering whether there is some way by which, even at this late stage, either through appropriate machinery of the House or through the good offices of the Ministry, representations could be made to the G.L.C. expressing our concern. After all, the Greater London Council considers itself, rightly, to be equivalent to the major local authority associations, such as the A.M.C. and the County Councils Association, because of its special character. Is there some way—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The relationship between the Greater London Council and members of the Committee is not a matter for the Chair. I think that we should now proceed with Amendment No. 80.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce Douglas-Mann</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 80, in page 108, line 32, leave out "if no" and insert "whether or not".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can also discuss Amendment No. 92, page 108, leave out lines 36 to 40.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas-Mann</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment is designed to shift the burden of rent allowances from ratepayers to taxpayers. I hope to explore a little further the logic, or illogic, which lies behind the proposals in the Schedule and, in particular, in paragraph 17. We have heard from hon. Members on this side of the Committee, and in particular from my right hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland) and my hon. Friend the Member for Willesden East (Mr. Freeson), a very cogent criticism of the thinking which lies
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 602</span>
behind the principles in this paragraph. I am sorry to have missed the beginning of the Minister's reply as I was out of the room for a few minutes, but I do not think, from what I gather from my colleagues, that he dealt with the arguments we have consistently advanced both in Committee and on Second Reading. [<i>Laughter.</i>] The hon. Member for Epping (Mr. Tebbit), as usual, laughs uproariously but the logic has, as yet, failed to emerge from reading the reports of the Committee's proceedings.<br><br>
The specific point dealt with in the Amendment relates to the payment of rent allowances: I should welcome an explanation from the Minister why this particular subsidy should be exclusively borne by the council tenants and/or the ratepayers and why the Exchequer should not contribute to it if there is a surplus on the housing revenue account in an authority's area. At present, rents in the private sector are presumably substantially lower than they will be as a result of the Bill. In many areas a substantial number of pensioners are receiving assistance with private rents through supplementary benefits, wholly paid for by the taxpayer. As a consequence of the proposals in paragraph 17, that burden will be shifted to the council tenants or ratepayers of any given area, assuming that there is a surplus on the housing revenue account.<br><br>
We have some estimate of the likely level of the surpluses on housing revenue accounts. As has been said, we have had many other much higher estimates from local government authorities throughout the country. It seems likely that in a very large number of areas—indeed, in the majority—there will be a substantial surplus on housing revenue accounts in the very near future, so that, in practice, council tenants will be paying the housing rent allowance for private tenants which is created by the Bill.<br><br>
We should look at the way in which the surplus to be disposed of under the paragraph arises.<br><br>
The Minister has talked as though anybody who is paying less than the maximum amount of rent charged to his house was being subsidised. He has spoken in this way on many occasions.<br><br>
I pay less than the market rent of my house, quite apart from the question of tax allowance on my mortgage. I bought my house many years ago, and therefore I now have an asset which appreciates
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0334">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 603</span>
in value at the rate of 15 per cent. per annum, and I am paying nothing for it. Everybody who owns their own house is in that fortunate situation. I am not paying. I am not contributing. We know that in the course of the last year property values nationally on average, increased by 15 per cent. In the London area and in many other areas it was substantially more, and there were some areas where it was less. But, in general, property values went up by 15 per cent.<br><br>
What is proposed by the Bill is an institutionalisation of inflation. That is, henceforth, quite apart from any subsidies, council tenants and private tenants are to have their rents geared to the annual rate of inflation. There will be some reduction to take account of scarcity factor, but we know that this is likely to be substantially less than the rate of inflation. So rents will be raised sufficiently to ensure that they reflect market rents; and that rents, in general, keep pace with inflation.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
The Minister and the Government have talked as though the inflation of property values was something that took place wholly independently of any action on their part, as though the steps that are proposed in the Bill will not in themselves contribute to the inflation in property values which will result. In my own area, the effects of Part II will accelerate enormously the level of private rents. I know that these increases will, to some extent, be met by rent allowances, and that those rent allowances, under the provisions of the Schedule, are to be paid for almost exclusively by council tenants.<br><br>
Quite apart from the fundamental logic of the Bill, which we have criticised and attacked on many occasions, quite apart from the illogicality of ignoring the inflationary effects that the Bill will have, not only on the problems of those tenants who have to find the money to pay for the increased rents, but on property values, we have the absurdity, the total illogicality, as I see it, of referring to the rent allowances which are to alleviate some of the burden on private tenants who have their rents put up by the provisions in the Bill, will be met solely by other council tenants or by the ratepayers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 604</span>
We know that rates are a regressive tax. The criticism of the collection of revenue from rates from every quarter abounds. I think that the Minister will accept that it is not by any means the most satisfactory form of raising revenue. It is an acceptable form of raising revenue only so long as the total level raised is not too great.<br><br>
The amounts of rates that need to be collected each year tend to increase at a faster rate. Now we have in this proposal a provision that the rent allowances at present paid by supplementary benefits will, in effect, be paid for by rates, and that the burden will be shifted back to the ratepayers and the council tenants.<br><br>
I urge that the Government reconsider these proposals as a whole on the lines that we have been discussing this morning. The whole philosophy of the Schedule is illogical and unsatisfactory. The proposal that the rent allowance should be paid in this way seems to have no justification, and I urge the Minister and Government to reconsider it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Paul Channon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Th effect of the Amendment, if agreed, would be that half of any surplus arising in the local authority's housing revenue account for any year would be paid to the credit of the authority's general rate account, with no prior reduction to meet the amount of rent allowance subsidy payable to the local authority by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The effect would be that the Secretary of State would continue to pay rent allowance subsidy towards a percentage of the standard amount of rent allowance granted by the local authority for the year, even after there was a surplus in the housing revenue account. An additional income, other than from subsidies and rent fund contributions, would become available to meet the housing revenue account deficit arising from the granting of rebates, it would be used to extinguish the deficit. The taxpayers and the ratepayers, as the Bill is drafted, benefit in the proportion to which they had previously met that deficit.<br><br>
I do not expect that the Committee will want me to go through the arguments we had earlier this morning about the whole question of whether there should be a surplus. That is a much wider question. But if one has a surplus, it is logical that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0335">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 605</span>
when additional income is sufficient also to meet the cost of rent allowances it should also inure to the benefit both of the taxpayers and of the ratepayers in the proportion in which they meet that cost.<br><br>
Under the Amendment, the ratepayers would receive 50 per cent. of the surplus while they were not meeting any percentage of the standard amount of rent allowances for any year from 1972–73 to 1975–76, and while they were meeting at most, depending on the position at the time, 20 per cent. of the amount for any year from 1976–77 to 1981–82. As the Bill is drafted, when there is a surplus, the ratepayers receive in proportion to whatever percentage they meet of the standard amount of rent allowances, and the taxpayers whatever percentage they meet.<br><br>
That is the short reason for the Bill being drafted in this form. I could give particular examples if the Committee would like me to, but I am not sure that I should be able to satisfy the hon. Member who has much deeper doubts about the whole Schedule which we discussed at an earlier occasion. Given the Schedule in its present form, and we have discussed it in principle, I think it right to leave the Bill as drafted, for the reasons I have given to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just said that he would not return to the general argument about whether there should be a surplus. Will the hon. Gentleman confine himself to the narrow principle which arising out of the general principle which is a simple question as to why the council tenant should be singled out in these circumstances as the person who has to accept responsibility for subsidising the tenants of private landlords. This is similar to the wider principle, and in its narrower implication it is perhaps easier to understand exactly what the principle is. It is that principle which has to be justified if this Amendment is to be resisted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Channon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member knows full well that I do not accept that that is the effect of the Bill. This is a point of dispute between the two sides of the Committee. The hon. Member and his colleagues assert that it is a principle enshrined in the Bill, but this is not so. As has been said often, it is the tenant
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 606</span>
who pays the fair rent. Whether the housing revenue account of his authority is likely to have a surplus or a deficit makes no difference; he pays a fair rent. It is not the case that the tenant of the local authority dwelling is subsidising the tenants of a private landlord; he pays the fair rent whether or not the housing revenue account is in surplus. It makes no difference what the state of the housing revenue account is at any particular time. This Amendment seeks to decide what should happen to some proportion of the surplus on the housing revenue account, should there be such a surplus. The hon. Member will not expect me to accept the premise on which he bases his assertion, because I do not accept that that is the principle of the Bill, which is that the tenant pays a fair rent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will not the hon. Gentleman accept that whatever label he tries to put on, it is a fact that the money which is coming out of the tenant's pocket is going back into the landlord's pocket. The money is coming from the tenant, and it is being paid to the private landlord. Whatever ingenious arguments the Minister applies it is a fact that the money is coming out of the one pocket and going into the other, and surely there is a need to justify that principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Channon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the principle. The principle governing the Bin is that tenants should pay a fair rent, and if they cannot afford the rent they get a rebate or an allowance from the private sector. Local authority tenants pay the fair rent and what then happens if their authority is in surplus is a matter which the Committee has to decide and we have had a long debate about it. But that does not affect what the tenant pays. He would pay the same whether his authority was in surplus or in deficit. That makes absolutely no difference whatsover.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is now accepted that there will be a situation where tenants, whether they are paying a fair rent or otherwise, will not receive one penny of subsidy from the ratepayer or from central Government, and part of the money which is coming out of their pockets is going to subsidise the private sector. I hope the Minister will do us the favour of advertising that proposition and disposing of the long held myth that council tenants are a subsidised and cosseted
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0336">Image</span>

<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I make it clear to the Committee that this is an Amendment desired by the Greater London Council. By way of explanation, may I confirm what the hon. Member for Paddington, North (Mr. Latham) said, that Amendment No. 75 was the first shot at attempting to clear up an anomaly under the terms of the Schedule. When it became clear that that was not sufficiently wide, the G.L.C. asked that this Amendment might be substituted. It looked as though that was a sensible argument, so I sought to withdraw Amendment No. 75 and substitute this Amendment.<br><br>
In so far as the hon. Member for Paddington, North strayed beyond the points of order in his submission, he seemed to be questioning the right of the G.L.C. to advance its case for amendment in any way that it thinks fit. It seems to me that it is entirely a matter of G.L.C. judgment how best it seeks to advance any case it has, and it is then up to any members of the Committee who are approached by the G.L.C. or any other outside body to use their judgment in ascertaining whether this is an argument which they wish to present to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 610</span>
the Committee by means of Amendment or in any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's position but the query in the minds of a number of hon. Members is not whether the G.L.C. has the right to make representations on a Bill. That is not the issue.<br><br>
The issue which was raised and which I was happy to support—and about which I still express anxiety—is the fact that a major authority, equivalent to a county council association or the sub-committee of the G.L.C, should not have made its representations known to the members of the Committee until it was too late for action to be taken on quite a number of matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a criticism which hon. Gentlemen opposite may wish to pursue, in a party political sense, with those on the other side of the river but which has nothing to do with this Committee. If the hon. Member for Paddington, North wants to comment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that this matter will not be pursued. I wish to hear arguments in relation to the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. May I do no more than clear up a misunderstanding about what I said? I do not wish to pursue the matter. I merely wish to make it clear that it is now on record that I have questioned the rights of the G.L.C. in a particular matter. I seek your indulgence briefly to defend my position in this matter, since I have been maligned and misrepresented.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me that the hon. Gentleman has made his position perfectly clear to the Chair, to the Committee and to the Greater London Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I comply with your request, Mr. Godman Irvine, and proceed with the arguments in support of the Amendment. I want to make it clear that in doing so I am sustained, at least in part, by the admirable argument in support which the G.L.C. has advanced.<br><br>
Paragraph 21 of the Schedule gives the Secretary of State power to amend the financial terms of Orders for the transfer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0338">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 611</span>
of G.L.C. estates to the London borough councils. It is clear that the Amendment is an attempt to clear up a special situation which arises because of the transfer of estates from the G.L.C. to the London borough councils. Paragraph 21(3) states that payments by one authority to another—for example, borough councils to the G.L.C.—shall not count as expenditure for the purpose of the new subsidy system. But no similar provision is included to the effect that payments received by the G.L.C. are not to count as income for determining the limitation of subsidies and rate fund contributions under paragraph 12.<br><br>
It seems important that an Amendment should be made so that a fair modification of the payments formula, for the transfer of dwellings under the appropriate Order, can be achieved. Broadly speaking, the payments which are to be made are the rents which the G.L.C. would have been charging had it held on to the properties, less rebates which the G.L.C. would have granted and allowances for management and maintenance. But the G.L.C. keeps the loan debt and continues to receive Exchequer subsidies in respect of these properties. The idea behind the payments formula is to put the G.L.C. for 12 years in roughly the same financial position as though the transfer had not taken place.<br><br>
Sub-paragraph (4,<i>a</i>) of Amendment No. 134 is designed to tackle the first part of this anomaly; that is, that part of the Schedule which says that payments by the London boroughs shall not count as expenditure on their part for the purposes of determining subsidy entitlement or rate fund contributions. I accept that. It is also designed to settle the other side of the coin. In other words, as matters stand, there is no provision that any part of this shall not count as income by the G.L.C. for the purpose of eliminating subsidies and rate fund contributions.<br><br>
One accepts that some part may have to be accounted for as income—because the G.L.C. is paying the loan charges on the dwellings, and part of this income should offset the loan charges—but all the borough payments should not necessarily be required to count as income. The new formula that will apply to these transfers is still being settled between the G.L.C. and the boroughs. Thus, the effect of this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 612</span>
part of the Amendment is to give the Secretary of State power to make a direction that so much as he may specify in the Order for payments from one authority to another shall not count as income to the receiving authority's housing revenue account.<br><br>
The second part of sub-paragraph (4) of the Amendment seeks to remedy a potential unfairness to the boroughs which are concerned. Paragraph 1(1) of the Schedule, as it presently stands, requires the London boroughs to credit to the housing revenue account rent income received from the dwellings within the account, and that would include dwellings transferred to them by the G.L.C. Annual payments to G.L.C. under the 1971 Order are debited to the housing revenue account, and, together with the borough's own expenditure on management and maintenance of the dwellings, exactly offset this income. The net effect on the borough's housing revenue account is nil in these circumstances.<br><br>
Under paragraph 21(3), the boroughs' payments do not count for subsidy purposes, but unless we include this part of the Amendment the whole of the rent income from the transferred properties will count for the purpose of limiting the borough's subsidy entitlement in respect of the rest of the dwellings. Sub-paragraph (4,<i>b</i>) of the Amendment, would remedy that disparity.<br><br>
Sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) are designed to cope with the situation whereby, year by year, because of the transfer of boundaries, there may be large increases or decreases in the housing stock of boroughs or of the G.L.C. At the moment, the effect of such substantial transfers between one authority and another in a particular year could be that both the transferor's and transferee's entitlements to transition and rising cost subsidies would be affected. The form in the Bill permits the Secretary of State to include in Orders directions as to how these amounts shall be calculated and how much of them shall count as income and expenditure for those years. They may be determined by him.<br><br>
From the fact that we have an almost exactly similar Amendment to mine on the Notice Paper, Amendment No. 142, it appears that I do not have to convince hon. Gentlemen opposite of the necessity for my Amendment. I hope, therefore,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0339">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 613</span>
that although it sounds immensely complicated—and is immensely complicated in detail—the broad principle of amending the Schedule to make special provision for the anomalous situation which arises because of the transfer of housing stock from the G.L.C. to the boroughs will be acceptable to the Government and that they will accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With all respect to certain colleagues on the Committee, it sometimes seems to me that lawyers' first thoughts are more intelligible than their subsequent thoughts. I hoped that the hon. Member for Paddington, South (Mr. Scott) could have indicated why the very complex form of Amendment No. 134 is to be preferred to the much simpler form of the Amendment which was earlier withdrawn. In both cases the principle is the same, and I do not think that anyone in the Committee would question the merits of the matter which has been put before us.<br><br>
The principle of the Amendment seems to be the same, whatever Amendment is accepted or whatever alternative the Government may subsequently offer.<br><br>
It seems unreasonable that the payment by an authority should be disallowed for expenditure purposes, but that the receiving authority should have that income set against it in determining reckonable expenditure. It seems a simple principle that if one is disallowed payments one ought equally to be disallowed the income, or <i>vice versa.</i> It is rather odd that this logic should have appeared in the Bill in the first instance.<br><br>
I hope I am not straying into realms which we should avoid, Mr. Godman Irvine, but it would have been much more helpful, not merely in considering the principle of either of the Amendments—that which has been withdrawn and that which is now before us—if more advance notice could have been given, and if the memorandum which was offered in support of either of the alternative Amendments had been accessible to each of us some time ago. This memorandum was available several weeks ago, but I only saw it about 10 o'clock last night. There are points on which one might wish usefully to consult the G.L.C. or others, but there was no opportunity. The issue is not how we may exercise judgment in seeking to promote an Amendment, but how one may assist
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 614</span>
the Committee in determining whether or not that Amendment is proper.<br><br>
Similarly reference is made in the memorandum to the powers of the Minister under Clause 4. It would have been extremely helpful to the Committee if these matters had been drawn to our attention at an earlier stage and if, when we were discussing Clause 4, we could have asked the Minister whether its subsection (11) gave the Secretary of State power to act in the way in which this Amendment seems to make possible. Desirable as the principle is which the hon. Member for Paddington, South (Mr. Scott) has put forward, I am not at all clear whether the original form of Amendment No. 75 is not practicable, or whether it is necessary to make an Amendment of this kind, or whether, in fact, the Secretary of State does not have power under Clause 4 to deal with this matter administratively.<br><br>
If I may refresh the Committee's memory, it says
<br><blockquote><p>"… reckonable expenditure … means so much of the expenditure debited to the authority's Housing Revenue Account as the Secretary of State may from time to time determine as being reasonable and appropriate having regard to all the circumstances."</p></blockquote>
If the Secretary of State has regard to the circumstances of the payment by one authority to another, and deems it reasonable that that expenditure and income shall both be regarded as reckonable, there is no need for an Amendment to be made. I should be grateful if the Government spokesman would comment.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
It is interesting as a matter of political significance that parts of the case which the Greater London Council is offering in support of the principle of this Amendment, or of the one before, is that having transferred housing estates to other London boroughs, it has an arrangement whereby the rent income to the G.L.C. is equivalent to rents which would otherwise have been charged by the G.L.C; that the G.L.C. continues to meet the loan debts, and then we have something which it was difficult to get members of the G.L.C. administration to admit publicly, but is clearly set out in the memorandum:
<br><blockquote><p>"The idea behind the formula is to put the G.L.C. in broadly the same financial posi-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0340">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 615</span>
tion for 12 years as if the dwellings had not been transferred so that the nett surplus on the transferred dwellings would contribute towards the heavy deficit on the G.L.C. account resulting from its new building programme."</p></blockquote>
This is the first public acknowledgement I have seen by the Tory-controlled G.L.C. that such a large number of present G.L.C. estates are paying profit rents, and that those tenants in G.L.C. properties, both five and ten years ago, are themselves subsidising the future building programme for London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may like to know that according to the calculations which I had made some time ago, out of the 250,000 G.L.C. tenants about 150,000 or more paid profit rentals. In other words, the vast majority of tenants on G.L.C. estates are not being subsidised in any way whatsoever; they are cross-subsidising elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because a substantial number of those 150,000 live in my constituency. It is an interesting commentary on the general principles of the Bill that the Minister was claiming that there was a subsidy because fair rents, he alleged, are below market rents. He might like to avail himself of the opportunity, if he can overcome his reluctance, of meeting the deputations from some of the tenants organisations and explaining to them not only the difference between market rent and fair rent, as he sees it, but the considerable difference between the proposed fair rent and a profit rent which the majority of G.L.C. tenants are already paying. It is hard, by any stretch of the imagination or argument, to persuade tenants who are already subsidising London building generally, that there is a strong case for requiring them to pay still more and for the surplus to be distributed in a somewhat different way, which was the matter we dealt with in the previous Amendment.<br><br>
A further point, which may be a matter for you, Mr. Godman Irvine, is that on the list of selection it is indicated that the Amendments before us, as I read it, are Government Amendments, but I understood that the Government intended to accept the Amendment in its precise form. The procedural point that arises out of that is whether some precedence is given in the selection of Amend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 616</span>
ments because it is believed that certain Amendments are Amendments that the Government want. If that is the case, the selection of this Amendment in preference to others may have been done on the basis of false information or a false assumption that Amendment No. 134 was a Government-sponsored Amendment rather than an Amendment submitted by back-bench members of the Committee. I should be grateful if the Minister could deal with that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can perhaps help the hon. Gentleman. If he looks down the Notice Paper he will see that we shall be dealing with Schedule 3 out of the order we might otherwise have thought of doing, and these are Amendments to Schedule 3 about which he is talking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Channon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Member for Paddington, North (Mr. Latham) that neither Amendment is satisfactory, and that neither is sponsored by the Government. One is sponsored by my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington, South (Mr. Scott) and one is sponsored by him and his hon. Friends.<br><br>
In order to save time, I should like to tell the Committee that I have been impressed by the arguments adduced both by my hon. Friend and by the hon. Member in general support of the intention behind both these Amendments. For obvious reasons, it is extremely difficult—and both the Amendments are ably drafted—to get Amendments of this complexity right in a complicated Bill, and parliamentary draftsmen are the best people to do this.<br><br>
I should like to say to my hon. Friend, and I hope that this will satisfy the Committee, that I certainly accept the broad intention behind his Amendment. I would also say the same to the hon. Member about the broad intentions of Amendment No. 134, to which he more or less addressed his remarks.<br><br>
I should like to consider sympathetically the points that have been raised and undertake to have discussions with the G.L.C. and the London Boroughs Association about the matter. An Amendment is necessary. The provisions of Clause 4(11) are not wide enough to deal with the question raised by my hon. Friend. The whole paragraph probably needs to be recast and if my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington, South (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V006P0I0341">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 617</span>
Scott) would be kind enough to withdraw his Amendment I undertake that we shall amend the paragraph in due course in order to give effect to the broad intention behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the confirmation by my hon. Friend that an Amendment is necessary and for his expression of general support for such an Amendment. In view of the undertaking he has given, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allaun</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the first change to the Bill that the Government have accepted. Far more serious changes have been proposed, but this is the only concession that has been made and it is made to an hon. Member opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Channon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may correct the hon. Member, I accepted an Amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Willesden, East (Mr. Freeson), although he had not even spoken to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Under-Secretary's view, that, whilst the principle may be sound, the drafting of neither Amendment is acceptable and an appropriate Amendment will be introduced subsequently.<br><br>
Will that subsequent Amendment be introduced on the Floor of the House? Bearing in mind the time factor, is it not perhaps unfortunate that the matter needs to be dealt with in that way? Would the hon. Member for Paddington, South indicate whether he or the Minister has received any direct representations from the G.L.C. on this matter, and if so, would he say when they were received.<br><br>
In view of the remarks of the hon. Member for Paddington, South about the G.L.C. using its judgment in these matters, it would have been most helpful to the Committee and to the Government if those representations had been received from the G.L.C. some time ago. If that were the case, there would have been full opportunity afforded for the discussions which now have to take place to have taken place before this matter came before the Committee. It would then have been possible, had someone not been dilatory, for this matter to have been dealt with at the proper time and in the proper way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Channon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in constant touch with the G.L.C. about a variety of matters.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 618</span>
I received representations from my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington, South (Mr. Scott) in connection with this Amendment and those are the only representations I have received. I understand that there have been no official representations by the G.L.C. That is a matter for the hon. Members to pursue wherever they wish. My hon. Friend has put forward the arguments very cogently, and we wish to consider favourably what he has said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a disgraceful state of affairs for a body like the G.L.C. to discuss matters like this and for the Minister to hear about them from a back-bencher. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not care about the protests of the hon. Member for Epping (Mr. Tebbit). It is nice to hear him say something, if it is only an interjection of that kind. I am trying to be constructive. The largest local authority in the country, and possibly in the world, is apparently unaware of how to communicate with members of a Committee sitting just across the river from it. There has been extraordinary dilatoriness on the part of the G.L.C. If the Minister is in constant touch with the G.L.C, is it not extraordinary that he hears about these matters by virtue of hearsay from his hon. Friend the Member for Paddington, South?<br><br>
The Under-Secretary has told us that he has received no direct communication from the G.L.C; he heard about these matters from his hon. Friend. Can he tell us when he heard from his hon. Friend and why there was not sufficient time to table an adequate Amendment by this morning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Channon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman without notice on which day I heard from my hon. Friend. My hon. Friend will know better than I when he he put his original Amendment on the Amendment Paper. That is presumably when he started to consider the matter. He talked to me about it after a Committee meeting. I returned to find that my hon. Friend had produced a version that he preferred. Either version would have been perfectly acceptable for discussion in Committee and I would have given the same answer to either version—that in principle we accept the intentions behind it but we cannot accept the wording. I do not know why the hon. Gentleman is making such heavy weather of this.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Schedule be the first Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Allason</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As this is the first time that I have spoken in Committee, I should like to declare an interest as an owner and manager of housing property. It has been very difficult for all Members of the Committee to use their judgment on whether they should seek to expedite the passage of the Bill or whether they should enter into Jong-winded discussions upon it. The temptation has been very great on both sides. I am not criticising anyone. I sincerely say that, after considerable experience of opposition in housing matters, it is not necessary to be long-winded in order to make a case.<br><br>
I want to ask about paragraph 20 of the Schedule which requires that district audits of housing revenue accounts only can take place, which means the abolition of the alternative professional audits This seems to be a little strange when Clauses 151 to 163 of the Local Government Bill perpetuate the <i>status quo—</i> that there should be either professional or district audits. There will be considerable difficulty here.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 620</span>
Suppose that a local authority which is a housing authority decides that it would prefer to have a professional audit. That will not be possible in the case of e' its housing revenue account and therefore in there will have to be two audits covering largely the same ground. This surely makes for ineffectual auditing, and it seems rather odd that the Government should have decided to make the Amendment in this Bill and not in the Local Government Bill. I should be grateful for an explanation from the Government.</span></p>
