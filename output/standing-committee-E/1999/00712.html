	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Benton. I seek your guidance about whether our sitting this morning should proceed. As a minor aside, those of us who sought to investigate the budget in advance but who were not Committee members and did not receive the tabbed copies, consulted copies that were supplied by the Vote Office. Yesterday, those copies contained incomplete sets of the budget. It is difficult enough to make head or tail of this astonishing bundle in any event, but an incomplete set makes that even more difficult. I do not stress that—the incompleteness is not critical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As usual, the Treasury has attached a so-called explanatory memorandum, but this year it is not explanatory—in previous years, that document contained the net contribution, but this year it does not do so. We shall debate the document if we are forced to, although that would be improper because other Committee members may not, unlike me, have spent several hours last night working out the net contribution. The Library, astonishingly, does not have what was last year called the yellow book and the previous year the blue book—it contained the relevant statistical series. Unless Committee members had the time to work out the figures on their pocket calculators, they will not know the net contribution. I suspect that the right thing to do is to delay our sitting until the Treasury has provided that information. Mr. Benton, what is the precedent in this context?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's remarks, although it is not clear whether that is a question for me. I suspect that it should be taken up with the usual channels. Papers, irrespective of their tardiness, are before us this morning, and our sitting should progress. If the hon. Gentleman feels strongly enough about this matter, I could make noises in the right quarters, and he could do so with the usual channels. As for this morning's sitting, despite the tardiness of the papers and their volume, it is right and proper to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to discuss the European Community preliminary draft budget, or PDB, for 2001, the Commission's proposals to revise the Berlin
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
financial perspective and for future spending on external relations, and the regulation creating the rapid reaction facility. Committee members have already had the opportunity to read the Government's views of the documents in four explanatory memorandums: on the PDB, the Commission's proposal to revise the financial perspective, the Commission's plans for the future of external aid—or category 4—spending, and the rapid reaction facility. I shall keep my introductory remarks brief. A second explanatory memorandum was issued recently on the full preliminary draft budget, which I hope that Committee members have read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall focus on the Commission's preliminary draft budget for 2001. It covers the second year of the financial perspectives, which were agreed at the 1999 Berlin European Council. The EU budget for the last year, 2000, was the first to be agreed under the new Berlin agreement, and successfully demonstrated that budget discipline is possible in EU spending, and that we can deliver a budget that respects the financial perspective and the new inter-institutional agreement on budgetary discipline. As last year, it is important that the EU budget for 2001 sends a clear message that the EU can set firm spending plans and stick to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
EU budgetary discipline is important, because setting firm limits on expenditure acts to improve value for money from spending, and hence assists in reducing financial mismanagement and fraud. Expenditure in the EU budget represents a significant strain on national budgets for many EU member states, and we must therefore be just as keen to seek efficiency and effectiveness from EU spending as we are in our national budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the United Kingdom is a net contributor to the EU budget, it is in the UK's interests to restrict growth in the budget as much as possible while working to achieve a more efficient use of existing resources. That desire for rigour in the EU budget is shared by a majority of member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the general picture for 2001, the European Commission has proposed an increase of 3.9 per cent. in commitments and an increase of 5 per cent. in payments for the year 2001. The large increase is primarily a result of the reforms to agriculture that were agreed at Berlin. Spending on mandatory payments under the common agricultural policy rises by about 7.5 per cent. in the 2001 PDB, compared with the adopted budget for 2000. That mainly reflects the implementation of Agenda 2000 reforms agreed last year, including an increase of almost 25 per cent. in provision for rural development measures. That reflects progress in the Commission's approval of member states' plans, and the fact that specific rural development programmes are now coming fully on line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding the specific situation with regard to agriculture, the UK Government are concerned that the proposed increases in levels of commitments and payments in the EU budget for 2001 are too high. The Government will look for savings across the budget—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0812">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
in line with our domestic policy priorities—in both commitments and payments in the course of the discussions on the 2001 EU budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of our other priorities for the 2001 budget, the Government are also keen to ensure that sufficient funds are allocated to programmes that will take forward the initiatives on economic reform in Europe agreed by Council at the Lisbon summit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with the EU 2000 budget, a key issue in the negotiation of the 2001 budget is the issue of providing funding for reconstruction in the western Balkans. The Commission has issued a proposal to revise the Berlin financial perspective expenditure limits in order to fund additional aid to Kosovo and the wider western Balkans. The Government strongly believe that it is not necessary to revise Berlin, and that the EU can and should find sufficient resources from within the existing external aid financial perspective limits to provide aid where it is clearly needed. We must, therefore, set priorities for EU aid that allow us to contribute to the recovery of the region. An economically and politically stable Balkan region is in all our interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government note that the Commission has said elsewhere that money in category 4, the external relations section of the EU budget, has been inefficiently spent in the past. Financial assistance to the Balkans from the EU budget must be funded through re-prioritising spending on EU aid programmes within the Berlin ceiling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, EU spending plans for the western Balkans must be set in the context of all sources of finance to the region, including bilateral commitments and funds from the international financial institutions as well as the EU budget contribution. Aid must also take account of the absorption capacity of the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will work closely with other member states to set priorities for EU aid and thus allow sufficient resources for the Balkans, while respecting the Berlin ceilings. As part of that work, the UK Government will also seek to increase the overall proportion of EU aid that goes to the poorest countries over the financial perspective period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the broader future of the EU aid budget, beyond 2001, the Government are especially concerned that these funds must be spent as efficiently as possible, and on the most deserving cases. We therefore welcome the proposals for reform of EU aid spending that have come from Commissioner Chris Patten. We look forward to seeing more detail on the proposed reforms, and to working with the Commission to ensure that the EU aid budget—including the European development fund, which represents 10 per cent. of all world aid—is spent wisely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the proposal for a regulation on the rapid reaction facility, the Government support the principle of easier and more effective deployment of Community funds in questions of emergency or crisis. We therefore support the inclusion of the new budget line in the EU budget for 2001. The new line will, of course, need to be accommodated within the Berlin ceiling for category 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Finally, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we continue to seek improved efficiency and effectiveness from all EU expenditure. To that end, we remain determined to tackle fraud at every level in the European Community. The Government therefore welcome the doubling of funding in the EU budget for budget lines that reinforce anti-fraud activities in member states in parts of the EU budget where administration is primarily undertaken by member states. The Government also welcome the funding proposed by the Commission for other anti-fraud activities—although on the proposed increase in staff for OLAF, the European anti-fraud office, the Government believe that what is important is the quality, not necessarily the number, of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the resolutions to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all hon. Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the United Kingdom's net contribution implied by the 2001 PDB, and what was the UK's net contribution implied by the 2000 draft supplementary and amending budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say first that in relation to the point that the hon. Gentleman made earlier, we have shown the gross sum before abatement and the gross sum after abatement, which is the relevant figure for the PDB, and which the hon. Gentleman queried. There is nothing unusual about the figures that we have given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about abatement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked about the net contribution, which the Minister is concealing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I am concealing nothing. I take offence at that remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK's gross contribution before abatement is set to rise by some 2 billion euro. After abatement, the UK's gross contribution is set to rise by only 123 million euro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Net.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The net is calculated on the basis of taking one figure from the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but this is not my idea of what the questions formula should be about. The hon. Member who is responding should be able to give a reply. If there is an opportunity for hon. Members to return to answers with which they are dissatisfied, I shall try to give everyone a chance to get in. However, I will not tolerate interruptions during replies; it is not fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Benton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) is looking for a figure for the current year, we cannot forecast on net contribution receipts, only on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0813">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
trend. It is not possible to predict the net contribution for 2001 at this stage, because it involves complex calculations, many of which will have to be based on figures that are not yet available. Nothing has changed in respect of the difficulty of providing the figure that I understand the hon. Gentleman to be seeking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the reduction in the gross contribution after abatement demonstrate the importance of the Government's retaining the abatement? Is not it also the case that where there is a pre-abatement increase, the vast majority of that increase reflects the strength of the United Kingdom's economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed true that a substantial chunk of the increase reflects the strength of the United Kingdom's economy. Our contributions are based on our gross national product and, as that is growing with the economy, our contributions increase as a share of the total. That is good news. It shows how well the Government's economic policies are working and the importance of our argument for similar changes in the economies of other member states to reflect the new economies and the need to stimulate work, jobs and growth. All are reflected in our increased contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having interjected from a sedentary position. I was unable to contain myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain how she performed the miracle of calculating the abatement, which is 66 per cent. of the net contribution, having allowed for the gross contribution to be rebased on a VAT base, if she did not know what the net contribution was? How did she calculate 66 per cent. of an unknown figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The abatement is calculated a year in arrears and I understand that it has always been done in that way. It is subsequently adjusted a number of times to reflect, for example, changes in the calculation of GNP figures for member states. We do not have a single fixed figure, but I should have said in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell) that we have agreed to pay not a euro more and not a euro less. It is to the credit of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that we sustained our position on the abatement in relation to our colleagues in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give a round figure for the amount of taxpayers' money that goes to Kosovo?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The funding lines for Kosovo come under the category 4 external policies heading and I can give my hon. Friend an indication of the projected expenditure in Kosovo. The Commission has proposed a revision of the category 4 ceiling, which we do not support, by some 280 million euro, with 5.5 billion euro being spent in the western Balkans. It is not clear that there is a demonstrable need for or capacity to absorb that money, and we believe that the necessary funding for Kosovo and the western Balkans
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
can be achieved below the category 4 ceiling by reducing expenditure in areas where the money is not well used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's opening statement and especially the emphasis on resisting the increases in spending proposed by the Commission above the Berlin financial perspective ceilings. Do other member states feel as strongly as Britain about the matter? What are the chances of a successful renegotiation of the Commission's position in returning to the Berlin financial perspectives—or will there simply be huffing and puffing by other member states, with eventual acquiescence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I answer my hon. Friend's question, I would like to add one further thing to what I said on Kosovo to my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). The bilateral UK commitment in Kosovo since March 1999 stands at 119 million euro.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North, I would say that I have attended several Budget Council meetings over the past year. Indeed, there is a Budget Council meeting on Thursday. From the discussions that have taken place there and at ECOFIN, I know that there is wide support among member states for maintaining financial discipline and maintaining the agreement made in Berlin. Supporting the western Balkans is an important policy objective, and member states agree that we can do so while maintaining the necessary discipline on category 4, from which we will find the money. A large number of member states hold views on the matter that are similar to those of the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wycombe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister suggested that the growth in the United Kingdom's contribution reflected the growth in the UK economy. However, is it not the case that most—if not all—of the continental economies are growing at a faster rate than the British economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the figures for the economies of all the other member states. In general, the growth rate of our economy is outstripping those of many other member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is shaking his head, but I can assure him that that is correct. Our GNP is growing more rapidly, as a proportion of EU GNP, so our contributions, which are based on it, are greater.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By how much have tobacco guarantee payments risen and at what level do they now stand? What did she say about them last year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) was Economic Secretary then, and the hon. Gentleman was present when she spoke. I am sad to learn that he has forgotten about it.

The hon. Gentleman has raised the issue of tobacco payments, as he did last year. The regime that was introduced in 1970 was designed to support production in disadvantaged farming areas, and there is still strong pressure in the European Union for its retention. The Court of Auditors has been highly critical of the regime, notably in a report brought out in 1987, and we would like to see changes made. However, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Austria, Italy and Greece are all inclined to support the production of tobacco in the EU, and it will not be easy to change the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some reform of the regime was agreed in 1992, as part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, and in 1998. It was aimed at making the regime more market-orientated, and controlling and reducing production. We believe that the reforms did not go far enough. The 1998 reform was less radical than we would have liked, but it was a step in the right direction. It encourages tobacco growers to be more market-orientated and provides a mechanism for reducing aid to tobacco production over time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regime, as amended in 1998, required the Commission to submit a report on its functioning before 1 April 2002. We intend to use that report as the basis for pressing our long-term objective of progressive disengagement from the regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an increase in the cost of the tobacco regime. I cannot remember which year's figures the hon. Member for West Dorset asked me for. The cost was 911 million euro in 1999 and will be 975 million euro in 2000. The proposed cost for 2001 is 1.002 billion euro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall that on one of the last occasions when tobacco subsidies were voted on in the European Parliament, the vast majority of Conservative MEPs voted against reducing them? Does she not think that we need some consistency on these issues, across the political parties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point; he is entirely right. It would also be extremely helpful if we could rely on the Opposition to ensure that their MEPs pursue a policy objective in line with the UK Government's position, which aims to reduce tobacco production and so improve the health of many nations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But does not Her Majesty's Government's position on this stink? How can the Government profess to pursue an ethical foreign policy while using British taxpayers' money to promote the cultivation of a crop that is clearly damaging to health? Should not the Government cut off their contribution to that item and challenge the EU to take us to the European Court of Justice? Would not that be the appropriate action to take, or is the Minister terrified of being outvoted on an issue such as this, which is decided by qualified majority voting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Terrified I very seldom am. We have not been successful in securing a majority in support of the UK's position on this matter. I am not aware of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
what the previous Government did about tobacco, but they certainly did not pursue the course of action advocated by the hon. Gentleman. We are doing all that we can to end this form of subsidy. We do not believe that it is right. However, only so much can be achieved when we have to take other countries with us and they are very resistant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I catch your eye later, Mr. Benton, I will explain exactly the direction from which I am coming. Briefly, I am deeply critical—having been in Kosovo last week, staying with my former national service regiment—of what is happening to British Government funds. My hon. Friend uses the word "mis-spent". I can only say that I saw areas—the strongest Kosovo Liberation Army areas—where there was considerable prosperity. People were building their houses with the most expensive German bricks. Is the Treasury casting a beady eye on precisely what happens to the funds that go to Kosovo? To what extent do people who have a great deal of money already from the Albanian diaspora spend the money, to put it bluntly, on drugs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should talk to my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Ms Jones) about the trafficking in women and corruption as a whole, because there is a great suspicion that British taxpayers' money is, to use her word—and it is the politest word—mis-spent in Kosovo. Is she satisfied with the monitoring of what actually happens to the money that comes from this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The broad answer is no, we are not satisfied. We are endeavouring to ensure that the monitoring is more tightly controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw my hon. Friend's attention to a useful article in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> of 23 June, which he may have read, by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development. She writes, among other things, that
	<br><q><p>it is right for the EU to help stabilise the Balkans.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I am sure that my hon. Friend and I would agree about that. However, my right hon. Friend goes on to say that stabilising the region</p></q>
	<br><q><p>means assessing needs and providing technical assistance that helps reform and does not crowd out private-sector flows.</p></q>
She also says that
	<br><q><p>the EU also needs to improve vastly the quality of its programmes as well as the speed of implementation. Otherwise we will just have bad programmes delivered quickly.</p></q>
That is a general point about how EU aid is spent, and it applies as much to Kosovo as to many other programmes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister tell us why olive oil guarantee payments are scheduled to increase by 100 million euro?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a slippery question. Perhaps I could offer to write to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, in one of her explanatory memorandums, points out that our contributions to the European budget are significantly affected by the exchange rate of the pound relative to the euro. At some point, although obviously not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0815">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
today, I would like to know the extent of that in real money terms. We cannot answer that question until we know our net contribution to the budget. Does she agree that such issues reinforce concerns about the strength of the pound relative to the euro and that it also reinforces the case—I believe that there is a case—for intervention in the foreign exchange markets to bring down the value of the pound?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's continuing interest in the subject of interventions in the exchange rate. The Government's position is that it is unwise to intervene in the exchange rate, and I had a similar debate with him in another Committee a few weeks ago. Intervention in the exchange rate was a feature of the previous Government's economic policies. We believe that our focus on the inflation target is the right way to drive forward our economic policy. Trying to affect the exchange rate as part of economic policy would be a disaster and would lead to boom and bust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned the effects of exchange rates on the figures, which is a phenomenally complex matter. Basically, changes affect figures from year to year, but the overall effect is not great over a period of time. There is a set of complex reasons for that, and I will provide an explanatory memorandum before the end of this month to outline how the changes will take effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What estimate has the Minister made of the opportunity cost to British citizens of the massive and growing contributions from the UK to the European Union? Is this an issue in Treasury discussions or is it felt in Treasury circles that we have no control over our contributions, so it does not matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it not true that it would be better for my constituents—whose local authority is in crisis because it cannot balance its books, and who tomorrow will face the official announcement of the intended closure of Harefield, the premier cardiothoracic hospital in the country—to have their money allocated to such domestic programmes than to the waste and mismanagement of an ever burgeoning EU budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped that I had explained to the hon. Gentleman in my opening remarks that we believe strongly in budgetary discipline. It is a matter for all member states to ensure, through the budgetary process, that the budget of the EU is no larger than it usefully need be and that the money provided is well spent and monitored in the ways that we have been discussing. The vast majority of the budget is set within a medium-term framework, which does not allow for radical reordering of priorities from one year to the next. However, we will, with other Council members, seek to achieve the cuts in the Commission's proposals that I mentioned, particularly where they exceed the financial perspective ceilings. We are looking for better prioritisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
The Community budget has been consistently underspent over the past few years, and we seek to ensure that the level of payments into the budget reflects the likely outturn and is not systematically higher. I agree that that is important, because member states' resources should not be called up in advance of real need. We continue to question and to tighten control of the overall budget and how it is spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to make economic help meaningful to the Balkans, one crucial issue is the unblocking of the Danube. Last September, my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) and I sat in the office of the Belgrade technocrat who was in charge of the Yugoslav policy for the rebuilding of the bridges at Novi Sad. He made it clear that nothing would be done until the deutschmarks, dollars and sterling were on the table, not only for the removal of the bridges, but for their reconstruction. Other countries in the Balkans are much more hurt by the blockage than Serbia, as are Austria and Germany.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The night before last, several hon. Members went to the Bulgarian embassy to meet the mayor of Sofia. To give us a taste of the problem, he told us that he had bought 17 tramcars from the Czech Republic, which would normally have come down the Danube. In the present circumstances, they had to come by rail. They did not fit in the tunnels. At every tunnel, they had to be moved off the rails and then put back on again. The net result was that, for each tramcar, the transport cost twice as much as the car itself. That is typical. Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary are in great difficulty. If we are talking about the Balkans, there must be a policy on the unblocking of the Danube.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfair to ask the Economic Secretary to the Treasury to come up with an answer, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hesitate to intervene on the hon. Gentleman, but I must ask him to come to the point of the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is: what is the financial policy towards the unblocking of the Danube?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend's question is properly one for the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for International Development rather than for a Treasury Minister. However, our immediate focus is on ensuring that any assistance produces real long-term social and economic benefits. Important structural provision in Kosovo, and more widely in the western Balkans, is an essential part of that. I accept that matters relating to economic activity are important in that context, but the detail would best be sought from one of my colleagues in other Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to draw the Minister's attention to volume 7, relating to the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. What is the total planned expenditure for 2001 in the preliminary draft budget under that heading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have that figure in front of me at the moment. I shall be happy to answer the hon. Gentleman's question in writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is always right to seek budgetary discipline, but does my hon. Friend agree that we should also have an objective context in these discussions? With reference to the previous question, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) made a comparison between EU spending and our contribution to the national health service. Out net contribution last year—about £2.5 billion—was only half the amount that the Government delivered in additional resources to the national health service this year. Is it not, therefore, wrong to give the impression that this country would gain a massive financial dividend by leaving the European Union? That seemed to be the hon. Gentleman's implication, but it would simply not be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for those remarks. The extra money that we are providing for the national health service is way in excess of any amount provided by the previous Government, and marks an all-time high in extra expenditure for health services in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it was "good news" that our own resources contribution—our automatic contribution—is increasing as a proportion of gross national product. That is because our economy—outside the euro zone, which constitutes a majority of member states of the European Union—is growing faster than the economies of those states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that good news because it demonstrates that it is better to manage our own economy with our own currency? Alternatively, is it good news because my constituents are being penalised by the transfer to the European Union of the additional wealth that they have created through their own hard work, in addition to the transfer of their resources to Her Majesty's Exchequer through an ever-increasing burden of taxation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is good news because the growth in the UK economy has led to the creation of more than 900,000 extra jobs over the past few years, and to a drop in long-term and youth unemployment of about 65 to 70 per cent., depending on the area of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, I do not have the unemployment figures for the hon. Gentleman's constituency, but I suspect that it will have experienced a similar drop in unemployment and increase in job creation, because almost all constituencies have benefited equally from the great improvements in the performance of the economy. We have not only created more work—more people are in work than ever before—but increased public expenditure and put more money into public services at the same time as reducing the national debt. All those things are massively to the advantage of the hon. Gentleman's constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to draw my hon. Friend the Minister's attention to the appropriations for commitments in the Commission's proposals. The tables suggest that, as a proportion of the total budget over the next six years, agriculture spending will rise
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
and structural operations spending will fall. Those figures are significant. The trend over many years has been for agriculture spending to fall proportionally and now it is set to increase. Agriculture spending is disadvantageous to Britain, in net budget terms, whereas structural spending is beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government concerned about that, and are they continuing to press for an overall reduction in agriculture spending as a proportion of the budget and an increase in other forms of spending that will promote economic development and equality across the EU?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, the Agenda 2000 reforms are expected to result in higher expenditure in this period, but they will be followed by reductions later in the financial perspective to bring average spending down to 40.5 billion euro in the annual budget. Despite the budget increases in agriculture, the overall benefit to the UK economy will be about 200 million euro in 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend that we shall keep a close eye on developments to ensure that CAP spending is kept within tight limits and continues to respect the ceilings that were agreed in Berlin. The Government's long-term policy is to secure a much more competitive and sustainable industry with a much stronger market orientation. That was our philosophy in pressing for the radical reform of the common agricultural policy through the Agenda 2000 negotiations. There are some encouraging aspects to expenditure on agriculture, such as increased support for organic farming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Benton, if I preface this question with a brief explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the point in the Committee unless the Minister can answer questions, and I have tried to help her to do so by giving her one of the relevant documents. Unfortunately, I cannot give her the second relevant document, because it is not in the pile. To add to the mess, title 7 is placed in the wrong order. My documents were also in the wrong order, but I have got them straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw two items to the Minister's attention. Both are in title 10, both are linked to other expenditure, and both concern the Economic and Social Committee. One shows a figure of 79 million euro in appropriations for 2001, the other shows zero. I do not understand how we are to proceed unless the Minister can explain what on earth is going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes on the spur of the moment to pick two randomly selected figures out of a thick wodge of documents, and expects me to provide an explanation, I may not be able to help him. However, I do not believe that that is necessarily the function of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then what is its function?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members sitting on Committees such as this normally accept that Ministers will write to them about detailed points on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
which they have alighted. If the hon. Gentleman will explain his exact interest in the matter, I shall be happy to write to him about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What Treasury official—I am not, of course, asking for names, but grades—has read the report of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, which was published on 23 May? It is a thorough document on which colleagues and officials worked very hard. I am not a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, by the way. Can the Minister assure me that the document has been properly read by those at the Treasury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend will appreciate, I am not privy to the reading programmes of Treasury officials, but we have extensive links with the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development, and I am sure that some officials will have looked at the worthwhile report to which he referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they have looked at it, I hope that they paid special attention to paragraph 224. My colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee concluded:
	<br><q><p>We believe that large scale unemployment is one of the most major problems which Kosovo faces, and that urgent consideration should be given to the development of successful employment schemes.</p></q>
That clearly has financial implications. Inquiries should be made to ensure that the Treasury has read and digested the report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly make sure that that is so. I assure my hon. Friend that the Treasury is renowned—sometimes infamously so—for its desire to keep track of what is going on across Government. I am sure that that will lead to the result that he seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her opening remarks, the Economic Secretary said that the regulation that will be imposed on member states under category 4—EU external programmes—will lead to the creation of a rapid reaction facility. What burden will that place on the British taxpayer in the current financial year? Is a regulation that cannot be amended and is incorporated directly into British law the appropriate mechanism for a matter that is potentially so controversial? Should not most of the resources for the rapid reaction function come from NATO and not be new money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood the nature of the rapid reaction facility—it is a budgetary mechanism and does not involve personnel. We support it because there should be a budgetary mechanism to ensure that the EU can respond to emergencies and crises. We also insist that it should come within the existing budgetary disciplines and the financial ceiling that applies to category 4 expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise again for asking the Economic Secretary for a rapid reaction. She thinks that 79 million euro is a mere detail about which we need not worry. I draw her attention to the total agricultural spend of 44 billion euro, which I am sure she agrees is not a detail. She said that the figure had risen by 7.6 per cent.—that percentage appears in the documents, although I cannot find it easily. She attributed that to Agenda 2000, but how on earth can she do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could give a long account of this matter. The cap in Agenda 2000 was agreed in Berlin in March 1999. That went a long way towards meeting the UK's objectives, although the total cost exceeded the capped spending limit that was agreed by heads of state at Petersberg. The UK strongly advocated the introduction of degressivity—that word has been applied in this context, although I am not sure whether it existed previously—which involves reducing aid gradually in an effort to achieve budgetary constraints, and ensuring that reforms have adequately prepared the ground for the forthcoming World Trade Organisation round. However, that was not adopted. To reduce expenditure, the European Council made other amendments, including the proposal that from 2000 cereal support prices will fall by 15 per cent., the basic price for beef will fall by 20 per cent. and the dairy support prices will fall by 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key element of the reform is the creation of an integrated rural development policy, including agri-environmental measures. The ceiling agreed in Berlin means that common agricultural policy spending will, for the first time, be on a downward trend for several years, after an initial rise due to the compensation arrangements. It will fall year on year in real terms from 2002. An integrated European Union rural development policy was created to shift the emphasis from production support to environmental and rural economy measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the rise in expenditure from the previous financial perspective, the apparent increase from 40.5 billion euro in 1999 to 41.6 billion euro in 2006 is illusory. The latter figure includes nearly 2 billion euro specifically for rural development which was previously spent under the structural funds and has simply been transferred to the common agricultural policy budget heading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have any figures on the aid that has been given to Macedonia?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can answer that question at the moment, but I may be able to do so later this morning. If not, I shall write to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the fact that I misunderstood the phrase "rapid reaction facility", the European security and defence identity is already being implemented and staff, including the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Solana, and various military officers who now advise him, have been in post for

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never speculate on what might be, because that is dangerous for any politician. The hon. Gentleman's questions are probably best addressed to my hon. Friends in the Ministry of Defence, but I shall write to him with any figures that we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw my hon. Friend's attention to her memorandum of 9 June, in which she referred to aid to Cyprus and Malta. Will she ensure that that aid is protected in any attempt to reduce the Commission's spending? Those economies are small, and Cyprus is in a vulnerable part of the world. Does she agree that protection of that spending, which is not large when compared with the bloated agriculture budget, could make a significant contribution to ending the painful division of Cyprus and bringing a united and democratic Cyprus within the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I can assure my hon. Friend that we have no intention of cutting support to Cyprus and Malta. I entirely understand his argument for continuing that aid. It is making a useful contribution to those countries, which may indeed join the European Union at some stage.

It is worth mentioning that the Commission is interested in reallocating the lines from category 4 to category 7. We support the expenditure, but believe that it should be maintained in category 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister will attend to the market support expenditure line. In the light of her remark that market support in agriculture was on a downward path, can she explain how, between Budget 2000 and this preliminary draft budget, it has risen by 7.4 per cent., from 36 billion-odd euro—almost 37 billion euro—to 39 billion-odd euro, which is almost 40 billion euro?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had explained that the apparent increase was, in fact, illusory, but it would seem that the hon. Gentleman has not taken my point. It is unfortunate that, when I answer his questions, he does not take sufficient account of the explanations that he receives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree that the justification for the increases is limited. As I said, we are seeking to reduce our expenditure under many of the headings, and we believe that the money should be better deployed. Either it should not be spent by the EU, or it should be spent better within the EU; the current level of expenditure is wrong. No Ministers from the previous Government are present this morning, but I am sure that those of the hon. Gentleman's colleagues who were Ministers will be aware of the difficulty of persuading other member states of the wisdom of our case. We will fight on for the UK in these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><q><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents Nos. COM (2000) 300, the Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB) of the European Communities for 2001 (Volumes 0, 1,4, 5, 6, 7 and 8), and the Commission's Overview of the PDB (Provisional Volume 0); 8795/00, Commission Communication concerning revision of the financial perspective (200 1-2006); financing of the programme of assistance for the Western Balkans; and re-classification of aid to Cyprus and Malta: proposal for revision of the financial perspective; COM (2000) 268, Commission Communication on 2000-2006 financial programming of heading four of the Community Budget; and supports the Government's efforts to maintain budget discipline in the Community.—[	<i>Miss Melanie Johnson.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not often get cross in Parliament; it does not assist one's cause. However, I am a little cross today. We might just as well abandon this sitting of the Committee. I am not talking about the serious questions that were asked about Kosovo: they were useful, and the Economic Secretary appeared to have a vague understanding, at least, of what she was talking about. Perhaps, that justifies our presence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering what is, by any standards, enormous expenditure, and yet the Economic Secretary has not the slightest idea—I shall demonstrate this in a moment—about how it breaks down or about how or why it has increased, and is simply burbling to us. It is a farce. It is also farcical that members of the Committee have not been helped to understand the figures, which are incomprehensible, not least because there are gross errors in the reproduction. I do not envy the poor old officials who have put the papers together, nor do I blame them: how could anyone be expected to photocopy these things properly? None the less, the papers are all in the wrong order and there are bits and pieces here and there—the thing is a complete mess. The Economic Secretary is a mess. The budget is a mess. The production is a mess. The Committee is a mess. That is not a satisfactory state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be better if Ministers gave up the pretence that they had the slightest control over our contribution to the budget and simply said to the Commission, "Get on with it. You may understand what is in this pile of papers"—I doubt whether it does—"but we do not have the slightest hope of doing so." They could give up the pretence of consulting Parliament, stick with the limit on total own resources—Ministers might just understand that, and I think that the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary do—and let it go. That, at least, would be honest, and we could then institute a control mechanism in the EU involving people who do know what they are talking about—people who live this stuff and understand it. The Court of Auditors is a modest step in that direction. Then, maybe, we would have a rational system. It would not be ideal; indeed, it would be suboptimal, and my hon. Friends and I would have grave doubts about it. At least, however, it would be honest, whereas we now have a piece of straight spin. There is the appearance that we have a Committee, a Minister and a budget, but in fact no information has been conveyed to the Committee, and the Ministers do not have any information either.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
Let me illustrate my objections, using the Economic Secretary's own replies. I shall deal first with agriculture. I understand that the Economic Secretary is in a difficult position—like me, she has not been a Member of Parliament for long, and she probably has no rural constituents and knows little about agriculture. Moreover, I appreciate that she is not responsible for agricultural matters—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of information, Mr. Benton. I point out to the hon. Gentleman that I was brought up in a rural area, and that I spent most of my childhood on a farm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that, it is rather reprehensible that the Economic Secretary has not the slightest idea what degressivity is. It is another word for modulation, which involves not reducing the budget progressively but so adjusting matters that there is a differential between the support mechanisms for smaller and larger farms. This is a highly controversial issue for those of us who are concerned about it. The brief that the Economic Secretary read out was factually wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary alerted me to what she described as merely an apparent difference between two figures, but the figures that she discussed were different from those to which I drew her attention. She obviously has not looked at the relevant page on which the appropriations commitments are listed—it makes the agricultural line perfectly clear. Eventually, someone passed her a note that contained the truth, namely, that there is, as she put it, "limited justification" for a 7.4 per cent. rise in support measures. By golly, there should be limited justification for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms that the Economic Secretary used in her initial explanation of the justification, and those in the memorandum, are, I regret to say, straightforwardly fallacious. She said that Agenda 2000 was involved. Some of us have spent hours examining Agenda 2000, and by no stretch of the imagination could it be said to contain anything that could justify an increase in support mechanisms. It involves the admirable aim of transferring away from support mechanisms and towards other measures. The other measures line is a separate line—it is called the accompanying measures line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing not a detail—we shall return to the details in a moment—but expenditure of 45 billion euro, give or take a bit. The Economic Secretary does not have the foggiest clue what is going on. I do not wholly blame her—it might be beyond the ability of the Treasury and its Ministers to get a grip on the figures, and it might be best to leave the matter to the experts in Brussels. However, Committees in Westminster should be aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the reason for my crossness in this context is that last night I spent several hours trying to make sense of the situation, but it is impossible to do so. The same piece of paper contained the figures zero and 79 million euro. I challenge any Committee member,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
of any party, to say that they understand what is going on. If I were the Economic Secretary, I should have gone through the papers, asked officials about the situation and tried to write on a single piece of paper roughly what is going on. However, I might have had a heart attack by now if I had tried to do so. If the Economic Secretary had done so, she would know that the papers were in a hopeless muddle, but she could have asked her officials to do something about that, which would have allowed us to have a sensible discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That consideration is more powerful than the matter that I am about to discuss, although that is pretty mind-numbing. Unlike the Economic Secretary, I am terrified of all sorts of things, including the matter that I am about to discuss. I have pointed to a democratic deficit about which we all know and could, in a sense, live with. However, the fact that it poses as democracy is the worst of it. We really cannot continue in that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a critical question for the UK. I admit at the outset that I may be completely mistaken. Neither I nor, I suspect, the Economic Secretary, if she is being honest—I am sure that she is—knows whether I am mistaken. We have not been told anything about net contribution. I got out a pocket calculator and tried, as best I could, to work it out. I did so in the absence of the usual publication—the yellow book and the blue book were available for similar debates in previous years, but that publication was not ready this year. The Economic Secretary gave a fuzzy explanation about why net contributions were omitted. We do not know—I challenge any Committee member to contradict me—what the net contribution is. I suspect that the Economic Secretary genuinely does not have the foggiest clue. If I worked out the net contributions wrongly, it is up to her to explain why. If I have not got it quite wrong, the wider world will be, to put it mildly, interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my amateur way I shall explain, as carefully and dispassionately as I can, the basis on which abatement is calculated. I may have referred to that in an earlier question at too great a speed. The situation is clearly set out in the explanatory memorandum, which, in this regard, coheres with other details that I have gathered over the years. There may be technical complexities in the calculation of the UK's abatement that I do not understand. However, looking back a year—we shall return to the question of which year we are talking about, which is one of many recurrent nightmares in dealing with these budgets—I think that the UK's gross contribution was recalculated to represent the gross contribution that would have applied if only VAT contributions and not GNP contributions had been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most years in the past, that has not made a great deal of difference, because the VAT-based figures and the GNP-based figures were similar. Hon. Members may have noticed, if they have attended carefully to the figures, that in this budget year the two have diverged for various reasons, to which I shall return. The VAT-based and GNP-based elements of the gross contribution are widely different from one another. In
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0820">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
order to calculate the abatement, one strips away the GNP-based element of the gross contributions, grosses up—so to speak—the VAT-based element, subtracts the receipts received by the UK, and takes 66 per cent. of the difference. That is the abatement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads to the principle that the Treasury applies to our domestic Departments, which is that it is no use their saying that their spending is funded by the EU, because a large part of the amount that they receive from the EU is paid for by the UK taxpayer. Our receipts go up, our abatement consequently goes down, and we are therefore paying 66 per cent. of the amount that we think we are getting from the EU in increased net contributions. I understand that logic. It has always been clear in past years roughly what the net contribution was going to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened this year? The UK abatement is calculated in the Treasury's memorandum as being set to rise by 56 per cent.—that is 1.9 billion euro, or about £1 billion. That is a 50 per cent. rise in sterling, and a 56 per cent. rise in euros. The Minister made great play, as did the memorandum, about how wonderful that was. We agree. It is splendid that the Government have defended the abatement. She also said that, after the abatement, the gross contribution was not so terrifying. Splendid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How has the abatement risen? Why has it done so? I gave that rather long explanation of how I think the abatement is calculated in order to point out that the abatement has risen because the net contribution has risen. The one cannot rise without the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I genuinely do not know whether the net contribution widened by about 50 per cent. last year, or whether it will widen by 50 per cent. on this year's budget. I do not know because I cannot find out. We have not been told, and that is quite astonishing. Here we are in a Committee in Parliament—that is not a total joke: we are still a Parliament, just—and we are meant to be debating a budget that will have a direct impact on our taxpayers. The Treasury has provided us with information that makes it perfectly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making an extremely important point about the abatement. However, is it not the case that we receive the abatement a year in arrears? The benefit to us is, therefore, much delayed, which produces a further opportunity cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Something happens a year in arrears. I confess that I do not know quite what that is—and neither does the Economic Secretary. However, we shall find out later just what happens. I think that the abatement does not so much arrive a year in arrears as get calculated on the basis of the previous year's net contribution. I may be wrong about that. That is what the Economic Secretary said in her earlier remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way or another, there is a lag in the process. However, one cannot avoid the fact that in some year, the net contribution—on a VAT basis—rose by about 50 per cent. in sterling terms, or about 56 per cent. in euro terms. While the VAT and GNP elements were roughly similar, rebasing to a VAT element would not have had much effect on our net contribution.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
However, once the GNP element balloons, if the net contribution for the purposes of calculating the abatement is based on the VAT element being grossed up, one will be doubly hit—one's GNP contribution, which is a large part of one's actual gross contribution, will have risen, one's abatement will not have risen to reflect it, and one's net contribution will therefore rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we are dealing with two sets of rises. First, there may have been a rise last year in the net contribution based on VAT or GDP—more or less indifferently, because the figures were similar—of about 50 to 56 per cent., depending on whether one uses sterling or euros. The Government have never told us whether that is the case—if so, it is astonishing. Secondly, there may have been a further increase in the net contribution this year due to the fact that the abatement reflects the VAT base, whereas the GNP-based contribution shot up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps both those effects will be combined in this year's figures, in which case we will see a far larger rise in the net contribution this year. I do not know—because the Minister does not know, or, if she does know, she is not telling us. I asked her a straight question—what is the net contribution? She gave us some waffle—marvellous "Yes, Minister"-ish stuff about its being so complicated that she could not tell us. The document is intended to be read by Members of Parliament, who are, I admit, not geniuses. We are applying ordinary intellects to the matter. Given that, the document should have been written for people with ordinary intellects, and the figures should mean something. To such a person, a variation of 56 per cent. in the abatement suggests a variation of 56 per cent. in the net contribution. The rest of the logic that I have described emerges not least from the memorandum itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is astonishing that our net contribution should have risen by that amount, and that the public have not been told about it. We can all speculate about the reasons for that. What is most astonishing, however, is that Parliament is not being told about it through today's Committee. What is the point of having a debate about the EU budget if the single most important feature for the UK—our net contribution—is not discussed? On that principle, we could have debates about defence without discussing the Army. It is a purposeless exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having expostulated with perhaps less calmness of temperament than I should have displayed, I shall attempt a rational explanation of what has happened. If the Minister understood what is going on in agriculture, she would have a clue about what is happening to our contribution. We are not dealing with two disparate sets of incomprehensibilia; we are dealing with two connected sets of comprehensibilia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something has gone hopelessly wrong in the control of the support payments on agriculture. I do not know—nor, of course, does the Minister—exactly what went wrong in the negotiating process. Olive oil has gone up, tobacco has gone up, cereals have gone up—all kinds of items have gone up, and none of the money seems to be coming our way. That is sometimes with good reason—we do not grow tobacco or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0821">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
produce olive oil, so we do not get those receipts: they are going southwards. I do not begrudge southern Europe some support—it needs it. It will need a lot more under the euro, because Greece will probably go belly-up, as Ireland is in the process of doing. That aside, southern Europe is getting a pile of money under the support mechanisms; we are not. I understand that. I am not pleading for olive oil support for the farmers of West Dorset, nor for those represented by any other Member of Parliament, because they do not grow olives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distortion of the budget that is implied by whatever has gone wrong with the support mechanisms is taking money from us and giving it to them. That may or may not be a good thing. I do not think that it is a good thing, nor do farmers and taxpayers in my constituency—but it might be a good thing and, if so, it should be explained and defended. If the Minister is the Minister who sits on the wretched Councils that deal with this budget, she should know about the dynamics of what is going on and be able to defend it, however difficult that may be. First, she got the whole matter wrong because she was referring to the wrong set of figures, and then she said that there was "limited justification" for it. In fact, the Treasury should have thrown up its hands in collective horror some time ago and said, "There is a real problem developing here. We are going to have real difficulties with our net contributions because a huge amount of money is being hoovered into southern European agriculture." Not to have done that is quite astonishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the problem is structural or transitional. If Agenda 2000 works, I suppose that it may be transitional because it will reduce the support budget. That is the purpose of Agenda 2000. However, depressingly, it is likely to do the reverse and some hon. Members on both sides of the Committee agree with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am loth to intrude in my hon. Friend's interesting speculation, but the European Union is supposedly gearing up for expansion. If our friends in central and eastern Europe, who have been left out in the cold for so long, are to join the community of sovereign states, they will require at least some agriculture support from the European Union, so is not the agriculture budget bound to rise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that my hon. Friend is right. Ministers have been assuring us in Committee and in other places for two or three years that they were attending to that very problem with eagle-eyed acuity and making headway. I do not know whether they are making headway, but they are certainly not attending with eagle-eyed acuity. They cannot even control it when it is in the hands of existing member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that a serious problem is looming. My hon. Friends the Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Wycombe (Sir R. Whitney) know from personal experience that part of the reason for Agenda 2000, which is a fine document in principle, is to prepare for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
eventual enlargement, which would otherwise lead to a colossal and unsustainable rise in the agriculture budget. The Committee has previously debated other documents relating to enlargement and has raised these matters. It is not as if Ministers did not know about the dawning problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Long before enlargement becomes a reality, Agenda 2000 is supposed to do something about the agriculture support, not, of course, about the total amount given to agriculture but about how it is given, with a move from production subsidies to land grants. If that movement had begun, it would have been reflected in the figures, but clearly it has not, because the opposite has happened and there has been an increase in the support mechanisms. One effect is that our net contribution is rising, because our receipts are not keeping pace with our gross contribution. The abatement is a red herring because it is two thirds of the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that there are other causes, but efforts with a pocket calculator were not sufficient to verify that. I started to look for other causes for the change in our net contribution and for where else budget lines had gone up without being matched with receipts. I had only a few hours in which to do that last night, and I freely admit that I may simply not know enough about how these things work, but I could not find an explanation for the difference. Perhaps the Minister has an explanation, but she would not admit that there is a difference. We certainly need an explanation. If it is structural, there is a persistent problem, because our net contribution will continue to rise or stabilise at a significantly higher level than previously. If it is transitional—as a result of adjustment of structural funds or because we were not very good at obtaining receipts—the problem is not so severe and we can hope that someone will bring it under control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need answers to those questions. I despair of the Minister telling us anything today, and I do not want letters, because they are useless. We need someone in the Treasury—the Economic Secretary or, if she prefers, someone else—to do some homework and to find the reason for the great increase in our net contribution. She should try to work with her colleagues on the other relevant councils and apply the necessary pressure to return us to a position that is parallel to that of a year or two ago. That is not an heroic or ambitious target, but if Ministers will not even bother to find out what is in the documents, they will not achieve even that modest objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Committee has any purpose—apart from the questions about Kosovo, I doubt that it has—I hope that it will be to make it clear to the Economic Secretary that there is a real problem here. I hope that my hon. Friends and I will be able to afford Ministers the opportunity to speak about these matters in greater detail, perhaps in Opposition day debates. I also hope that there will be public debate when we bring these great rises to the public's attention in the coming days. There certainly needs to be, and Ministers certainly need to go back and do some homework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to talk quietly and succinctly to a Treasury Minister and Treasury officials about the situation in the Balkans. I believe that Ministers are misinformed in a number of respects. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) and I recently spent 35 minutes alone with the Prime Minister—it is to his credit that he agreed to see us. I say alone, but he was with Michael Tatham, his foreign affairs private secretary, and his parliamentary private secretary. As a result, having given us a very good hearing, the Prime Minister sent a report. After reading that report, I am greatly alarmed at the impression that members of the British Government are being given about the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a national service man, I was a member of the Royal Scots Greys, as they then were. They have now metamorphosed into the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. I have a warm relationship with them, and went to stay with them in Bosnia. Subsequently, I visited them in Serbia with my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax and, last week—again at their invitation, although I paid the air fare and am beholden to no one—I went to stay with them in Skopje. It is against that background that I express my considerable alarm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One was protected there, otherwise it would have been very difficult to ask direct questions. I asked Kosovo Albanians how long they expected KFOR and the British Army to stay. Some said 20 years; rather more said for ever. That is the reaction at a fairly low level. Others have been there and, no doubt, spoken to Bernard Kuchner and other important people. I promise my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary that that was the reaction of Albanians in the street, on the ridges and in country areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
I hope that the Treasury realises that this is an extremely long commitment that has many implications. NATO leaders have referred in statements to the economic regeneration of the Balkans, which would be a vast commitment. For example, the biggest factory in Kosovo, which is one of three big nickel plants in Europe, was run by E1 Chem of Norway, and huge ingot bowls were made by Krupp. That huge, billion-dollar-plus installation was destroyed—now it is twisted metal and no employment is available there. The main source of income and of economic generation has gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation in Kosovo is better than that in Serbia. For 25 years or more, I represented the motor industry at Bathgate—I know my way around motor factories. The factory at Zastava was seven times the area of Bathgate. It produced, among other things, a car called the Yugo—not the most wonderful car in the world—at the rate of 240,000 a year. That factory—the biggest car factory in the Balkans—is now twisted metal and the 115,000 people who are out of work are sullen and resentful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We found a similar situation in Belgrade. Apart from the disease that might have been caused, the destruction of a chemical plant at Pancevo was a terrible blow—my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax will bear that out. I earlier asked a question about the bridges at Novi Sad, but we also need to consider the oil refinery. What is to be done about that major issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak with such passion about this matter because there will be a rematch, not necessarily during my lifetime but during those of the hon. Member for West Dorset and my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. Although local people may hate Mr. Milosevic, who is not, to put in mildly, a nice man, they passionately believe that Kosovo is their heartland. When I met Bishop Artemje I understood how dire the situation is. We felt that there was a thirst for revenge in Serbia. That is why we need to adopt a long-term view and establish what can be done to stop Armageddon from breaking out again. The next time, the Russians might be rather less helpful. The situation is fraught with danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Bosnia, it is one thing to put an army in, but it is another to pull an army out. I might be told, "This is a matter for the Department for International Development." I am going to see the Under-Secretary at 1.30 pm to put similar points from the Army's standpoint. I might be told, "This is a matter for the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence." So it is, but by heavens that commitment is also a matter for the Treasury. This may not be the appropriate occasion for it, but we need a statement about what will be done about the regeneration of the Balkans. The situation on the Danube is absolutely desperate—unless something is done, there will be further trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister used the word "misspent" to describe the funds that go to Kosovo. I ask Customs and Excise and the Treasury to take a very careful look at exactly where those funds go. Considerable resentment was aroused among the troops and officers of the Dragoon Guards, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
ancillaries, by what they—and I—saw with their own eyes: plush houses going up in areas where the KLA is concentrated. The KLA has been brutal not only to the Serbs, but to the Roma, to the gypsies, and to Albanians who do not agree with it. There is a strong belief among KFOR forces that funds are being channelled off to places to which they should not be channelled off, and that funds from the west are being corrupted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may get a different view from Unicef and from colleagues. However, she should take into account the great suspicion of those who are doing six-month tours, and have been asked to do the same tours next year and possibly for many years after that. That commitment may have huge defence implications if retention in the forces becomes more difficult—as well it might, because Kosovo is not an easy place to serve. I am ex-tank crew, and, as a teenager, wore tank suits to scramble around tanks. Today's tank suits are a bit better, as is much Army equipment, but imagine working, as some had to last week, in a tank park where the heat was 51 deg C, and the sun was beating down and reflecting on the white gravel. It is one heck of a posting. The overall defence implications of that commitment should be considered, and I hope that serious discussions will take place with the Ministry of Defence about what it entails.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has been generous in hearing me. The Treasury needs to be concerned about this matter, and I hope that the Minister and her officials will turn their attention to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Linlithgow made an important contribution of two halves, between which there is an important link. He began his remarks with a typically gallant defence of the Minister, and continued with a typically passionate and well-informed quizzing of the problems and deficiencies that have occurred in Kosovo, and the performance of the European Union in that sad country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The link concerns the effectiveness, or otherwise, of the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset—whose views on Europe do not, I regret to say, by any means coincide with mine—made a brilliant demolition of the task that the Committee was set. It was clear to us beforehand that the Committee was not equipped to fulfil that task, and that was made clearer by my hon. Friend's contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mean no disrespect to the Minister, and pay tribute to her qualifications. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood said, the fact that she is so well qualified, and yet was placed in such a difficult position in failing to respond to perfectly legitimate questions—mostly from Conservative Members, but also from Labour Members—demonstrates the strength of the case made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset and the need to consider calmly where we ought to be. Members of the public
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
who have been following our proceedings since half-past 10 must be completely confused about what we are doing. We are failing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was, again, in great difficulty with the questions asked by the hon. Member for Linlithgow about Kosovo. She did not give coherent answers to those crucial questions. She referred to what the Foreign Secretary or the Secretary of State for International Development might do, and said that the Treasury did not really know, although it keeps a watching brief on all of the Government. We hear the tired old phrase "joined-up government", but this morning we had a good example of government that is far from joined-up. We have had another manifestation of the ineffectiveness of the Committee. It is no good the Economic Secretary saying that she will write to us about this or that; we all know that such things run into the sand. That is not how Parliament is meant to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament is under a great threat; all hon. Members understand that, although some are more sensitive to it than others. Committees such as this represent one of the ways in which Parliament can be seen to work. However, that will not happen if, a few hours before we meet, we are given documents that are hundreds of pages long. The Treasury, with all its might, experience, manpower and intellectual horsepower, cannot provide the Economic Secretary with the answers. I do not expect the Economic Secretary to give substantive answers to our charges today, but I hope that the usual channels will consider the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe strongly that this country should be an active and positive functioning member of the European Union. The hon. Member for Linlithgow and I have a common view on that, and on many other matters. I want the European Union to work, and I have been involved, as an official in the diplomatic service and as a Foreign Office Minister, in trying to make it work. Clearly, things are getting worse, and that situation must be ended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.12 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow for, once again, drawing attention to these important matters. In politics, one must say things many times before they have any impact, and, apart from my hon. Friend and one or two other Labour Members, few hon. Members are saying much about Kosovo. Had the EU nations realised 10 years or more ago what was going to happen, they might have acted differently and done everything possible to prevent the break-up of Yugoslavia and the consequent horrors. We have a moral duty to make some payment, by way of compensation, for some of the mistakes that the European Union and member states have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although he acknowledged that the matters raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow were important, the hon. Member for West Dorset dismissed most of the other questions asked by hon. Members, including me. It was unfair of him to do that so lightly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if, in my petulance, I conveyed that impression. I did not mean to dismiss the questions; it was the answers that I was dismissing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. I think that my questions were important, and they set the scene for what I shall say now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that there was no point in trying to deal with this mass of documentation today, and, with a slip of the tongue, that it should be left to officials in Brussels. I would certainly not want to leave everything to officials in Brussels. We have a responsibility to ensure that public expenditure by the United Kingdom Government is at least handled properly in the interests of the electorate. Previous discussions in this Committee have suggested that our scrutiny, inadequate though it may be, is better than in other EU member states. I would like it to be improved, but we are doing our best with the pressure of time and the enormous amount of documentation. I was certainly able to draw out some important points from the documentation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the fourth time that I have debated an EU budget and I make the same points each time because they must be made many times if they are to have any impact. If they are made once, they disappear into the ether, but if they are made many times people eventually start to listen. I hope that my comments today will be listened to with interest and that my hon. Friend the Minister and her colleagues in the Treasury will take some action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have rightly taken a strong line on the Commission's proposals to go above its promised spending levels. I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that other member states feel equally strongly and that they will not acquiesce to the Commission's proposals but will make a serious attempt to deal with its proposed increased spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem must be dissected because we cannot put a clamp on all spending. I again draw attention to the problem of agriculture spending. I have not seen the details, but I am convinced that the EU's level of spending on agriculture is not only too high and bloated, but unbalanced. Contributions cause inequity among member states, particularly Britain, because we are at a disadvantage from the subsidy arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its manifesto, the Labour party suggested fundamental reform of the CAP. I agree with that, but the reforms proposed so far are far from fundamental. What I mean by fundamental is a new system of agriculture subsidies that is more effective and fairer between member states and provides appropriate subsidies to those sectors of agriculture that require it. I recognise that some sectors do not require subsidies, but others do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want my hon. Friend the Minister to respond to this thought at the moment, but, as I said to her predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West, we should think about abandoning the price maintenance system and re-introduce deficit financing arrangements and perhaps even a component of subsidiarity—in other words, renationalising the agriculture subsidy arrangements. That would benefit the majority of member states,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
although some would lose. I suspect that Ireland and Denmark would lose, but they are net recipients of EU funding, although their living standards are higher—in Denmark they are much higher—than in Britain and we are net donors to the European budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider fundamental reform of agriculture subsidies, and enlargement will reinforce that. We cannot spread the CAP further across an enlarged EU. It would be acceptable to have arrangements for subsidising agriculture at national level with fiscal transfers from richer nations to poorer nations, but it would not be acceptable to keep in place arrangements that continued the present distortions, whereby richer nations are net recipients and poorer nations are net donors. Enlargement could lead to much greater disadvantage for Britain. I do not know how formal this is, but Commission officials have suggested that the structural support arrangements that currently benefit Britain would have to go as they could not be afforded if they were spread across the whole of the enlarged Community. It would clearly be very costly for Britain if the CAP were maintained in its current form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could argue that within a community of nations there should be fiscal transfers from the richer nations to the poorer nations based on fair and equitable arrangements, but it is unacceptable to have arbitrary structures in place that disadvantage some nations and seem not to touch others, such as Denmark, which do not receive many structural funds and do well out of the CAP. It would not work and politically it would be damaging. Those who want the EU to succeed and the community of nations to work together agreeably recognise that having inequitable financing arrangements and distortions where some nations lose arbitrarily and others gain unjustifiably would not be a good way forward. It could lead to dissension in the ranks. Our Government and other Governments must look seriously at a fundamental reform of the CAP. I hope that my suggestions will not be dismissed out of hand but will be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could speak at great length on other more detailed matters in the documents today, but that can wait for another time. I simply draw attention once more to the fact that agriculture expenditure, as a proportion of total spending, seems set to rise and structural spending seems set to fall. That is the opposite of the trend in recent years when agriculture took up two thirds of the budget. It is down to 43 per cent. It is set to rise again, rather than to fall. I hope that our Government, and my hon. Friend the Minister, will press hard for that figure to come down so that the trend towards lower spending on agriculture and higher structural spending continues, rather than the reverse, as the financial perspectives for 2000–2006 seem to show. Although it is difficult to read all the documents, we can draw out some significant points from them. We can arm our Ministers for their discussions in debates with their counterparts in Europe and we can derive some benefit from our deliberations this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.23 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not always realise how lucky we are to serve on this Committee. We have you, Mr. Benton, in the Chair today and the Committee, for all its deficiencies, fulfils an admirable educative function; but, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset so eloquently put it, the function appears wholly unintelligible to our electors. If the scrutiny of EU budgets is so manifestly ineffectual, they will, I am sure, have little confidence not only in us as parliamentarians but in an institution of the EU that can produce a dossier of this magnitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Democracy in the EU is weighed. It has its avoirdupois, but it is not the democracy that hon. Members would understand. We are unable to change the preliminary draft budget. Indeed, we might as well have a talking head instead of a Minister replying to our questions and interventions. Of course that would be disagreeable, and we are delighted to see in Committee the Economic Secretary, who brings intelligence, charm and grace to our proceedings, but we are ultimately none the wiser. The electorate will have little confidence in the House as an institution or in the European Union, whose preliminary draft budget we are scrutinising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Si monumentum requiris, circumspice, the Romans used to say: if you want to judge the nature of an edifice, look around you. I did that a few weeks ago when I walked across the bridge in Strasbourg, where I spent 11 and a half happy years at the Assembly of the Council of Europe. I was brave enough to try to enter the monumental palace of the new European Parliament, which was opened at the beginning of the year by President Chirac. As it was one of the three weeks out of every four when the Parliament is inoperative, I thought that the doorkeepers would not allow me in—not so, they were most courteous. Inside, there is a huge plaza at the front before one enters the main atrium. It is clear that no expense has been spared on that building, just as no expense has been spared in the preliminary draft budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A 72 per cent. increase is proposed as a consequence of the grant of aid to the west Balkans, although, as the hon. Member for Linlithgow made clear, much of that money will disappear down the black hole of fraud and corruption. The second biggest percentage increase is in the anti-fraud provisions, which have been doubled. There will now be 300 officials working for OLAF. However, I am sure that, despite their diligent endeavours, the Court of Auditors will fail to sign off the accounts each year because some 10 per cent. of the moneys will have gone walkies. I have served on this Committee for many years, and know that that is the running average, which I am sure will not change. Our electors are right to be cynical, but so many of them have given up. They have given up on the EU as an institution and I am sad to say that increasingly large numbers of them are giving up on our Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury has been helpful. It has distilled information from the dossier into a memorandum dated 5 July, which includes some killer points, as the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
Prime Minister likes to call them. I shall quote a few to demonstrate how the budget is rising inexorably upwards. Paragraph 1.7 states:
	<br><q><p>Commitment appropriations in the PDB total 96,924 million euro, 3.9 per cent. above the 2000 Budget. Payment appropriations are 93,874 million euro, 5 per cent. above the 2000 Budget. The public expenditure forecasts in the Member States for 2001, which serves as a reference for the preparation of the PDB shows an increase of 3.1 per cent. The overall financial perspective ceiling is 97,352 million euro—328 million euro above the proposed level of commitments—</p></q>
in other words, upwards, significantly above the retail prices index in the United Kingdom, and more in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Category 4 relates to external action. The document states:
	<br><q><p>Total commitments proposed are 4933 million euro, 3 per cent. up on 2000 and above the financial perspective set for that category (4735 million euro.) This reflects the significant increase of 342 million euro (72.6%) proposed for assistance for the Western Balkans.</p></q>
Paragraph 1.15 relates to proposed commitments for category 5, which covers administration. European Union administration always interests me, as it does our electors. Those commitments
	<br><q><p>are up by 4,861 million euro (3.4%). If pension increases are excluded, the increase is about 2.5 per cent.</p></q>
We know that pension increases should not be excluded; we have to pay for them—as should be borne in mind. The paragraph continues:
	<br><q><p>The budget proposed for OLAF would increase to 34%—</p></q>
I apologise for having done an injustice; it was only 34 per cent.—
	<br><q><p>to 34.7 million euro, as a result of 767 new posts (bringing its total to 300) and expenditure on buildings—</p></q>
buildings for OLAF—
	<br><q><p>and IT systems.</p></q>
I should have thought that those officials would be out in the field in the member states working alongside national civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1.20 of the document states:
	<br><q><p>As regards the financial implications of the PDB for the UK, the Minister says:</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"The Government expects that the UK's euro financing share of the 2001 PDB will be around 19.6% before abatement—</p></q>
19.6 per cent? We pay almost one fifth of the European Union budget before abatement—
	<br><q><p>and 13.98% after abatement. The UK gross contribution in 2001 will be around 18.3 billion euro or 13 billion euro after abatement. This compares with a share of some 176.5% before abatement and 13.54% after abatement in the 200 Budget. The UK's actual contribution in 2001 will therefore be significantly lower after the abatement".</p></q>
But of course the abatement comes in the following year, as the other Treasury memorandum pointed out. We talk about the EU in railway terms. I do not know why, but that is always the metaphor. The train is clearly out of control: the expenditure is growing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), whose intellectual honesty I have always admired, and whose assiduity in attending these Committees is admirable, highlighted the problems with agriculture, as did my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset. The system of agricultural support in the EU is incompatible with the United Kingdom's national interests; it is incompatible with an appropriate system
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
of agricultural trade worldwide. Why, otherwise, would the banana war still be raging? It continues unabated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset demonstrated the way in which support for Mediterranean-type agriculture products does little, if anything, to help our farmers. Having represented a Bradford seat in my earlier days in the House, I have long had an affection for the Pennines and I have a house there still. Hill farmers in the UK are going bust. They certainly do not benefit from the tobacco or olive oil regimes. This is a national tragedy and a disgrace. It is noteworthy that none of the other free trade arrangements around the world such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mercosur, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation and the Andean Pact has this apparatus for the agglomeration of central power; none has a programme of diminishing democratic control over budgetary processes. I suspect that eventually the taxpayers of this country will get fed up, as did the taxpayers of the American colonies in 1776 and as did our forebears in the 17th century with the determination of King Charles I to raise taxes without the approval of Parliament. I hope that there will not be a war of the British secession, but the British public must be very fed up by now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.35 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well acquainted with the debating style of the hon. Member for West Dorset. I have sat opposite him many times in Committee over the past year and it is fair to say that he much enjoys speaking at length. I do not always share hon. Members' enjoyment of his speeches, because they are not very much to the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to copying errors and inconsistencies in the papers. It will not surprise him to learn that I was not personally responsible for copying the papers. I apologise if there are any errors in the paperwork, but there has been a limited time in which to produce such large documentation. Given that we are here to discuss policy and the use of taxpayers' money, I found some of the hon. Gentleman's remarks quite extraordinary. If we compare the detailed points that he was making with those that we would expect from a managing director, a chief executive or the chairman of the board of a large company when discussing accounts, we would be struck by the ridiculousness of some of his arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood slipped into confusion. We must not compare the 2000 adopted budget and the 2001 PDB because they are not comparable documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard year after year that we cannot compare X with Y. If we cannot compare anything with anything, we will never learn anything. If the two budgets cannot be compared, why are they so compared in the Treasury's memorandum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it is useful to set out information describing each budget and to make what comparisons can be made. However, they are not strictly comparable, and that is not recognised—either deliberately or otherwise—by Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, why did the Treasury not set out the 2000 PDB that is directly comparable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing the figures that are in front of us today. I am sure that other figures can be compared, but the comparisons raised cannot be made because the draft supplementing amending budget—the DSAB—includes the underspend from the previous year, whereas the PDB does not. That is what affects the calculations. Hon. Members in all parties must recognise that part of the problem of making such comparisons is that many member states and a large number of gross national products and receipts are involved. Calculations are made on time scales that are often interim and adjusted, as they always have been. To listen to Opposition Members, one would think that a radical change had taken place. The hon. Member for West Dorset spent time as an adviser to the previous Government, so he knows this full well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset referred to the 79 million euro in the PDB for 2001, in relation to the Economic and Social Committee. That is a cut on the 2000 figure of 2 million euro, or 2.5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members touched on agricultural expenditure. It is important that we understand that spending on the traditional common agricultural policy—the direct aid and market support—is set at 39.6 billion euro, which is about £24.8 billion. It is 430 million euro below the level of the Berlin sub-ceiling. The Budget Council is likely to cut the figure further. Hon. Members present at last year's debate raised that matter. From reading the debate, I recollect that it involved the hon. Member for West Dorset, who was aware that the target was the same as the ceiling only in relation to some areas of expenditure. In all other areas of the European Union's budget, the expenditure is set below the ceiling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary cannot go on dealing with the issue in that way. We debated the subject last year and the previous year. The paper proposed by the Commission showed that, in the budget for 2000, the analogous figure was 36.8 billion euro, which was a rise between the budget for 2000 and the preliminary draft budget for 2001 of 7.4 per cent. A minimum amount of obfuscation will eliminate any confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the traditional common agricultural policy figure is 39.6 billion euro, which is below the level of the Berlin sub-ceiling. Spending on rural development is set at 4.495 billion euro, which is £2.8 billion. That is at the level of the sub-ceiling. Actual spends are affected by agricultural market development, and later in the autumn the Commission will draw up the usual letter rectifying its original estimates. The Budget Council is likely to cut further the sums about which we are talking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
The hon. Member for West Dorset also made a point about market support, which made no sense. The overall CAP budget has been increased because of rural development measures. I explained before that that relates to a point made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. The result will be a total budget reduction by 2006. We will still pursue further opportunities to continue the reform process started at Berlin, and I have made several remarks to suggest that we think that it has not nearly gone far enough. For example, it will be important to commit to reform of the sugar regime. We are keen to have such commitments instituted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Economic Secretary promising that we will be back at last year's level or below it by the date that she mentioned, notwithstanding the 7.4 per cent. rise this year against last year's budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure to which date the hon. Gentleman refers. I referred to a reduction by 2006, which is the period of the budget considered as a result of the Berlin arrangements. We are looking forward over the next five or six years and the result will be a total budget reduction over that period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Economic Secretary pleased with the European Union's sugar subsidy scheme? Is it appropriate to use taxpayers' money to subsidise the export of sugar grown within the EU to the detriment of sugar produced in developing countries, where standards of living are much lower?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that we need to consider reform of sugar subsidies. I give a commitment that we shall argue further for that in future. Given the hon. Gentleman's remarks, I hope that we shall receive support from Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the rural development 2000 figure is set below the ceiling, because member states need approval for plans before they can be implemented. For 2001, the rural development aspect of the agriculture budget has been moved from the structural to the agriculture area. That is why the overall figure on agriculture is larger and the budget appears to be larger. A lot of the projects started in 2000 will be up and running for the whole of 2001, so the expenditure will be set at the ceiling, which will be equivalent to the full year's expenditure in 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood held up two pages about the Economic and Social Committee. I commend his attention to detail, but he missed some further points. One page referred to the Economic and Social Committee's core structure; the other referred to the joint organisational structure that that Committee used to have with the Committee of the Regions. That explains the two different figures. They are not comparable; they have different headings, as is clear from the text.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To save the Minister wasting her breath, I point out that I did not refer to any such document; nor did I discuss it. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset did so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's help. I refer my previous remarks to the hon. Member for West Dorset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I highlight the key factor: the Economic and Social Committee's budget for 2001 is proposed to fall from 81 million euro in 2000 to 79 million euro in 2001. The hon. Gentleman did not draw that point out of the figures, although what they show is perfectly clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the question about Macedonia, because I have not had an opportunity to answer it. Last year, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister pledged £5 million of aid to Macedonia. So far, £1.6 million has been committed. The Department for International Development is discussing the allocation of the remaining £3.4 million with the Macedonian Government. The £1.6 million that has been allocated has been focused very much on helping the Macedonians through their negotiations with the EU to improve trade and investment and support the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, with all the economic benefits that that will bring. We are discussing possible assistance; we also want to help to make progress on public administration and institutional reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow raised some general points about the Balkans. The long-term aim in respect of money spent in the Balkans is to normalise the countries and to allow them to run their own affairs, but the immediate focus is on ensuring that assistance produces economic and social benefits. We are not trying to rebuild the past; I appreciate my hon. Friend's anxieties, but we are concentrating on putting institutions in place that will be important in creating market economies. We are working with and through the international institutions, not alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend rightly assumed that several matters of policy are for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence. I assure him that the Treasury always has an interest in the financial consequences of decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend spoke from great knowledge and experience of the area about the troops in the region. We have 3,500 troops attached to KFOR in Kosovo and the region, about 7.5 per cent. of the total number of troops in the area. As I said before, it is important to make Kosovo a functioning economy, as much will flow from that. The reconstruction of some of the less glamorous structures is important—the creation of legal and banking systems, for example, and the other things that help to create a fully functioning market economy. Much is being done to rebuild a civil society; schools and health centres are being rebuilt and work is being done with the police and local government.

my hon. Friend to have a word with my hon. Friends the Members for Halifax, for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) and for Wolverhampton, South-West. Those ladies know far more than I do about prostitution in that country and the trafficking of women, which is the most important aspect of the problem, apart from the Albanian diaspora being the greatest ever purveyor of drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his further remarks. I often talk to our hon. Friends, and I shall discuss the matters that he raises with them.

As to the clearance of the Danube, there is a European Commission proposal that the European Union should fund 85 per cent. of the cost of clearing damage to the bridges at Novi Sad, as proposed by the Danube commission. The United Kingdom supports the EU proposal and expects it to advance shortly. Parliament has, I believe, been consulted on these matters. Clearly, however, it is a matter principally for the Foreign Office. I am straying, probably wrongly, into its domain by making such remarks. I hope that they are helpful in the context of the points raised in this debate.

In relation to enlargement, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood raised the Berlin agreement. The agreement will ensure firm limits on EU spending, which will also apply within enlargement. That point has been taken on board. Firm allocations have been made for spending on agriculture when new members join. Clearly, continuing reform of the common agricultural policy and reform of agricultural activity in would-be member states are important components in ensuring that the arrangements work well in future.

Abatement has increased by 1.8 billion euro, which reflects our gross contributions and receipts, as the hon. Member for West Dorset mentioned. The comparison is between the draft supplementing amending budget and the PDB—between 2000 for the draft and 2001 for the PDB—given all the caveats to which I referred earlier. The abatement broadly refunds two thirds of any difference between our gross contributions and receipts, as explained in the explanatory memorandum, which he discussed at considerable length. A short and clear summary is included in the annexe—or whatever it is called—to the explanatory memorandum.

I would not want to deny that our gross contributions in euros are increasing before the abatement. However, our net contribution in sterling, while rising as a result of economic growth, remains consistent. It will not rise significantly, as the hon. Gentleman fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How did the abatement rise by 50 per cent. in a year without the net contribution having risen by a similar or almost identical amount?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said previously, the abatement is calculated a year in arrears, and our receipts are not paid at the same exchange rate as our contributions. The latter are fixed at the last working day of the preceding year, whereas receipts operate on a different basis. Nothing has changed in that regard—it was the same under the previous Government. It is a difficult problem, and I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's difficulties in getting to grips with it. That is how the calculations work, and that has not changed in the past few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not realise that the inherent complexity of those mechanisms, balancing systems and abatements militates against our electorate having confidence that the European Union's budgetary processes are under control? Those processes should be transparent, clear and intelligible to the widest possible section of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are clear in many respects. However, making various adjustments to the budgets as a result of having to calculate and estimate certain figures—the real figures are fed in later on, some of which are also subsequently adjusted—makes it more difficult to pin down the exact detail. I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point, and this Government have done a huge amount to make such processes in the UK as transparent and clear as possible, such as publishing documents that were not published by the previous Government. The system will always be complicated, however, as budgets and contributions are based on whatever number of member states the European Union has at a given time. The number of countries to take into account means that it is not as simple a job as a member state's home budget. The trend forecast for average net contributions in 2001-02 has not changed significantly as a result of the PDB.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
