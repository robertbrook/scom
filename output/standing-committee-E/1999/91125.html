<p>[<i>Relevant Document: European Union Document No. 8450/99.</i>]</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the Minister to make her opening statement, I have a brief word to say about the scope of the questions and the debate. The scope of the documents is fairly wide, but there is one exception. European Union proposals relating to taxation of energy projects, which is one of a number of issues referred to in document 8484/1/99, were specifically considered by the Committee on 27 October, so they should not be covered in this debate.</span></p>
<p>4.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased to appear before you today, Mr. Gale, to discuss these very important documents on taxation and on the financial services action plan. We have, of course, discussed the proposals in the tax documents several times before, both in a Standing Committee debate on harmful taxation on 26 November 1997, and when I gave oral evidence to the European Scrutiny Committee on 23 June this year. It may, however, be helpful to cover the background to the tax proposals again briefly.<br><br>
In 1996, at the Verona Council, a Commission communication on the development of tax systems drew attention to the problem of harmful tax competition for the first time. This Commission communication, which was accepted by the then Conservative Government, recommended that a permanent group be established to oversee tax policy co-operation within the EU. The taxation policy group was born shortly thereafter.<br><br>
By the time of the Economic and Finance Council on 1 December 1997, it was clear that there was continuing support for the need for co-ordinated action at European level to tackle the problem of harmful tax competition.<br><br>
In the time that had passed since the Verona Council, the taxation policy group had developed a number of proposals in the field of direct taxation. Those proposals were presented to the Council, which decided that the proposals could help achieve certain objectives, such as reducing continuing distortions in the single market, preventing excess losses of tax revenue or getting tax structures to develop in a more employment-friendly way.<br><br>
The proposals are contained in "A package to tackle harmful tax competition in the European Union". It has three elements: a code of conduct on business taxation; a proposal for a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
made between associated companies of different Member States; and a proposal for a directive to ensure a minimum of effective taxation of savings income within the Community.<br><br>
ECOFIN also agreed to make regular progress reports to the European Council on tax policy cooperation from the end of 1998. We are discussing today the second such progress report submitted to the Cologne European Council.<br><br>
The code of conduct group was established to examine potentially harmful tax measures in EU member states. The code should create a more level playing field for businesses in Europe, strengthening the single market. This will protect United Kingdom employment and encourage investment into the UK.<br><br>
The European Scrutiny Committee's 28th report comments that it is concerned about the confidentiality requirement surrounding the work of the group. I assure members of this Committee that there were very valid reasons for insisting on confidentiality.<br><br>
ECOFIN understood that publicising the group's on-going work would be prejudicial to the proper consideration of these sensitive issues. It would make it much more difficult to achieve a successful outcome. That said, I am pleased to say that now that the central work of the group is largely complete, the Government will press the Council for the final report of the code of conduct group to be published in full.<br><br>
The European Scrutiny Committee's report does not raise any questions or concerns about the interest and royalties directive. Indeed, I have heard little said against the directive in any forum in the UK. The Government support the proposal and have taken an active role in arriving at the present text. The directive is now in line with our double taxation treaties.<br><br>
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the draft directive on the taxation of savings. The Government agree with the Committee that the draft directive, which is aimed at individuals, would have the unintended side effect of seriously damaging the European Union's financial markets, especially the international bond market based in the City of London.<br><br>
Members of the Committee will be aware that the UK produced a paper on the effects that the directive would have on the international bond market, which was presented to the Council in September. Copies of that document have been placed in the Library. The paper emphasises that the directive's approach to the problem will not only damage the international bond market but fail to tackle tax evasion effectively. We believe that global exchange of information is the best approach.<br><br>
It is the continued insistence by some member states and other important third countries on banking secrecy that prevents a solution to such tax evasion. Accordingly, the UK paper on international bonds proposed that international bonds be excluded from the scope of the directive, in order to safeguard the competitiveness of the European Union financial markets.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0743">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Today's debate also covers the action plan on financial services. Over the past 12 months, we have seen considerable activity in taking forward the single market in financial services. During the UK's presidency, the Government argued actively for, and launched in tandem with the European Commission, an initiative at the York ECOFIN meeting to bring about such a market. The Government therefore welcome the Commission's action plan, believing that it provides an excellent platform for further progress.<br><br>
The Government believe that a single market free of unnecessary regulation and rules that favours domestic providers will bring enormous benefits not only for UK financial services but for business and consumers. With the removal of barriers, a single market will enhance competition, give businesses greater choice on how and where to raise investment capital and give consumers a greater choice of products designed to meet their needs and a better return on their savings. It will also allow financial firms to trade in larger markets and provide what consumers want rather than what national laws and regulations require. That will make it easier for firms to get started, to grow and thus to create jobs. The Government are actively participating in taking that plan forward. That concludes my brief opening remarks, Mr. Gale, and I shall be happy to answer questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 5.30 pm at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time, Given the number of Members present, there should be ample opportunity for hon. Members to ask more than one question, but the Minister must have the chance to answer them individually.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for her introductory remarks and for the documents that have been provided. They contain the traditional misprint: Wednesday 25 November is a date that does not exist. I hope that the millennium bug has not struck early.<br><br>
My main concern is that there is no recent explanatory memorandum. Next week, the Minister will be agreeing—or disagreeing—these measures, yet the last memorandum that we have is that of July 1999. That oversight is compounded by the needless secrecy that the European Scrutiny Committee deprecates in its report.<br><br>
Although a great many British and dependent territory measures are under scrutiny by the ministerial group on business taxes, we have not been provided with copies of those reports. Others have; the British Management Data Foundation received the complete list from the European Council. Why is it that others have the list of measures under scrutiny by the European committee chaired by the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), but the House and the public at large are denied that information? If the hon. Lady is serious about open government and the public's right to know, why has she not given us a recent report; and will she now repair that—at least before next week's ECOFIN meeting—by providing a full list of the tax measures under consideration?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the question of leaking of documents, the right hon. Gentleman has been told that those documents were provided for the Council. I have checked with the Council and the Commission and they both say that they did not release the documents. However, it is true that there are documents in circulation that purport to represent the progress of the work of the code of conduct committee<br><br>
On confidentiality, ECOFIN's decision of March 1998 was recorded in the official journal. As chair of that committee, I am bound by that decision. That puts me in a difficult position, but I have informed Parliament of the UK measures before the group. I have always said that I am utterly confident that we shall be able to demonstrate that those measures are not harmful, and I remain of that view. If needed, I can explain the analytical process that the group undertook when considering harmful tax competition.<br><br>
I am not aware of any outstanding explanatory memorandums. I have been told that we have provided the Committee with all the documents required. We had a little problem in the summer, but that has now been dealt with. As for the code, I have told the Committee that the Government will argue at ECOFIN on Monday that the report should be released and published. That will require a simple majority and I sincerely hope that the other members of ECOFIN will agree that it should now be available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Minister's opening remarks. Her Majesty's Treasury is conducting the negotiations with the stubbornness and firmness that we expect. Indeed, we are pleased to see it because important financial interests would be at risk if a withholding tax was imposed on those markets.<br><br>
We have been told that the negotiations on the proposed withholding tax are in deadlock. When does the Minister anticipate their conclusion? I know that it is difficult to say, because of the uncertainty. We are told that the meeting of Finance Ministers on Sunday, prior to Monday's ECOFIN meeting, is likely to be cancelled because of the recent failure to agree, but can the hon. Lady tell the Committee how long the negotiations will continue? People obviously want to be able to plan their business with certainty. The sooner the negotiations are successfully concluded, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So that we have it on record, I should say that the Government have always accepted that, whether as part of G7, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or the European Union, we should participate in measures to tackle tax evasion That is what the member states who support the draft directive want to achieve. Our argument has been that a side effect of the directive is that it would damage European financial markets, particularly the City of London. About 90 per cent. of the City's business is wholesale. The directive is not designed to cover that, and member states say that they are not targeting it. It constitutes about 65 per cent. of the global market in bonds. We have made it clear that unless eurobonds are exempted, to avoid that unintended side effect—which would be disastrous and would drive business out of Europe; it would be bad for Europe, let alone bad for the UK—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0744">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
we shall be unable to accept the directive as drafted because it would damage competitiveness. The directive should be based on exchange of information.<br><br>
For some time now, member states have been discussing our paper, which I am sure the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has read. The UK is not the only country to have problems with the directive, although hon. Members would not realise that from reading some of the press coverage. Even if the eurobond issue were settled, many other issues would remain. They include the definitions of interest payment and paying agent for the purpose of the directive; revenue sharing, which some member states favour; potential administration burdens on banks and paying agents; the relationship of the directive to existing tax treaties; the third-country problem of simultaneous adoption of equivalent measures; the investment fund issue, about which Luxembourg is worried; the directive's relationship with the directive on interest and royalties; the standards of provision of information that the directive would require; the nature of enforcement regimes; the appropriate rate of withholding, if that is adopted, which we oppose; and the implications of the co-existence model, which we believe would entrench banking secrecy and be very bad in international terms.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked me to speculate how long it would take to settle all those issues. I do not know, but the directive as drafted is fundamentally flawed and unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lepper <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Pavilion)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I welcome my hon. Friend the Paymaster General to the Committee. I had intended to raise the issue that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) raised. My hon. Friend mentioned the benefits to consumers of agreement on the directive on financial services. Will she expand on those benefits?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The action plan for financial services is designed to promote discussion. It is not designed to be voted on. It is not a directive order but part of discussions in progress. We especially favour it because we support the objective of a single market in financial services, as we do in goods, as does the City of London, which provides such a huge range of resources. The benefits to consumers include more choice in the types of services to which they would have access; security through protection; better pension prospects as a result of access to a variety of products; and easier access to capital for business, especially small and medium businesses and entrepreneurs who want their businesses to grow. However, a plan is only as good as its constituent parts. We have a plan, and we shall need to scrutinise the individual proposals extremely carefully. We must ensure that we protect consumer confidence without unduly burdening business, and we need to find a way that will benefit both parties. The action plan offers us the opportunity to take those proposals forward, which we intend to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wycombe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's suggestion that Britain is not the only one in the platoon in step on the matter of withholding tax,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
and that we might have allies on at least some subjects. Further information about that would interest the Committee.<br><br>
The Minister made several references to the importance of controlling and combating tax evasion—we all agree with that—and the importance of European Union member countries exchanging information. Is that not the way to go? The pressures for a withholding tax come from countries that are not at all confident in their national measures for raising and levying appropriate taxes. If they could improve their performance, would it not be reasonable to hope that they would accept the arguments made by the City of London and arguments about the damage that the proposal would do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises some important points. We should clearly understand that the motivation of member states that support the draft directive is beyond reproach. They seek to challenge tax evasion. The question is, what is the best way to deal with it?<br><br>
In 1989, the then Government voted in favour of ECOFIN conclusions that would provide a basis for improved exchange of information on savings income. Unfortunately, that was vetoed by Luxembourg, which did not then support exchange of information. That is why the debate continued and why we now have the possibility of a co-existence model with some withholding and some exchange of information.<br><br>
The UK Government and all the official Opposition parties have always been clear that the best way to proceed is by exchange of information. That is why we argued for it in the G7 and why we are making the argument in the OECD. It is also why we think it necessary that the European Union tackle the subject, because then we would be dealing with the matter on the widest basis possible and we would have transparency.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked for information about which member states object, but I cannot remember at exactly which ECOFIN meetings which member states said what. However, Luxembourg has made no secret of its extreme concern about individuals' investment funds. I think that the Netherlands and at least two other countries—if I remember which ones, I shall tell the hon. Gentleman—favour revenue sharing. Other member states are concerned about paying agents. The discussion is still progressing, but for us the fundamental issue is that if we cannot sort out the principle about the exclusion of eurobonds at the beginning, there is no point engaging in the rest of the discussion. We believe that exchange of information is a much better way forward than the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being slightly late; knowing what the debate was about and knowing how many financial experts live in Kensington and Chelsea, I decided to spend some hours consulting them.<br><br>
Does the Minister agree that it is in our interests as well as those of the other member states to prevent tax avoidance of a type unforeseen in the tax code as well as outright tax evasion? We would therefore seek to support measures to reduce tax evasion, even if they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0745">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
affected areas such as the Channel Islands that are under British jurisdiction, so long as legitimate interests such as the bond market were protected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I understand the question; if not, perhaps my hon. Friend will prompt me when I have finished.<br><br>
My hon. Friend asked again about the Government's commitment to tackle tax evasion. Since 1997, we have shown how energetically we pursue the issue through legislation where we believe that there is evasion or avoidance. The recent announcement by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor on the CFCs legislation is an example of that. Our negotiations in other international forums are also important.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend also asked about our dependent and overseas territories. The matter is complicated. We cannot decide for such territories. We must be clear—we do not legislate for the territories on tax. They are autonomous. It would be unprecedented for us to do that. We work with them because it is in their as well as our interests that they comply with the highest international standards, particularly in the rapidly changing global economy. An example of that is cooperation with them on, for example, the money laundering directive; we did not have to comply with that, but we worked very closely with them and made good progress on it. My hon. Friend asked whether we could insist on enforcing the measures. The answer is no. We have to abide by our constitutional arrangements with dependent and overseas territories. However, we obviously encourage and support them, as we do with other states that comply with standards of financial behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister make it clear to her European counterparts that the Edwards committee looked into financial services regulation in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and gave the industries in those territories a completely clean bill of health? What she said was welcome, but can she also reassure the Committee that she will resist all the EU's attempts at fiscal aggression against and intrusion into the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands? Their fiscal affairs are nothing to do with the European Union—nor, for that matter, with the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Why does the Minister not save an awful lot of time and trouble, man hours and taxpayers' money by just telling the European Union that as the directive on the withholding tax is against British interests and would destroy jobs and damage our prosperity, we will have nothing to do with it and will veto it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's last point, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and Treasury Ministers, when they have been in front of Select Committees or Scrutiny Committees, have all made it absolutely clear that we will not agree to a draft directive that seriously damages financial markets, in particular the City of London. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have said that if that ultimately means using the veto, so be it. However, I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that nothing is on the table to be voted for yet. It is a long
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
and complicated discussion and we intend to take up that discussion with our European partners, to demonstrate that while committed to tackling tax evasion, we do not believe that this is the best way to go about it. That is why we have suggested amendments to the draft directive and, instead of the withholding tax, going straight for an exchange of information. That was the position of the Government in the 1 December conclusions and has been our position since.<br><br>
I repeat that members of the Committee should be clear that there is not yet anything on the table to vote for. There is still discussion and we are being asked to demonstrate why we believe effects will occur in the City of London. Indeed, representatives of the City of London themselves attended a meeting with the Commission and member states last week to put directly our concerns about the detailed issues. It is not open to us to do what the hon. Gentleman proposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In September, the Government published a paper setting out their objections not just to the 20 per cent. withholding tax but to the other option of requiring interest payers to supply information to other tax jurisdictions. The paper states at paragraph 36:
<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed directive is already having an impact on the market—there are signs of movement and evidence of nervousness which is reflected in the behaviour of investors and issuers. Swiss bankers have been reporting unprecedented capital inflows since the Spring of last year."</p></blockquote>
So the delay and prevarication are already damaging our capital markets.<br><br>
The Paymaster General says that the Government are anxious to bolster the Government's European credentials and show that they are listening and arguing, but meanwhile, damage is already being done. Why have the Government not made clear that they will veto any directive that includes any withholding tax or the option of requiring information exchange, which they have conceded would be damaging? Why are we witnessing a further erosion of British competitiveness and funds flowing out of the London market because they did not do what we did in 1989, namely, make clear in advance our intention of vetoing any such proposals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping to hear the right hon. Gentleman say how much he supports the detailed and excellent case that the Government and the City of London are urgently advancing with our European colleagues, and the frankness and directness with which they are doing so. I also hoped that he would agree with the press release issued by the representatives of the City after their meeting with the Commission and member states, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The industry representatives made clear that short of completely scrapping this ill-conceived and fundamentally flawed Directive"—</p></blockquote>
I have explained to the Committee why we also believe it to be flawed and ill conceived—
<br><blockquote><p>"the only approaches which the industry is prepared to accept are those put forward by the UK Government in its Paper on 'International Bonds'."</p></blockquote>
A footnote states that the London Investment Banking Association and the International Primary Market
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0746">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Association—the main industry representatives—have met on an on-going basis and discussed with the Government how to deal with the draft directive.<br><br>
It is difficult to know how much more forceful and clear the Government could be in putting our views to our European partners. The options that we have proposed—exchange of information or exemption—must be dealt with urgently. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor will certainly restate that view at ECOFIN.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is worrying that the official Opposition appear to oppose exchange of information to control tax evasion in Europe? Hot money will always flow to Switzerland, Belize or some other tax haven, but do we want that to be the centre of our business? The City does not, and I hope that the Government also consider fair exchange of information on a confidential basis to be in everyone's interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have always expressed the view that exchange of information is the best way forward—including in debates in the OECD and G7. I had understood that also to be Conservative party policy; it is certainly Liberal Democrat policy.<br><br>
We must protect the competitiveness of the City of London's financial market, which is not only good for the UK but good for Europe. That is why we argued for exchange of information in all the forums. The idea that 15 member states can deal with tax evasion is fundamentally flawed because we do not have control over third countries, which might not simultaneously want to adopt equivalent measures.<br><br>
I come back to the key issue—that we must be focused and clear about what is necessary to prevent the unintended side-effect of the draft directive on the eurobond market in the City of London. We should not underestimate or fail to recognise the strength of feeling of our European partners who desperately want to deal with tax evasion. I say again that exchange of information will let them deal with tax evasion and allow us to protect our City of London and its services from damage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I invite the Paymaster-General to elaborate further on why the Government are opposed to the co-existence model? Is it because of problems in distributing the resulting tax revenues, or is that only one of several concerns? Alternatively, is the major concern about information—for example, that countries such as Luxembourg would be unable to sign up to the information provisions? Might the assumptions contained in the co-existence model be viewed as old-fashioned, as the Minister implied in her initial answer, and fail to meet the sort of criteria that the British Government are seeking to ensure that banks and investors share with the tax authorities the information required to prevent evasion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To put it succinctly, the co-existence model would produce the wrong amount of tax in the wrong place with huge administrative burdens. All sorts of other complicated problems—regarding revenue sharing, for example—might also arise. What would be the obligation? What
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
information would be exchanged with whom? What happens to the revenue collected elsewhere? Although the directive appears to deal with those who want an exchange of information and those who would prefer a withholding tax, it actually provides a far more complex set of issues to deal with.<br><br>
The eurobond market in the City of London is a high-volume, low-margin market, and extensive administrative burdens would make it uncompetitive. If it is uncompetitive, the business will go elsewhere. That, in a nutshell, is the issue. The attempt to provide a compromise between those who wanted a draft on exchange of information and those who wanted a withholding tax has produced an apparent balance in the middle which creates problems of its own and takes us further from achieving the objective of dealing with tax evasion by individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the damage done to the City of London by any withholding tax would impact particularly on investments here in London by third-country, non-EU nationals? Can she say more about discussions with her European partners about that? Is there a method whereby the impact could be eased or avoided?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem with the way in which the draft directive is currently arranged is, as I said before—it is covered in our paper—that 90 per cent. of the eurobond business in the City of London is wholesale.<br><br>
Of the remaining 10 per cent., EU nationals make up 3 to 5 per cent. and are the subject of the draft directive. We need to get it across to our European partners that the current draft requires us to go through all 100 per cent. of the market to find the 3 to 5 per cent. That causes all the problems that I detailed earlier.<br><br>
Our approach has been to take eurobonds out, to define exactly what we are trying to deal with or to go for exchange of information. However, the focus would be only on EU nationals. Obviously, our view—and, I am sure, the hon. Gentleman's—is that anything that undermined the competitive advantage of the City of London would not be a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lepper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I return to Opposition Members' somewhat unexpected criticisms of the Government's approach in the negotiations? Have representatives of the City of London told my hon. Friend the Paymaster General or other colleagues that an approach other than the Government's—for instance, one along the lines that the Opposition suggest—would be more helpful to the City?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for the City of London, but I think that it wishes that the draft directive was not on the table at all. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] It wishes that the previous Government had been a little firmer; if they had, the draft directive would not have been on the table when we took over. I shall not embarrass Opposition Members at this point in the debate by asking them to recount all the things that they did. They agreed directives on direct taxation, but now say that those directives are wrong, and we agree with them. None the less, that is what they did. There are also the commitments that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0747">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Lord Lamont made at the end of the UK's presidency in 1992 to tackle harmful tax competition. The then Government also agreed the parent and subsidiary company directive on direct tax in July 1990.<br><br>
Article 4(3) states that the directive
<br><blockquote><p>"shall apply until the date of effective entry into force of a common system of company taxation."</p></blockquote>
I do not know what that means. I guess that the then Government were forecasting the harmonisation of corporation tax, which this Government are absolutely against.<br><br>
Some of the arguments advanced by Opposition Members are a little wide of the mark, but that does not distract or deter the Government from representing what we believe to be the UK's best interests. I have made it clear where we stand on the draft directive on savings taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister kindly explain why she appears so readily to have accepted the dreary European doctrine of harmful tax competition? Is it not the case that tax competition is a spur to greater efficiency and that it lowers costs? It will increase the market share of countries that enjoy lower rates of taxation and thereby bring greater prosperity to their peoples. Surely the Minister is expressing inconsistent points of view. She says that she wants the United Kingdom to maintain lower corporation tax than other European Union countries and that she does not want any increase in tax burdens on the City of London to damage its competitiveness. Yet, with no apparent intellectual criticism, she adopts the strange and dreary doctrine of harmful tax competition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little surprised by that. I could have sworn that a press release issued after the Conservative party conference in the autumn stated that the Conservative party was against harmful tax competition. Will the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) let us know if that is not so? However, in March a survey in the <i>Financial Times</i> reported that British business—and indeed, European business—was in tune with the Government's EU agenda in relation to tax issues. It stated that business opposed tax harmonisation—as does the UK Government—but was in favour of fair tax competition and was determined that the unanimity on tax issues should remain, which is basically a statement of Government policy.<br><br>
Fair tax competition means the absence of niche regimes, which provide a lower effective rate of taxation in the absence of real economic activity and give advantage to those acting against British business. British business wants a single market and to compete on a level playing field. Fair tax competition seeks to address those issues. On election, the Government inherited a negotiating position that we happened to agree with. In the OECD, the previous Government was against harmful tax competition and in favour of fairness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The ancien regime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help it if the hon. Gentleman does not support his own Government. He may plough his own furrow, but I am accounting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
for the present Government and the basis on which we are proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have enjoyed the party political skirmishing in which hon. Members of both parties have participated. However, I am sure that Dr. Palmer wishes to discuss the document under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to consider a subject that we have not yet discussed, the document entitled "Towards A Single Market For Supplementary Pensions". As the Paymaster General knows, most pension funds are required largely to match assets with expected benefits so that, for example, vast investments in yen do not pay out in pounds if the exchange rate deteriorates.<br><br>
The Commission's report proposes further discussions on the extent to which that can be modified, in view of the fact that most EU countries have decided to have a single currency. Does Britain welcome those discussions? They would, in principle, give our own pension funds much greater flexibility in deciding how to invest, thus benefiting one of our strongest industries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government welcome the Commission's efforts to identify barriers to the development of a single market in supplementary pension schemes. We welcome in principle the Commission's suggestion of a directive to implement a qualitative prudential framework for a supplementary scheme funded by the private sector. As I said, the development of such schemes would provide an important source of capital for business and help to deliver improved economic growth and job creation.<br><br>
In scrutinising developments in that area, matters relating to the action plan for financial services apply. The Government want to ensure that there will be a single market which is not undemocratic. We also want to reduce legislation from Brussels while retaining protection. We need to examine carefully a range of issues.<br><br>
We are proceeding with caution, but with enthusiasm about the potential benefits, while recognising that a number of big issues will need to be tackled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I return the Minister to the issue of the Crown and dependent territories, which are expected to fall into line with the conclusions of the ministerial group looking into so-called unfair tax competition. In 1997 the Government said that they were agreeing to the setting up of this group on the basis that they would respect and implement its conclusions. Therefore, to that extent they are bound by the decisions of the group that the Minister chairs. As she reminded us, the United Kingdom does not have the legal powers to implement the decisions in the dependent territories, which are autonomous in tax matters. How are the discussions progressing with these overseas territories? The Minister has had to report back to the council on this matter. What pressure or persuasion is she putting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0748">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
on the dependent territories to comply with the discussions and decisions to which they are not party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the right hon. Gentleman is probably aware of this, it is best to put this on the record. First, the code of conduct proceedings are not legally binding. They are voluntary. There can be no compulsion at the end of the process. Secondly, there cannot be votes in the code of conduct group. ECOFIN charged me as the chair of the group to produce a report that reflected the views of all member states, even when those views were contradictory or other member states believed that a view held by an individual member state was not accurate. The report must reflect everyone's views on all of the subjects.<br><br>
Secondly I refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraph M of the code, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Member States with dependent or associated territories or which have special responsibilities … commit themselves within the framework of their constitutional arrangements to ensuring that the principles of the code are applied."</p></blockquote>
I believe that the report that we submitted to explain our constitutional arrangements with overseas and dependent territories has been placed in the Library. Let us be clear. The Kilbrandon report of 1973 outlines our constitutional arrangements for the Crown dependencies and it is absolutely clear that they have autonomy over their tax issues.<br><br>
I think that behind the right hon. Gentleman's question is the question whether in isolation the overseas territories or the Crown dependencies will be forced to do something that no one else will be doing. That is not and cannot be the case. The injustice of that speaks volumes. If ECOFIN took the view that certain measures were harmful, there would need to be discussions. The idea that the dependent territories alone would have to do something is ridiculous.<br><br>
We are in constant communication with our Crown dependencies and overseas territories on a number of issues. I gave the example of the directive relating to money laundering, which they are also not obliged to comply with. They have done so because it is good international practice and they want to remain squarely within it. Discussion is important. We encourage the territories to conduct themselves to the highest standards in international finance, as we do ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the report of the group that considered the directive is published it goes to the ECOFIN council and is examined by Ministers. Will the report be published promptly after ECOFIN's meeting? The Paymaster General undertook to publish it, but it would be helpful to have an idea of the timetable. The report will make interesting reading, given that in her answer to the right hon. Member for Wells she said that it must reflect the views of all members of her group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not within my gift nor that of the European Commission to publish the report. ECOFIN will have to decide about that and, as I said at the outset, we shall encourage it to do so. In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
our view, the report should be published, but it is a matter for ECOFIN. I understand that the decision is by a simple majority; it does not require unanimity. Publication is not an issue for me or the Chancellor. It is for ECOFIN to decide. That is the what the UK will argue. Quite honestly, if ECOFIN does decide to publish I have no idea when it will happen, but I imagine that it will be quite quickly because it uses websites and other such vehicles. Obviously, we shall inform Crown dependencies and our overseas territories about where they stand on the issues in the report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In box 4 on page 14 of the pensions paper, the commission's report gives an interesting overview which indicates that in the long term countries which encourage pension funds to invest in equities—or at least do not create artificial barriers to investing in them—achieve much better performance. It is also suggested, based on the American experience, that that is beneficial for high-tech small and medium enterprises as well. For that reason, and in view of the shortage of gilt-edged securities in the long-term end of the market at the moment caused by the Government's prudent financial policies, does the Paymaster-General agree that it might be worth considering relaxing Britain's own rules in this area, which I understand tend to restrict the amount of investment that pension funds can make in private equities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears that in Kensington and Chelsea my hon. Friend had some good discussions about the document. Box 4 does not immediately leap out from the many papers before me. Perhaps I should cautiously say to my hon. Friend that the Government always look at ways of ensuring the security and continuing growth and success of our pensions industry. That is why we are very keen on the action plan: we believe that it will provide greater opportunities. Beyond that, I cannot go into detail on my hon. Friend's question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I return to the issue of the Crown dependencies? How is it that Her Majesty's Government permit any discussion of their fiscal status? In the case of the Isle of Man, I declare an interest as chairman of the British-Manx Group. The Isle of Man is not a member of the European Union, so the EU has no locus standi in Isle of Man affairs any more than the United Kingdom does in the Isle of Man's fiscal matters. Is it not true that the Isle of Man has an unemployment rate of less than 1 per cent., a balanced budget, no capital gains tax and many other benefits. How could Her Majesty's Government even consider a discussion on these matters in European Union circles? That is totally beyond the constitutional competence of the EU.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that the hon. Gentleman makes about European Union jurisdiction in the Isle of Man is correct. We have spelt that out to our European colleagues. Indeed, it was the subject of some debate when we scrutinised the code itself. We insisted in paragraph M that the member states had to understand the constitutional arrangements between ourselves and the Crown dependencies, including the Isle of Man. I assure the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0749">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
hon. Gentleman that we made our position crystal clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings us to the end of the time allocated for questions.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents Nos. 8484/1/99, the second progress report from the ECOFIN Council to the European Council on reinforced tax policy co-operation, 6615/98, a draft Directive on a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments, 8781/98, a draft Directive to ensure a minimum of effective taxation of savings income within the Community, and 8329/99, a Commission Communication on the action plan for implementing the framework for financial markets; supports the Government's objective of amending the draft savings Directive to ensure that competitiveness of EU financial markets, including the City of London, are not damaged, through securing among other things an exemption for eurobonds and other similar instruments; and welcomes the Commission's efforts to develop further the single market in financial services.—[<i>Dawn Primarolo.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>5.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even this short question-and-answer session has shown again the importance of the matters before us. The issue of tax harmonisation will come to a head next week at the ECOFIN meeting. I refer to the report on the code of conduct for business taxation and the draft directive on the taxation on savings and the proposed withholding tax. Both of those proposals are in their different ways extremely risky and very dangerous.<br><br>
On the question of the ministerial group, it has often been observed that tax harmonisation is always upwards. There is no recorded instance of the EU harmonising downwards. As we are generally a low-tax jurisdiction, we have the most to lose from the EU upward harmonising pressure.<br><br>
The Minister suggested that the Conservative Government set up the group. That is incorrect; it is, perhaps, unfortunate for the Minister that I tend to keep old documents. It is clear from the report of the Select Committee on European Scrutiny that we agreed to an analysis of the problem when the matter was first debated. The communication from the Commission at that time made no reference to unfair tax competition. All that was suggested was that a high level group of personal representatives, chaired by the Commission—not a Minister—should take forward the analysis. It is a completely different thing to set up an executive body to make representations that are binding in practice on member states. The Minister made it clear that the United Kingdom Government would respect and implement the decisions of the group that she chairs.<br><br>
The Code of Conduct group meets in secret. That cannot be good, either for public policy or the process of consultation. Again, the Select Committee was alarmed by that and said that it regretted that the first report from the code of conduct group was regarded as confidential and, therefore, escaped parliamentary scrutiny. The second report was unavailable for the same reason. The only report that we have on these important matters is the bland and uninformative report from ECOFIN in May. I shall give the Committee a flavour of that report. Paragraph 10 states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Group proposed and the Commission agreed that certain issues should be considered further in the Taxation Policy Group."</p></blockquote>
What group? Who sits on it? What are its powers? What "certain issues" are to be discussed? Where is the report? Where is the explanatory memorandum? It is therefore lucky that certain people do not accept that clampdown on government information.<br><br>
I have already mentioned the indefatigable Anthony Cowgill, MBE, the director of the British Management Data Foundation. He has obtained a copy of the report of the ministerial group. Contrary to what the Minister suggested, that is not a peculiar informal extract but the report of her group. It is in the traditional format. It has a reference number and a date. Interestingly, it lists all the taxation measures under review, with a description. Why were we not provided with that report? I have a copy simply because Mr. Cowgill knew that I was interested in the subject.<br><br>
It is a scandal that a Government who say that they are in favour of openness and the public's right to know will not publish basic documents that are available. They are not on the internet and they have not been leaked, as she suggested; people are able to obtain them directly from the Council in Brussels. That is an eloquent commentary on the Government's approach to tax policy and unfair tax competition,<br><br>
It is interesting that the work of the ministerial group is already having an effect. In the 1998 Finance Bill, the Government provided for 100 per cent. capital allowances for small businesses in Northern Ireland. They made much of it. The measure helped a part of the United Kingdom that needed greater business investment. In the report to which I have drawn attention, one of the matters under investigation is that capital allowance. A month later, during the Report stage of this year's Finance Bill, the Government made three significant amendments to the capital allowance regime for Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, that has nothing to do with what we are discussing today. Secondly, the amendment related to state aid rules, not the code of conduct group. Thirdly, state aid rules are treaty obligations that have been in the treaty since 1953. I seem to remember that the Government who took us into Europe were committed to those treaty obligations. The right hon. Gentleman suggests that the amendment was the work of the code of conduct group, but it was not; we introduced it because of the state aid rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I find myself in some difficulty. It is true that the right hon. Gentleman referred to a document that we are not discussing, but it is quite clear that he is also referring to a document that is, at least in part, in the public domain. I have to place on record the fact that the Chair deprecates the manner in which documents are leaked. I appreciate that it is not a Government document, but I hope that the hon. Lady will make it plain to those in ECOFIN with whom she deals that we regard this matter very seriously.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0750">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not use a leaked document. It was not leaked; it was legally obtained from the European Council. The Government will not publish it. I listened carefully to what you said, Mr. Gale. I, too, deprecate the fact that I have to tell the Committee about a document that is circulating throughout the rest of Europe but is denied to us.<br><br>
Returning to the matter before us, that document is extremely relevant because it shows that the matters affecting Northern Ireland capital allowances were under discussion and, a month later, the Government unusually tabled an amendment on Report to amend British legislation although the measure had been enacted only a year before. Therefore, they believed that that was right and necessary for the economy of Northern Ireland. The measure was then found to conflict with the unfair tax competition strictures of the ministerial code, so they had to amend it. I think that that is the first example—I hope the last—of the decisions of the House and the tax proposals of the British Government effectively being overruled by a European Union committee. That is not theory, nor the future; it is already having an effect.<br><br>
The document deals with 37 taxes in territories, such as Jersey, St. Helena, the Falkland Islands and the British Virgin Islands, that are under scrutiny. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) reminded us, those territories are not in the European Union. They are not represented in that committee, but it is effectively sitting in judgment on them. The Paymaster General has helpfully reasserted that they have autonomy; we cannot simply override their tax statutes. Therefore, why did the Government promise to implement the proposals and conclusions in 1997?<br><br>
In fact, the Paymaster General said that the Government would agree to the code only
<br><blockquote><p>"if it intended to honour it".</p></blockquote>
So it is beyond dispute that the discussions taking place in the group are not theoretical; the intention is to implement the proposals and the Government have undertaken to do so. That is repeated in the documents. The European Scrutiny Committee states that the UK
<br><blockquote><p>"will respect any decisions on UK tax measures as if they were legally binding."</p></blockquote>
It is extraordinary that the Government have undertaken to implement the findings of the ministerial group apparently without the legal powers to do so. I asked the Minister what pressure was being put—perhaps threats were being made—on those dependent and Crown territories, and she said that the Government were in discussion with them about several matters. That is not what is being said in some of those territories; they are extremely alarmed. Of course, they say that if a clampdown on such tax measures occurs in those territories, business will simply migrate—not, of course, to the European Union, but to other territories way beyond the EU's remit or any territory to which the EU supposes that its writ runs.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
It would be helpful if the Paymaster General would tell us more about the discussions, especially as the documents make it clear that she had to report back to the Council in Brussels. She should tell us exactly what has been going on because she has had to report on it already—again, apparently in secret.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware that matters are further complicated by the fact that Crown dependent territories' only direct constitutional link with the Government is through the Home Office, not the Treasury? When they seek to make representations to international bodies, such as the EU or the OECD, the bodies say that they have no locus standi and they have had great difficulty even being received by them. The position is perplexing, and my right hon. Friend is right to seek clarification from the Paymaster General.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend; he makes much more sense of the position than I do, especially given his connection with the Isle of Man. It is worrying that a secret Committee should effectively be sitting in judgment on territories that will undoubtedly be put under pressure to fall into line, despite the apparent lack of transparent or legal powers.<br><br>
The other issue is that of the withholding tax. There is a measure of cross-party agreement or support on what is recognised as the damaging proposal to levy a 20 per cent. tax on interest payments made between member states. That would be catastrophic. It would simply drive the bond market out of the United Kingdom—not to elsewhere in the EU, but to New York, Tokyo or Zurich; everywhere else, in fact, but the EU. That is another example of the EU's obsession with its internal arrangements and its ignorance of the wider global situation and of the competitive pressures faced by Europe as a whole.<br><br>
The alternative to a withholding tax is no better. There was confusion about that on the Benches behind the Minister earlier. The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) seemed to suppose that we were opposed to information exchange between tax authorities. We are not. Of course we expect that member states, and indeed other friendly countries such as the United States, should get together on matters of tax avoidance and money laundering, and exchange information where necessary. That is not at issue. The alternative to the withholding tax is called information exchange but is much more damaging; it is a requirement on the payers of bond interest to collect and provide information to other tax authorities in other member states about who is being paid and where they reside. As the Government have rightly spotted, the directive would have the same effect; the bond trade would simply leave London and the European Union. The onerous and expensive administrative requirements that it would entail simply make exchange of information out of the question. Also, the UK would be deprived of the tax revenue. If other member states go for the 20 per cent. withholding and we go simply for exchange of information, payments from Germany to the UK will suffer 20 per cent. withholding tax in Germany: the German Exchequer will keep that. However, payments from the UK to Germany will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0751">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
be paid gross, so the German tax authorities will also receive that tax revenue. Not only the City of London but the British Exchequer will suffer.<br><br>
I think that the Government realise that possibility and oppose it. However, we are unhappy about the fact that it could all have been made clearer so much sooner. I quoted earlier the damaging effect that is already being perceived. Swiss bankers are already witnessing, and have been for more than a year, unprecedented capital inflows into Switzerland. Their prevarication and drift and the fact that the Government have not made it clear beyond doubt that they will veto the directive, mean that damage is continuing. It is all being driven by complaints in Germany about tax evasion. We are all against tax evasion, but Germany has banking secrecy laws. That is the problem. If Germans are seriously concerned about preventing avoidance and evasion of tax in their own country, why do they not amend their secrecy laws? We do not have such laws. Even Jersey does not have them, beyond the common law requirements of banking confidentiality. The solution lies in Germany's own hands.<br><br>
I end by stressing the importance of the issue. There are 4,000 billion ecu of bonds in issue. Even if only 5 per cent. of them are held, that still amounts—if my maths is correct—to 200 billion ecu of bonds held in that way. The interest paid on that may, therefore, be liable for treatment under the directive. London is by far the dominant centre, not merely in Europe but in the world. Not all the 100,000 people who depend on the international securities market would lose their jobs if the directive were implemented, but thousands of them would.<br><br>
I find it extraordinary that, although the Government promised in an explanatory memorandum of 1997 a compliance cost assessment to calculate the precise figures, or, at least, to estimate the damage, no such assessment has been provided for this debate. I have not had to refer back to the documents; they are included in the bundle that has been provided. The document, dated 17 November 1997, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Compliance cost assessments will be undertaken on the taxation of savings and the elimination of interest and royalties between companies across borders if detailed proposals are put forward."</p></blockquote>
Detailed proposals have been put forward, and we need a compliance cost assessment. Such assessments are promised, and are common, whenever regulations are proposed that would have an effect on—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman does not intend to put an unfortunate spin on that. He knows full well that no proposals on the taxation of savings are on the table to be voted on. The obligation—which is quite right—to produce a compliance cost assessment relates to a final proposal on which we have been asked to vote. He is aware of that, having been a Minister for a very long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Lady to bundle seven, which contains a draft proposal—a draft directive. A proposal is being discussed next week, but the City has been denied an estimate of the job losses and damage that could be caused. I shall not lean
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
heavily on the matter, but there are many more problems in the package, and it is illustrative of the Government's approach to the matter. They deal in secrecy, will not take seriously the need to block the proposal at source early on, and have not made an underlying analysis of the damage that could be caused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman suggesting that, even before a shred of consensus has been reached among the Governments involved, every time that a proposal is made by anyone in the European Union the Government should prepare a detailed assessment? Is that consistent with his party's general stance on reducing Government expenditure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman heard what I said. When detailed proposals are presented to the public, the City of London or the House, the Government have an obligation to provide a compliance cost assessment in order to inform the debate, so that we can assess the possible damage against the claimed benefits. No such compliance cost assessment has been made. We are debating damage—indeed, the Minister herself accepts that the damage would be considerable. All that we are asking is that that should be slightly more scientifically assessed, in the usual way, through a compliance cost assessment. I realise that the hon. Member for Broxtowe is fairly new—I have been in the House for a few years now—but he will know that a compliance cost assessment is commonly made when regulations are introduced. These regulations would be especially damaging and important.<br><br>
Such omission is a comparatively minor offence. The main one is that the Government did not veto the proposal before it left the starting blocks. That would have reassured the markets and made our intention clear to the European Union, which is entitled to know where we stand on the matter. Instead, for years now, there has been delay and prevarication, and business has already been lost. At this very late stage, the Government should at least make it clear—perhaps the Minister will do so this afternoon—that they intend next week at ECOFIN to veto this damaging and destructive proposal.</span></p>
<p>5.54 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) made an interesting speech. The concept of vetoing nothing is new to me. I am sorry if I have stolen the Paymaster General's line, although I suspect that she agrees with me.<br><br>
My concern is that we receive the code of conduct working group report. That is important because it should inform debate in this country on European tax policy and its relation to the euro. I do not want to go beyond the Committee's remit—if I do, please call me to order, Mr. Gale—but the code of conduct working group was set up to ensure that the single market worked properly. I assumed that there was all-party support in this country for the notion that the single market should promote fair competition, without member states subsidising their industries through
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0752">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
direct or indirect payments, or state aid such as tax advantages. That was a sensible remit. I hope that the report clarifies the criteria of debate on tax harmonisation and which elements of taxation it would be inappropriate to harmonise across member states. The sooner that we have such a debate in this country, the better.<br><br>
Many people have fears about how fiscal policy might have to adapt in a single European currency, if this country were to join it. Those fears have been played on by various commentators and politicians, which has prevented a proper debate on the euro. The report of the working group should greatly contribute to clarity and reason in that important debate. When we seal the criteria and the musings of the different member states on the working group, we will see that there are many different ways of viewing different business taxes and their inter-relation.<br><br>
Sometimes, co-operation is necessary to ensure that trade is not hindered. Often, however, competition is more important to different tax regimes in a single market or currency area, as the right hon. Member for Wells and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said. When the Minister replies, I hope that she will share with the Committee some of her experiences and the lessons that she has drawn from the working group's debates. That should help her show the great scope for diversity of fiscal policy in a single market or currency.<br><br>
My studies of currency issues elsewhere—particularly in the United States, although the argument applies to unitary and federal states around the world—suggest that a single currency area is compatible with a wide variety of tax bases and rates for business. The Americans take great pride in their system: the economic strategy of different states is based on different tax rates and regimes, which is viewed as a strength.<br><br>
Several states in America have come together—it is similar to the working group in which the Minister has taken part—to co-ordinate and work together in some spheres.<br><br>
In the federal union that comprises the United States, there is huge room for diversity. Many American politicians view that as an inevitable consequence of a currency union. It is a necessity that makes the currency union work. Far from requiring fiscal and tax harmonisation, as many people would have us believe, such economic arrangements require a greater degree of fiscal independence. I hope that the Minister will agree that that is so, and that that would apply if this country entered the euro.</span></p>
<p>5.59 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, with his long experience and acute fiscal brain, developed during many years of work as an accountant, has more or less said it all. However, a few basic points remain.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Edward Davey) pointed out, the notion that company tax harmonisation is desirable in a single market is questionable, to say the least. The example of the United States of America, which he cited, is an extremely good one, especially as the United Kingdom has such a great advantage in its relatively low level of corporate taxation—an advantage that I hope that we shall rigorously retain. As my right hon. Friend so clearly explained, the pressure for fiscal harmonisation in the European Union is always upwards.<br><br>
It is good that the Paymaster General has set her face against the draft directive on savings, and even says that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor would, if necessary, exercise the veto—but only if the directive would inflict serious damage to British interests. What does she regard as serious damage? Anything that is in any way prejudicial to British interests should be unacceptable. She argued that the margins in the international bond market are extremely small; that the City of London's relative advantage comes from its high turnover; and that anything that eroded those margins may not appear at first sight to be extremely serious, but in the longer term could have a gravely prejudicial effect on the competitive position of the City's bond market. I hope that there is no ambiguity, weasel words, let-outs, sophistry, or casuistry in the use of the word "serious". The Government should not accept the possibility of any damage. Such damage would be wholly needless, because we could perfectly well veto the directive in advance by taking a principled stand, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells argues.<br><br>
Two other themes are central to this raft of documents. One great European of the post-war period, who had a significant impact on the development of the European Community—as it then was—was General de Gaulle. His reaction to the documents would have been, "A la poubelle"—into the waste paper basket. He would have regarded the prosperity and power of his country as the predominant interest. I wish that Her Majesty's Government would do the same.<br><br>
Whenever we address such fiscal issues adumbrated in draft directives from the European Union, we discover its hegemonistic ambitions at work. Those ambitions are usually advanced by secrecy and stealth—which is why my right hon. Friend was so right to criticise the fact that documentation that should be readily available to the Committee, the general public and the public in the Crown dependencies, was not. It was even suggested that it might be damaging for us to consider it because that might constitute a leak. I thought that open government was the basis of legitimacy in any democracy; secrecy in matters of taxation is certainly not.<br><br>
That is no way to advance changes in fiscal policy; they are best debated openly in national Parliaments. Otherwise, a sense of alienation will develop, and in time the European Union will become increasingly alienated from its constituent states and their peoples. We know what happened in the United States of America when we acted in that way over the taxation

of tea. Before too long, the reaction of the European peoples will make the Boston tea party look like a picnic—if that is not a mixed metaphor.</span></p>
<p>6.5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I explained in my opening remarks, ECOFIN decided in March 1998—as was published in the official record—that the group's discussions should be confidential as they proceed. The right hon. Member for Wells sought to accuse the Government of deliberately refusing to release documents and then continued to repeat the assertion that the Council handed out the reports to all and sundry who happened to request it, including Mr. Cowgill. I entirely agree that, if a decision is taken that a document is confidential, it should not be leaked while the discussion continues. We were bound by that decision.<br><br>
I was extremely unhappy—in fact, I was cross—that the document was leaked, by whom we know not, because it placed me in a difficult position vis-a-vis the United Kingdom Parliament. I am bound by ECOFIN's decision but, equally, I want to be fulsome in the information that I provide to the UK. The right hon. Member for Wells wants to force me to break my word, but I cannot do that simply because some scoundrel leaked the document. I have made it clear that we will press at ECOFIN for the document's publication, and I look forward to discussing many of the right hon. Gentleman's points. I have repeatedly said, and have been quietly confident throughout the process, that none of the UK measures, including the 100 per cent. capital allowances in Northern Ireland, will be found harmful. The changes that he referred to with regard to that measure resulted from the state-aid rules and were not connected to the code.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood was right to query the date that I gave for the treaty. I correct myself: it was 1958.<br><br>
Her Majesty's Opposition misunderstand and refuse to accept that there is no upward pressure for harmonisation on tax rates or direct tax bases. I shall return to why we should tackle harmful tax competition when I deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Wells said again that there was no compliance cost assessment, knowing full well that there is nothing for us to assess the compliance of yet. He can play with words for as long as he likes about drafts but, because he was a Treasury Minister, I know that he knows that lots of drafts appear as discussions progress in the European Union before the final draft that requires the vote. I am disappointed that he persists in implying that the Government have not done something. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton pointed out, "How do you veto nothing? How do you veto a discussion?" How can we stop our European partners discussing this issue? Do we gag them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no need for the Minister to take part in such discussions. It would save the British taxpayer a lot of money if she and her officials did not trot across to Brussels to take part in these nugatory
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
discussions. The cost to the taxpayer for all the Euro-meals of frites and waffles must be exorbitant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not like waffles. The hon. Gentleman suggests that the UK Government should not attend discussions and should refuse to go into a forum and actively argue for what they believe is in the best interest of the UK economy. That is breathtaking in its ostrich-like approach. Perhaps that sums up the Conservative party's approach to Europe,<br><br>
I am not a wilting violet; I like to put my point of view. When I do not agree with a point of view, I want to go out there and make sure that I advance the interests of the people whom I represent. I represent the UK Government, and I will engage vigorously in discussions with my European colleagues, putting forward what we believe are the best interests of the UK and, on the question of the draft directive on taxation of savings, the best thing for Europe, too.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton made a point with which I agree, as did the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. A single currency does not require single tax rates. That is the illusion of the debate about harmonised rates or bases. It is not the headline rate that counts and influences the location of business; it is the effective rate of taxation—and that is where we enter the debate about unfair tax competition. There can be a high-rate, narrow-based regime with lots of reliefs, so the effective rate that the company might pay is much lower. The UK system, by contrast, is low-rate, broad based, transparent and very outward looking and competitive. The Member for Kingston and Surbiton is quite right; single tax rates do not automatically follow a single currency.<br><br>
The code of conduct group has examined what constitutes unfair tax competition in existing member states. We went through a process. First, a list was produced. Secondly, descriptions were produced and the member state agreed the description of its tax measures with the Commission. The group then agreed all the descriptions, so that we knew what we were looking at. Then we went through the code. I cannot understand why people say that that it is not transparent.<br><br>
We started with paragraph B, which lays down five criteria to measure the description such as whether it lacks transparency, contravenes the OECD rules or is ring-fenced only for non-residents. We then moved on to ask whether the description offered a significantly lower effective rate of taxation than the level in that member state. We considered the measure with regard not to all member states, but to a particular member state's tax base. It was not a question of the UK having one rate and France another.<br><br>
We than examined regional development issues. Paragraph G requires us to state whether the measure was proportioned and targeted, and therefore did not affect the location of business. Finally, we had to test all the criteria to find out whether they affected the location of business by offering a significantly lower effective taxation rate.<br><br>
That is a straightforward, transparent, informative process. We said that we were examining potentially harmful measures and would not publish such a list.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0754">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
Surely, the possible damage to a member state is obvious, were something to appear and then be adjudicated as not harmful.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said that we should get rid of the savings directive. However, he used the very tactic in the draft directive that he deprecates, saying that we should put equal pressure on every member state to examine the list. That is not a sensible way in which to conduct negotiations.<br><br>
The group has now—just about—completed its assessment, and its report will go to ECOFIN. I hope that ECOFIN will agree to publish that report, as it will inform a lot of people about the relevant issues in the European Union. Those issues are not tax harmonisation, tax-base harmonisation or some grand plan for a fortress Europe, but relate to a positive, engaging debate about highly competitive economies creating growth, jobs and security in individual member states. They also involve how we lock together as a European Union, making sure that Europe is competitive, outward-looking and engaging in the global economy. How do we take advantage of e-commerce and ensure that we capitalise on the potential?<br><br>
That is the subject of the discussions in which the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood thinks we should not participate. He believes that that is how the best interests of businesses are represented. The Government do not agree.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood also made several points about overseas and dependent territories. Of course, much is happening. However, some tax measures in some of those territories provide for zero taxation and exemptions from tax. The hon. Gentleman went on about a level playing field.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never used that phrase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw that; the hon. Gentleman used many interesting phrases about waffles, but he did not refer to a level playing field. He is obviously not a sporty type. However, in the context of providing a level playing field for British business, it would be difficult to defend zero taxation. There must be some consistency.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the Government's views, of which there are too many to read out. However, on 17 April, the Chancellor said in a press statement:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have always said we would always do everything to advance the eurobond market in the United Kingdom and that we will not agree to any directive that imposes a withholding tax on Britain.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
What is interesting in the last few weeks is that there is a growing understanding of the British position—that we are both determined and right in what we are doing."</p></blockquote>
Our European partners are actively engaging with us in that debate, which is the best way to advance interests as part of the European Union.<br><br>
The Government are determined to stand firm. As I said on the draft directive on the taxation of savings and on harmful tax competition, we fully support the interest and royalties directive. However, we do not accept the taxation of savings directive in its present form. I trust that Committee members agree with the Government and the City of London that the proposals in the UK paper on international bonds are needed to protect the international bond market, and will see their way clear to supporting the motion. I also trust that the Committee will join the Government in welcoming the Commission's efforts to develop further the single market in financial services, with all the benefits that it will clearly bring to the City of London.</span></p>
