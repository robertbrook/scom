Common Strategy on Ukraine</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>[<i>Relevant Documents: European Union Document No. 13523/2/99, the Common Strategy on Ukraine, and the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum dated 31 January 2000 from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on the Presidency's work plan on the implementation of the Common Strategy of the European Union on Ukraine</i>]</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Keith Vaz)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Malins?<br><br>
I want to apologise for the fact that the final version of the common strategy did not appear in the pack of papers that was sent to members of the Committee last week. In the interests of providing the Committee with as much information as possible and wanting to give hon. Members as much time as possible to look at the papers, my officials advertently placed a near-final version of the strategy in the pack. I assure members of the Committee that the text of the two documents—the final version and the near-final version—is essentially the same. I understand that hon. Members were sent the correct version today.<br><br>
I should like to say something about Ukraine and the Government's policy towards it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that there can be no interventions during the opening statement. There will be plenty of opportunity for them later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Malins. It is some time since I have served on a Committee of this nature and I had forgotten the form of proceedings.<br><br>
Obviously, in the generosity of our hearts we would want to forgive the Minister and the Foreign Office for inadvertently supplying papers as late as 24 hours before the Committee was due to sit, but could you advise me, Mr. Malins, on whether it would be proper to proceed with our sitting, given that we have had only 24 hours to scrutinise those papers? Indeed, in my case they arrived from the Vote Office only this morning in the internal post. Is it usual to proceed when papers have been delivered to Members so late? I am sad to say that it has happened many times before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will have noticed that the Minister expressed his apologies. It is not unusual in this place for papers to arrive quite late. The hon. Lady will not be alone in having begun to read them only at 9 o'clock sharp this morning. In my view, it is proper for this debate to proceed on the basis that the papers arrived
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
just sufficiently beforehand. However, the Minister will have noted the hon. Lady's comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have indeed noted them and I repeat my apology. We will endeavour to ensure that it does not happen again.<br><br>
Ukraine's achievements since regaining its independence are considerable and the United Kingdom applauds them. In less than nine years, Ukraine has consolidated its role as an independent sovereign state with a functioning democracy. Ethnic and linguistic divisions within the country have been well managed and present no serious threat to the nation's stability.<br><br>
Ukraine has pursued a remarkably balanced foreign policy—especially so, given her history. She has established significant strategic relationships with NATO, the European Union and the United States and maintains a close and stable relationship with Russia. Ukraine has sought to play a constructive role in seeking solutions to regional conflicts and has played a responsible role within the United Nations, successfully achieving a place on the Security Council for two years from 1 January this year, providing the President in 1997–98 and contributing troops to peacekeeping operations, including in the Balkans. Ukraine has relinquished its nuclear weapons status—a historic decision for which Ukraine deserves our gratitude and thanks.<br><br>
However, the achievements of recent years will not in themselves bring prosperity and economic growth to Ukraine. The latter can be achieved only by thorough administrative and economic reform, which will promote domestic entrepreneurship and attract foreign direct investment.<br><br>
The progress of reform depends on the ability of the current pro-reform Government of President Kuchma and Prime Minister Yushchenko to put into practice policies of the type that they have publicly advocated. At the moment, Ukraine finds itself at a critical stage in its economic development. The International Monetary Fund's $2.6 billion extended finance facility for Ukraine is currently suspended. At the same time, Ukraine is at a sensitive stage in the renegotiation of its crippling foreign debt burden. At this critical moment, a parliamentary crisis and a proposed referendum on constitutional change threaten to undermine the cause of reform by tying up Government and Parliament in political knots.<br><br>
The United Kingdom's objective is to be a recognised and valued partner of Ukraine in a common effort to integrate Ukraine into the community of nations sharing western values. A close bilateral relationship enables us to contribute to the general western objective of supporting Ukraine's transition into a free-market democracy which respects the human rights of its citizens. It positions us well to support current and future United Kingdom interests, including economic ones.<br><br>
In our contact with the Ukrainian authorities, we aim to promote and support economic reform as a way to encourage economic growth and keep Ukraine internally stable. We encourage political reform, and respect for and belief in democracy.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0760">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
In foreign policy we aim to encourage Ukraine to share our views on a range of international issues. That includes working with Ukraine to make a success of its United Nations Security Council membership. In pursuing this dialogue, the Foreign Secretary had three substantive meetings with Foreign Minister Tarasyuk last year and intends to visit Kiev soon. I also aim to go to Ukraine later in the year, if possible.<br><br>
Even before the adoption of the common strategy, Ukraine was already established as one of the European Union's key partners. Ukraine is important because of its size, its geographical proximity to the European Union—it borders on four applicant countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania—and its bearing on European stability and security. It is clearly in the European Union's interests to promote democracy and a sound economy in Ukraine, to engage on issues such as the environment, energy and nuclear safety, and to strengthen co-operation on trade, justice and home affairs.<br><br>
The partnership and co-operation agreement, now in force for almost two years, is the basis of that relationship. Its wide range testifies to the breadth of our partnership. It covers nearly all fields of co-operation, from trade and economic reform to political dialogue and technical assistance.<br><br>
The European Union's commitment to helping Ukraine is not just a question of fine words. The Community alone has given more than 600 million euros of assistance through the TACIS programme since 1991, not to mention the bilateral arrangements of individual EU countries. The United Kingdom's technical assistance programme, the know-how fund, provides £9 million of assistance a year. It is the third largest national programme after those of the United States and Germany. TACIS has supported a wide range of projects, from the development of tourism to the modernisation of agriculture.<br><br>
From the outset, the United Kingdom perceived the common strategy as a valuable opportunity to define more clearly our objectives for the European Union-Ukraine relationship. We wanted to look to the future and set out a vision of a closer relationship between the EU and Ukraine, and define practical actions to help us realise that vision. One of the common strategy's strengths is the fact that it clearly expresses the European Union's objectives for the EU-Ukraine relationship in the short and medium term. We are satisfied that those objectives closely resemble and complement our bilateral objectives.<br><br>
I am grateful to the European Scrutiny Committee for its reports on the common strategy and the presidency's work plan. Some preliminary remarks on the specific aspects about which the Committee expressed interest may be helpful. The European Scrutiny Committee suggests that there is a contrast between the
<br><blockquote><p>"optimistic tone of the Common Strategy and the events reported by the Council of Europe delegation"</p></blockquote>
that monitored the 1999 presidential elections. I do not share that view.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The first of the European Union's strategic goals, as specified in paragraph 5 of the common strategy, is
<br><blockquote><p>"to contribute to the emergence of a stable, open and pluralistic democracy".</p></blockquote>
Such language clearly recognises that Ukraine has not yet attained a level of democracy appropriate for a member of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe. The EU was quick to point out that the conduct of the 1999 presidential election campaign fell short of OSCE standards. Although the EU also agreed with the OSCE that voting and the counting of votes were conducted properly, and that the legitimacy of the election result was not in doubt, the common strategy is not intended to gloss over the campaign's shortcomings, which include bias in the state media and inappropriate pressure on voters by state employees. Indeed, paragraph 12 urges Ukraine to heed the criticisms of the OSCE monitoring mission following the presidential elections.<br><br>
Paragraph 12 also urges Ukraine to fulfil the commitments to reform made when joining the Council of Europe in 1995. At this stage, the Government categorically do not believe that the death penalty in Ukraine has been secretly reinstated or that political prisoners have been executed. We believe that the moratorium on executions has been respected since its introduction in 1997. Furthermore, abolition of the death penalty—one of the main obligations that Ukraine owed the Council of Europe—has effectively been achieved by dint of the constitutional court's ruling in December that the death penalty was unconstitutional.<br><br>
I have said that Ukraine has a working democracy. I did not mean to imply that it had a perfect democracy, and I am satisfied that the common strategy makes that clear.<br><br>
The European Scrutiny Committee report suggests that the presidency's work plan may be over-ambitious. It is certainly wide ranging, which I strongly welcome, but whether it proves to be over-ambitious will be discovered only when we take stock of progress at the end of the Portuguese presidency in June.<br><br>
The European Scrutiny Committee's reports make several other interesting points with which I am sure that we shall be able to deal in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new regulations to form the legal basis of most of the EU technical assistance to the newly independent states and Mongolia were adopted on 29 December 1999. Country allocations have not been agreed, but I understand that the Ukraine's share of the provisional sum is 5,000 million euros, which would suggest that the Ukraine in-country programme would receive about 575 million euros. How do the Government envisage that that will be spent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be spent in co-operation with the Ukraine Government. In adopting a common strategy, it is important that we work through the institutions in Ukraine. The technical assistance provided by TACIS will enable our programme's aims to be achieved. One cannot examine one programme in isolation. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0761">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
technical support that we give through TACIS and the way in which money is spent should be in line with our overall strategy of preparing Ukraine for its place in Europe. It is an extremely important country and needs to be encouraged to see itself as European through the partnership and co-operation agreement and the common strategy. We hope that TACIS, the know-how fund and bilateral agreements between countries will be part of that overall theme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he certainly believed that there had been no executions since 1997. Will he comment more generally on the observance of human rights conventions in Ukraine?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We very much hope that the principles of human rights conventions are being observed. We have no information other than that which we have received and about which I have told Committee members. We strongly believe that the death penalty has not been carried out since 1997. The court's decision to declare it unconstitutional is extremely important.<br><br>
Given the problems thrown up during the monitoring of the election campaign, Ukraine is under no misapprehension about our desire to ensure that human rights are observed and citizens' rights respected. However, if there are any problems involving human rights, we intend to raise them at the earliest opportunity. The issue must be examined and cannot be put to one side. Since 1991, Ukraine has done well in establishing a pluralistic approach to democracy. However, when faults occur, we must raise them. Our economic interests should not be secondary to the well-being and welfare of the citizens of Ukraine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The failure thus far to dismantle and decommission the Chernobyl nuclear power station is a serious cause for concern arising from the documents. Will my hon. Friend comment on that and the apparent plans to develop further nuclear power plants in Ukraine instead of using alternative approaches to future energy supplies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to say that that is an important issue, He will know that decommissioning Chernobyl and ensuring nuclear safety will cost a huge amount. Indeed, it is estimated that that will cost $758 million. Of couse, the Group of Seven has provided support, but Ukraine itself must ensure that the matter is dealt with.<br><br>
It is estimated that complete decommissioning will take 50 to 70 years, which is a considerable period. A donor conference—a pledging conference—is due to be held in May. We hope that further attempts will be made to help raise funds. However, the matter must be examined because of the history and emotional nature of the word "Chernobyl". However, the Ukrainians are under no misapprehension about the fact that we need to encourage them to decommission and provide better nuclear safety.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister satisfied with the proposal to give a large sum to Ukraine under the TACIS programme? Is he sure that it will be well spent? Has he had a chance to consider whether that money should go to Ukraine, especially given its political situation, which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
is far from stable? I am sure that the Minister has seen the reports in today's <i>Financial Times</i> of the fights that have broken out in the Ukrainian Parliament in the past 24 hours—in one of which a leading journalist in that country comments:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is obvious that no one really knows what to do next. Politics here is very spontaneous."</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister think that the current prospect of millions of euros flowing to Ukraine from the TACIS programme is foolhardy or sensible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not had an opportunity to read the <i>Financial Times</i> this morning, so I cannot comment on it. Like the hon. Lady, I was busily reading the final version of the papers, which my office failed to deliver. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) for letting me have a copy.<br><br>
Clearly, interesting things are happening in the Ukrainian Parliament. However, we are satisfied that Ukraine remains a stable democracy, notwithstanding the physical contact between its Members of Parliament. I assure the hon. Lady that we do of course want to ensure that any money spent by the European Union or this country on any other country is monitored very carefully. Not a penny of the money will be spent unless we know that doing so will be of value. If the hon. Lady has any evidence to suggest otherwise, we should be keen to look at it. We will not simply throw money at problems and hope that they will go away. Of course the way in which funds are spent must be monitored properly. The rules governing such matters will be adhered to strictly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jane Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Reading, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that Ukraine was chosen for the second common strategy implies that the EU places an extremely high priority on Ukraine and its development, yet it is much further from EU membership than other former Soviet republics, especially the Baltic states. Will the Minister comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, and I am glad that Ukraine has been chosen for the second strategy. She is also right that it will be a considerable time before Ukraine regards itself as being ready to be a candidate for EU membership. It is the second largest country in Europe and has a population of 49 million people, so it is extremely important strategically. As my hon. Friend knows, at Helsinki, we in the EU gave the go-ahead for further applicants to be considered for membership of the EU. Four of the countries in the first and second waves border Ukraine, so we have to deal with the matter; it not simply go away. We must ensure that we have a common strategy to deal with the difficulties that Ukraine faces.<br><br>
I do not envisage Ukraine being ready for candidacy status for a considerable time. Much work must be done before it is anywhere near reaching that stage, but that does not mean that we should not work with Ukraine through the common strategy, the partnership and co-operation agreements and its developing relationship with NATO to ensure that it remains stable. The problems of eastern Europe cannot be shoved away; we must be aware of them and deal with them.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0762">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is reported that President Kuchma will hold a referendum in April, which may result in the Parliament's powers being reduced in favour of more power for the presidency. What evaluation has the Minister made of that proposal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We note that a referendum will be held. The Government's argument is that some elements are not helping to promote the reform programme. In view of Ukraine's history, we need to consider carefully both the purpose of the referendum and how it is conducted. Removing the powers of Parliament is not the best way to secure a stable democracy. That is why we need to examine the terms of the referendum so carefully. Obviously, the Government believe that certain elements have tried to hinder President Kuchma's reform package. It remains to be seen whether yesterday's events in Parliament throw light on the issue. We shall certainly examine it most carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the criticisms advanced by the Council of Europe observer of the presidential elections was about biased media reporting in support of one candidate. That criticism is a common feature of several former eastern bloc countries. What practical assistance can the Foreign Office or the European Union provide? There is a danger of a constant stream of OSCE delegations pointing out the problem, but nothing ever being done about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that contribution, as the issue affects several former Soviet countries. It is important to have a flourishing and independent media, which is why the common strategy talks about bilateral contacts. So much can be gained by contacts between Ministers and between parliamentarians. We must try to help with encouraging an independent and flourishing media, which should also be a responsible media. We can help by developing formal and informal contracts. We want people to feel confident that any future election or referendum will be conducted fairly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I warmly endorse the Minister's statement and the motion on the Order Paper about a common strategy for Ukraine. As he said, its future as a stable and prosperous nation is crucial to the stability of Europe as a whole. Does the Minister view what happened to the virtually Soviet regime of Belarus under Lukaschenko as a dire warning and awesome precedent that must be avoided by Ukraine? Following the suggestion by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), can the Minister do more to strengthen our parliamentary ties with the Rada? At the Council of Europe meeting last week, the deputies from Ukraine emphasised the grave crisis that they face. As the Minister observed, it will be very difficult to resolve it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to raise these issues and I am well aware of his interest in them. He is right to remind us to be vigilant in promoting and protecting the democracies of the former Soviet Union, because democracy is so precious. We must not take our eyes off the potentially dangerous situation that could develop if things go wrong.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman should know that we in the Foreign Office regard eastern Europe as an important
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
area. Sometimes the Minister for Europe may seem to focus only on EU countries. Of course our partners are important, but the Government believe that we should be constantly vigilant regarding eastern Europe. My first visit as a Minister was to Hungary and Poland. The Foreign Secretary, myself and other Ministers will continue to visit eastern Europe. We are regarded with enormous respect and the east Europeans want to do business with our companies and to deal with us as a Government. One way of ensuring that those countries remain on the path of democracy is to keep those contacts going.<br><br>
It is for Parliament to decide how to improve links between our two Parliaments. It is important to have a bilateral visit. As none has taken place so far, I am open to the suggestion that we take a group of parliamentarians with us, so that the links between our country and the Parliament in Ukraine can be developed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jenny Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister will be aware that the Council of Europe and OSCE reports on the parliamentary election last year pointed out that democratic and economic reform was extremely slow because of the political deadlock between the President and the Parliament, which does not seem to have improved since the election. Is my hon. Friend satisfied that the President and the Parliament have the will to take full advantage of the common strategy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am, on the basis of the evidence that I have; but as one of the observers, my hon. Friend could probably tell the Committee more than I can. I have not yet visited Ukraine. There is a willingness to ensure that the common strategy succeeds. My hon. Friend's experience may give her an impression about what we can do to make things better. The way to deal with these situations is not necessarily to condemn, as people become isolated and countries feel that no one wants to deal with them. The approach that we should adopt, based on my hon. Friend's experience, is to ensure that we embellish those contacts and try to encourage the existing stable democracy to flourish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last thing that I would wish to see is the further isolation of the Ukraine. It is good to hear the Minister being so encouraging, but some questions must be answered. One was raised on 7 December 1999 in questions about Angola when the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) admitted that he was aware of Ukrainian pilots flying in supplies to prolong the war in Angola. One of Ukraine's success stories is the export of its weaponry. It is the 10th largest weapons exporter in the world. What steps has the Minister taken to follow up on his colleague's view, expressed in <i>Hansard</i> at column 682, that the Ukrainian pilots' activity "must be stopped"? He looked to the Ukrainian Government to take immediate action to stop it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The follow-up found no evidence of any involvement by the Ukrainian Government although the plane may well have had Ukrainian pilots, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State said. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Lady.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Eileen Gordon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Romford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The common strategy will make it clear that the main responsibility for Ukrainian development lies with the Ukrainians. Does my hon. Friend endorse that view, and is it realistic?.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do endorse that, but there must be good will on both sides. The Government of the Ukraine need to take responsibility for making progress. We, as members of the EU and bilaterally, will always do what we can to help but, in the end, countries will only move with consent. Although we can work with them and encourage them to improve and to make progress, in the end it is very much up to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me continue my line of questioning. The Ukraine is a major supplier to Pakistan. It recently won the contract for the delivery of 300-odd tanks to Pakistan. Given the tension in that region, does that sale worry the Minister?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady obviously wants to take me on a Cook's tour of the world. We have had Angola and now we have Pakistan. Our position on Pakistan is clear. We should like to see it returned to democracy as soon as possible. I know of no evidence of any support by Ukraine for any subversive elements in Pakistan and I do not believe that it is my place to comment on that. The Government's position on the Ukraine is clear, and on Pakistan we are very clear: we want it to return to democracy as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly said that Chernobyl is one of the biggest challenges that Ukraine faces. I was struck by a recent meeting with the Chernobyl, children's support group in my constituency. Its members told me that taking children out of Chernobyl with the support of British families can significantly increase life expectancy. Should not the Government support British families in providing that help, not only as a worthwhile end in itself, but as a means of ensuring that the Ukrainian Government focus on decommissioning at the earliest opportunity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend: it is extremely important that we maintain those links. Chernobyl had a huge emotional impact on our generation and is politically and historically very important. We must try to help Ukraine recover from that scar, and anything that helps in that regard should be encouraged.<br><br>
To clarify an earlier point, when I said that decommissioning would cost $758 million, I was referring to the cost merely of repairing the concrete shell covering the reactor that melted down in 1986; the actual cost of decommissioning is estimated to be several billion dollars and the process will take between 50 and 75 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about the economic problems confronting Ukraine. Is it not the case that the reform process there has been labelled "crony capitalism"? Does he believe that the United Kingdom could do more to encourage Ukraine's technical development by means of active co-operation agreements in, for example, the space and aeronautics industry, especially as President Leonid Kuchma is a former rocket engineer? Moreover, the Antonov facility
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
produces perhaps the biggest and best heavy lift transport aircraft in the world, which could be of interest to the Royal Air Force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's interest in the RAF, as Northolt is in his constituency.<br><br>
It is important that this country's business community understands the potential for business and trade in Ukraine. In my visits to eastern European countries, I found that the Germans and the Americans—friends and allies of ours, of course—have businesses out there and ensure that they are making the necessary contacts. It is important that we encourage our business community to be fully involved. The Government will, through our embassy, give every assistance possible, in connection with the space and aeronautics industry or other sectors. Our business people and the private sector should be out there and fully involved. If we are not, others will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Clark <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to take my hon. Friend back to the issue of Chernobyl and the wider nuclear industry. I listened carefully to his response to our hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North. He said that we must encourage the Ukrainian Government to create a safe nuclear industry.<br><br>
I have no doubt that many people, in the House and elsewhere would agree that we should not take over or direct the development of economic strategies and so on; that must come from within the states themselves. However, the nuclear industry issue goes far wider, as we saw in 1986. Does my hon. Friend consider that encouragement is enough? Should more help and support be provided to ensure that the nuclear industry is safe for us all?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We should not merely encourage; we should do something practical to help. Through the G7, the United Kingdom has done that, and we will continue to do so. We supported the establishment of a donor conference in May because it was another way of helping. We cannot expect the Ukrainian Government to do it alone. They are obviously primarily responsible because Chernobyl is on their patch, but we must try to help them pay for it. The European Union has been able to assist through TACIS and other programmes, and it will continue to do so.<br><br>
However, we must also realise that the technical help that we can offer is sometimes more important than money. Such aid will obviously be expensive, and if it is given, other things will not be done, but it may be more important than anything else that we can do. We shall continue to give that support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The British Council has done some sterling work in Ukraine from its new centre in Kiev. It now operates in five cities—perhaps the Minister would confirm the extent of the operation. It is a success story. The British Council is one of our great diplomatic weapons in encouraging countries to move towards what we would consider to be full-blown democracy.<br><br>
Ukraine has achieved some importance as a result of the suggested common strategy. Will the Minister therefore assure the Committee that the money given to the British Council for its activities in Ukraine will be protected and ring-fenced?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0764">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Lady that we join her in praising the work of the British Council. As a former vice-chairman of the council, I know that it does some excellent work there, including advising Ukrainians about opportunities to study in the United Kingdom. It gives a great deal of help and support.<br><br>
The Government cannot tell the British Council what to do. The council has a formidable chairperson in Baroness Kennedy, and I am sure that she is fully aware of the importance of the work being done in Ukraine. I am happy to write to Baroness Kennedy to reiterate the points made by the hon. Lady, and I am sure that the council will continue to play a part in keeping those links open.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 13523/2/99, the Common Strategy on Ukraine, and the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum dated 31 January 2000 from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on the Presidency's work plan on the implementation of the Common Strategy of the European Union on Ukraine; supports the Government's objective of developing closer, construction relations with Ukraine; and agrees that the Common Strategy has the potential to make a significant contribution towards strengthening the EU-Ukraine relationship.—[<i>Mr. Vaz.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>11.13 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What a pleasure it is to see such unanimity of purpose. We are united in our desire to see progress on all fronts in Ukraine and we look forward to an improvement in our already good relations with that country. The importance of Ukraine as a partner nation to the European Union and as a neighbour is appreciated and wholly to be welcomed.<br><br>
Since Ukraine regained its independence in 1991, it has faced enormous tasks. One should remember the legacy that has confronted the country. The awful experience of enforced collectivisation at the hands of the Soviets cost several million lives. The country was invaded by Hitler's armies in 1941 and it suffered the aftermath of the second world war. The struggle of the Ukrainian People's Army in the Carpathians continued until the mid-1950s. Independence was a dearly held aspiration and it seemed difficult of realisation, but it has occurred and it must now be sustained by the free, democratic countries of western Europe. I regard the common strategy as evidence of Europe's determination to sustain it.<br><br>
Ukraine has immense potential as a partner with western Europe. If the agricultural sector could be properly reformed, it would offer extremely cheap food for western Europe, which would in itself pose a challenge to western Europe. It will be interesting to see how the common economic area with the European Union will work out. Similarly, Ukraine's heavy industry is another potential partner for western Europe, although it needs to be reformed drastically. Much of it will have to be closed down and a great deal of investment will have to be made in appropriate sectors. Ukraine has been dependent for so long on its relationship with its bigger neighbour to the north; that relationship is crucial, but most of us recognise the importance of a strong, independent stable Ukraine, not least as a counterweight to Russia in such unpredictable times. I regard the common strategy and the attitude of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
the Foreign Office to be laudable and I wholeheartedly support it.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree in the main with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), although there are some differences between us. It is remarkable, given how it suffered during the 20th century, that Ukraine is still a coherent country that maintains good relations with its neighbours and has preserved its own culture and identity through such difficult times. That must be admired.<br><br>
Clearly, there are serious economic and political problems. Today's <i>Financial Times</i> contains a photograph of deputies fighting. We have arguments in the House of Commons, but we do not go that far. There are tensions within the politics of Ukraine and I hope that we can use what skills western Europe has to create a much more stable democracy. Corruption poisons so many countries throughout the world and, according to <i>The Independent</i> of 21 January, Ukraine is joint 21st in the league table of the world's most corrupt nations. I am not sure how that is measured, but many former eastern European republics are on that list. Corruption is often associated with economic decline, poverty and declining resources, so it is important to overcome corruption by helping economic development.<br><br>
We are familiar with the rather unedifying spectacle of a former president, who now lives outside the country, accusing the present Ukraine Government of corruption while he is under the threat of extradition for his own corruption and misuse of International Monetary Fund money. In some countries of the former Soviet Union, including Russia, there has been laundering of money from the west back into banks in New York, for example. As we know, until recently, such laundering has been connected to the leadership of Russia. We cannot be absolutely certain about that connection and I do not want to make accusations if they are not backed up with evidence, but there is strong suspicion that a lot of money that is intended to help development and the people finds its way into the pockets of certain individuals. We want to overcome that problem.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will try to exercise what leverage the EU has to ensure that assistance goes to genuine economic development, the people and the economies of Ukraine and that it does not find its way into the foreign bank accounts of politicians, as IMF funds have apparently done. That must be avoided at all costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is important that the Government should not just roll along with the proposals under TACIS and allow vast sums of money to be made available to Ukraine without ensuring that there is a significant improvement in the monitoring and audit of the use of those funds?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. That is the thrust of my remarks. The British Government should use their good offices to ensure that EU moneys are properly applied, with the emphasis on technical assistance rather than just handing over money as one possible way forward.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0765">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Another concern is economic reform and the speed with which privatisations take place, the insistence on over-rigid monetary policies, and so on. In the short term, that can have seriously damaging effects on economic activity. In some countries, notably Russia, it has caused a serious decline in national output, and it would not be an appropriate way forward. It tends to promote political instability and, indeed, corruption. We have seen some instability in Russia which I believe derives largely from its economic policy and its attempt to go for the brutal cold shower approach to economic reform rather than adopting a more pragmatic approach with a gradual transition to make the best of what economic activity it has in the short and medium term.<br><br>
We have witnessed not merely low growth, but a negative growth, falling living standards and terrible privations suffered by the ordinary people in some of those countries. We have also seen that business, rather than being set in our own context of law and regulation, has become almost synonymous with criminality. Rapid privatisation has forced things into private hands without providing a good legal basis for business and a stable, trustworthy banking system. All those things are important if one is to have economic reform and adjustment to a more mixed economy or the western European style.<br><br>
If Ukraine went for that type of rapid transformation, closing down some of the less efficient industries of the Soviet past, there would be no fairy godmother to reinvest immediately as there was for East Germany. East Germany went through that rapid transformation, but it had the richest, most powerful country in western Europe, namely West Germany, prepared to recycle vast amounts of money into that quarter of the historic Germany to overcome the problem. Even so, there is still a degree of poverty and unemployment in East Germany that even West German wealth has not yet overcome. I caution the EU, and indeed the IMF, about forcing too rapid a rate of economic reform in Ukraine.<br><br>
On the issue of energy policy, we have discussed our concerns about Chernobyl. The papers mention grossly inefficient use of energy in general, and the possibility of developing further nuclear power stations. I am not familiar with Ukrainian energy policy in detail, but it strikes me that current energy usage is very inefficient. If emphasis were to be laid on making much more efficient use of existing energy supplies and using natural gas, to which there is access, the development of further nuclear power might be avoided in that country. I hope that the EU will consider that.<br><br>
Finally, I was struck by the comment of the Select Committee, which reflected my own feelings on reading the papers, that the common strategy has a rather optimistic tone; it is almost bland, anodyne, when contrasted with the problems of Ukraine. I hope that that does not reflect a glossing over of realities, but represents a political stance, deliberately adopted so that the European Union does not become too alarmed about the situation in Ukraine and tries instead to help out of optimism.<br><br>
There are deep economic and political problems in Ukraine, in spite of which it seems to have good relations with the EU and its neighbours. I hope that that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
continues, and that the EU has a realistic understanding and appreciation of Ukraine's problems. We should not take at face value the rather bland and optimistic tone of the common strategy document. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to those points.</span></p>
<p>11.25 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jenny Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Minister rightly said, I was fortunate enough to be in Ukraine in October to observe the presidential elections on behalf of the Council of Europe. I should make it clear from the outset that democratic and economic reform is necessary in Ukraine, and the country needs help to achieve it. The reports of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe should not be misinterpreted as expressing a desire to isolate Ukraine. We were given a job of work to do and were obliged to report what we found. Although the reports were fairly critical about the democratic process, that does not necessarily mean that we did not agree that Ukraine needed help to speed up its reform.<br><br>
There may be good geopolitical and strategic reasons why Ukraine should be brought closer to Europe and the European Union, but the most overwhelming reason for helping Ukraine is to help its people. We tried to speak to as many Ukrainians as we could on polling day and the days surrounding it, and there was no doubt that they had enormous enthusiasm for democracy. They do not want to return to the bad old days, but the economy is not in a good state for many of them. Ukrainians are hard pressed and some live in considerable poverty. They might be in danger of becoming disillusioned with the slowness of the economic reforms.<br><br>
In the second round of the presidential elections, Kuchma was up against a man called Symenyenko, who was a communist. His election platform was that turning towards Europe and embracing western democracy no longer worked, and that Ukraine should therefore seriously consider realigning itself with what was left of surrounding countries from the former Soviet Union. We all know the dangers of that and share the common view that helping Ukraine look more towards the EU is wise for all concerned. It is probably the best option for the Ukrainian people.<br><br>
There is a question about the political will of the president and Parliament to bring about the necessary democratic reforms. I have not seen today's <i>Financial Times,</i> but I am not surprised about what it said and I smiled to myself when it was mentioned. A political deadlock is paralysing economic and democratic reform. We questioned the political will when we became aware of the many accusations of media bias during the campaign. The Ukrainian democratic process has a mechanism to deal with such complaints, in the form of a commission to oversee television and radio. When we asked why it did not work, we found that the commission was inquorate because the president, Leonid Kuchma, had not nominated four of his representatives. Despite the fact that the elections would take place and that there would probably be complaints, the commission was effectively prevented from working.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0766">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
I shall address Ukraine's adherence to the European convention on human rights and its obligations as a member of the Council of Europe, especially in relation to the death penalty.<br><br>
A country joining the Council of Europe parliamentary assembly is required to declare a moratorium if it still has the death penalty. It is usually given about three years in which to pass legislation to abolish that penalty. Ukraine joined the Council of Europe in 1995. In 1997, human rights groups in Ukraine were made aware that the moratorium was no longer holding and the death penalty was being used. The Council of Europe sent a rapporteur and back-up to Ukraine to find out what was going on. On her return, the rapporteur reported that the death penalty was being used, that people were being executed and that there was doubt about exactly what crimes they had committed—hence the question about political prisoners being executed.<br><br>
The rapporteur's report was debated in a full parliamentary assembly. None of the Ukrainian parliamentarians denied what was going on, so their credentials were challenged and they were submitted to a year's monitoring. They have now been monitored for just over a year. As the Minister said, the Ukraine supreme court declared the death penalty unconstitutional in December 1999. Hopefully, therefore, it has gone and that matter is out of the way. However, the Council of Europe knew what was going on in Ukraine and took action.<br><br>
Finally, I welcome the Minister's proposal on visiting Ukraine. I enjoyed my time there, despite the considerable hardship. In many ways, the position is grim. Ukraine has enormous potential. Some Ukrainians have hard lives, but they are an innovative, enthusiastic people. They deserve a better future than that which their politicians are giving them.<br><br>
Broadly speaking, I welcome the common strategy. However, we must be realistic about Ukraine's problems. Reform will not be easy and the work programme proposed by the EU is rather ambitious.</span></p>
<p>11.32 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Eileen Gordon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Romford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to spend a few minutes speaking about Chernobyl. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) mentioned Chernobyl in the context of nuclear energy and nuclear power stations. However, I want to talk about the consequences of the world's worst nuclear accident, which occurred in 1986 and has an impact on the Ukraine's economy and future.<br><br>
I have close links with Chernobyl Children Lifeline, which is run by one of my constituents, Valerie Howard. She does some fantastic work, helping to bring groups of children to spend a month in the UK. The group builds up their health with non-contaminated food and so on, and takes them out and about. Usually, the children arrive with hardly anything and are provided with clothes and goods and live with local families.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Many of the children are from Belarus, which was drastically affected by the Chernobyl accident. However, in Ukraine, some 2 million people live in radioactive zones. The statistics are frightening, as are the health consequences. For instance, 800,000 children in the Chernobyl region have a high risk of developing cancer and leukaemia. Moreover, 170,000 children under the age of seven in that area have received radiation doses high enough to cause thyroid cancer. It is estimated that only 5 per cent. of children there are healthy.<br><br>
In certain areas, high levels of radioactivity have resulted in a ban preventing children from walking in forests and the rain, playing in parks and picking wild berries and flowers. In those zones, parents check radiation levels in their newspapers every morning to decide whether it is safe to allow their children to go to school.<br><br>
The health consequences and the impact of radiation on Ukraine will be enormous. Has that been considered? Has Ukraine implemented health care strategies, especially for children, who are its future?</span></p>
<p>11.35 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good question time and a wide-ranging debate. I hope that the Minister has been listening carefully, because, although a great commonality of purpose is evident on both sides of the Committee, warning flags are being ran up the flagpole, and the Minister must respond.<br><br>
I am not entirely sure that the Minister responded to all the points made in the European Scrutiny Committee reports. Will he answer the specific questions raised in paragraph 1.21 of the fourth report? He fudged some answers, possibly unintentionally. Does he, and do the UK and other member states, intend to encourage Ukraine to apply to join the EU in due course? If not, why does the common strategy specifically offer support to Ukraine in approximating its legislation on the acquis communautaire?<br><br>
I hope that the common strategy is not a belated sop on the part of the EU to take Ukraine seriously to compensate for the fact that, as has been argued in some quarters, the EU has failed to deal successfully with Ukraine over the past decade. Certainly, a failure to deal and trade with Ukraine could have serious political and strategic consequences for the EU.<br><br>
Ukraine's military and strategic relationship with Europe has been led by the United States and NATO. With the exception of an initial hesitation in giving up Ukraine's nuclear arsenal, the Ukrainians have behaved especially well in fulfilling their strategic responsibilities, as I am sure that all hon. Members would agree.<br><br>
Ukraine's record on national minority rights is probably better than that of many other post-Soviet states. Hon. Members asked about the death penalty and the abuse of human rights. If the Minister cannot give us the categorical assurances on which he touched in his opening statement, we should like him to undertake to review developments, make inquiries and ensure that hon. Members are kept informed of the reality in Ukraine.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0767">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
Ukraine's political relationships with the outside world have involved misunderstanding and missed opportunities. Although the Ukrainians must take some responsibility for that situation, western Europe must also take some responsibility. The transition from an authoritarian, Soviet state to a pluralistic society is not easy, especially for a country such as Ukraine, which is divided by language, religion and identity. Indeed, it is often said that Ukraine is on a religious fault line; it has to deal with so many factions. For several years it has lagged behind in economic and political reform. As hon. Members have said, corruption is significant, and all those who have visited Ukraine have seen such problems.<br><br>
Notwithstanding all that, the EU must make up its mind about Ukraine. Will Ukraine ultimately be offered a role in the EU, or will it stay outwith the EU? The EU does not know where Ukraine fits. Some countries—notably the UK and Holland—have taken Ukraine's position seriously and said that there is a possibility that it could be brought into the European fold of nations, but other states do not include Ukraine in the EU's vision of Europe.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will specifically address that point, especially given the remarks of Guenter Verheugen, the Comissioner for Enlargement, who told the European Parliament that it was irresponsible to suggest that Russia or Ukraine should be placed in a slow-track group of countries waiting to join the EU. He also told its foreign affairs Committee that anyone who thinks that Ukraine should be taken into the EU should argue that Mexico should become part of the United States. I hope that the Minister will comment on those remarks and explain where he thinks Ukraine's future lies.<br><br>
Ukraine's foreign policy aim always seems to be to find a balance between good relations with Russia and forging close links with western Europe, the EU and NATO. We must respond to that difficult position as Ukraine tries to strike that balance. I stress that if the EU is unable to find a place in Europe for Ukraine, it will send out negative signals; it will tell Ukraine that it is outside the European fold of nations and it will tell Russia that Ukraine is not considered to be in western Europe's sphere of influence, which will strengthen the hands of those in Russia and Ukraine who want the two states to reunify, which is not in our interests. We must be careful because any listless attitude to Ukraine could be damaging.<br><br>
Ukraine has much potential, which is noted in the tone of the common strategy paper, but we must be clearer in our minds about our intentions and those of the EU towards Ukraine, so that Ukraine has an element of certainty against which to set its future programmes and deals. The failure of the political relationship with Ukraine could present a great threat to the EU and western Europe. If Ukraine is cold-shouldered, even reunification with Russia could be possible. We must not send the wrong signals to Ukraine because it could pursue policies that are damaging for the rest of the world.<br><br>
The Ukrainian Ministery of Defence alone has debts of about US$226 billion, and it is allocated only $417
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
million, so the armed forces could make a percentage gain from exporting military equipment. There is significant pressure on the military, who are starved of cash, to encourage the sale of arms to countries and people who may not have the best intentions. Destabilisation or failure by the EU to provide encouragement for Ukraine's future path of stability is a substantial threat, and we should not forget it.<br><br>
We cannot help Ukraine if the country's people do not wish to help themselves. Most members of the Committee have had an opportunity to read about the chaos in yesterday's Parliament and I am sure that we all hope that the flare-up will be over quickly and that new-found stability can be built. I hope that the Minister will send a signal to Ukraine that the EU is willing to extend its hand of friendship and will not rule it out with the family of western democracies. In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood and other colleagues, I support the common strategy and I look forward to hearing about progress as the strategy comes to fruition.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Keith Vaz)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an excellent debate, summed up when the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood spoke of unanimity of purpose. We all want Ukraine to succeed but we also recognise that it faces formidable difficulties, which will not be overcome readily or easily in the next few years. Fulfilling the objectives will take longer than that and will demand patience, energy and encouragement.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North recognised that Ukraine has suffered greatly, having been put through enormous pain. It is trying hard in its own way to come to terms with its history and to prepare itself for the future. Notwithstanding the events that occurred in the Ukraine Parliament yesterday, as reported in today's <i>Financial Times,</i> we believe that there is a stable democracy in Ukraine, but we do not take it for granted. Nothing should be taken for granted in a country that attained democracy only nine years ago. We must support and encourage it.<br><br>
My hon. Friend also mentioned economic reform. He is right that political colonialism should not be replaced by economic colonialism, as Ukraine rushes headlong into the private sector before knowing exactly what the private sector is. Surely the lesson of eastern Europe is that one master should not be replaced with another. Endorsing the market and having a fair approach to economic policy means that contracts and the conduct of trade cannot be in the hands of a few. Opportunities must be open and available to all. We all want that to happen and we all want to avoid repeating previous mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree with some of the comments in the newspapers, suggesting that the EU could help Ukraine by encouraging and increasing trade opportunities? The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood mentioned the Antonov production facility. There may be considerable potential for exporting Antonov products to Europe, which could make a great difference to the Ukraine's economy.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The European Union certainly has an important role to play in increasing trade with Ukraine. We also have a role to play through our missions abroad and through our commercial activities. Where British companies wish to be involved in Ukraine, we must ensure that they have the necessary access. Last night, I met a British businessman at an event in Canary wharf. When I mentioned that I would be speaking on Ukraine this morning, he told me that he had just returned from Ukraine after spending two years there. He said that the potential for business was enormous, provided there was political and economic stability. The crux of the matter is how to provide that stability. The links that the European Union can cement in trade and commerce are particularly important.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Ms Jones), who was also an observer at the elections, reminded us that we should not be gung-ho and believe that everything is wonderful. We know that the democracy is not perfect and that improvements are needed, and we have noted my hon. Friend's comments in that regard. Perhaps more than any hon. Member, she knows the pitfalls, because she has visited Ukraine and monitored an election there. However, while we should acknowledge that those pitfalls exist, we should not be discouraged. We should move forward and try to ensure that the problems are resolved for the next time.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Mrs. Gordon) talked about Valerie Howard and Childline. I pay tribute to her constituent for the fantastic work that that organisation does. I had no idea before this morning that Childline provided that kind of support for children from that part of the world. I assumed, as others may have done, that it was merely a helpline for children in this country who were suffering abuse. I find it incredible that it is involved in that work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gordon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about a different organisation that deals specifically with children affected by Chernobyl. They come over each year and stay with families who take them round London and to lots of events. A group is due to come over in the spring.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise and I am glad to know that that other organisation exists. Clearly, the reason that I did not know that Childline was involved is that it is not.<br><br>
I am grateful for all the work that is done to build up personal relations between us and Ukrainian families. Since I became the Minister for Europe, I have noticed that British people like being in the European Union and forming relationships of that kind with families from elsewhere in Europe. This is an opportunity for us to blend with the wider Europe, beyond the 15.<br><br>

The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) talked in her usual eloquent and penetrating way about Ukraine's position in relation to the European Union. I repeat what I said: Ukraine is not ready to be a candidate for European Union membership. Under article 49, any European country that satisfies the conditions of article 6(1) of the treaty is eligible to become a member, The hon. Lady mentioned Guenter Verheugen; no one knows more than he about enlargement.<br><br>
The point is that Ukraine is a European country and, although it is not yet ready for EU membership, it would like to position itself in Europe politically as it is positioned geographically. Some time in the next 10 years, four of its neighbours will become members of the EU. To anyone who is asking for a target date for Ukraine attaining membership, I can say that it is a very long way off. There is no problem with it becoming familiar with the intentions and practices of the acquis, if it wants to orientate itself in that direction, and there is no reason why we should dash its hopes of doing business and being involved with the UK and the EU, but candidate status is a long, long way off. The hon. Lady summed it up very carefully. We do not wish to cold-shoulder or reject Ukraine; we want to help it to solve its problems and move on.<br><br>
Chernobyl was mentioned. The Government and the EU stand ready to help with the terrible legacy of that in any way that they can. We must encourage the Ukrainian Government to move forward.<br><br>
Like the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham and other hon. Members, I believe that the common strategy is a good strategy. It is a commitment to activity at EU level and will run for four years. It should not be condemned in advance—it must be given a chance to succeed. I look forward to returning to the Committee to discuss what has been achieved and what can still be achieved in the future.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 13523/2/99, the Common Srategy on Ukraine, and the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum dated 31 January 2000 from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on the Presidency's work plan on the implementation of the Common Strategy of the European Union on Ukraine; supports the Government's objective of developing closer, constructive relations with Ukraine; and agrees that the Common Strategy has the potential to make a significant contribution towards strengthening the EU-Ukraine relationship.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at six minutes to Twelve o'clock.</i></p>
