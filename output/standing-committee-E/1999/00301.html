Humanitarian Aid and External Co-operation</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>[<i>Relevant documents: European Union Document No. 6366/97, European Court of Auditors Special Report No. 2/97 on humanitarian aid from the European Union 1992-95. European Union Document No. 10694/98, the Commission's Annual Report on humanitarian aid 1997.</i>]</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. I am sorry to raise a point of order so early, but I need your guidance. As has happened on many occasions when I have had the privilege of addressing the Committee, the documentation for the debate has been delivered extremely late to members of the Committee—certainly the Opposition Members. We have had only a few hours to scrutinise the documents, and a large chunk of them was not available until 5 o'clock yesterday evening.<br><br>
Would it be in order to ask for the Committee to be adjourned to allow hon. Members to scrutinise the documentation fully? It is complex, and deals with sensitive issues of humanitarian aid, and it is not right that we should nod it through or pay cursory attention to the content of the documents, much of which is criticism. We would not be doing our job if we did not take the time to read the documentation, analyse it and question the Minister in detail.<br><br>
Other Opposition Members may wish to make comments, but bearing in mind the gravity of the issues that we are about to discuss, I hope that you will allow me to move the adjournment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Jenny Tonge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond Park)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Michie. I support the hon. Lady's point, because I also received the papers yesterday, and I instantly recognised that they were of great importance. We have debated aid from Europe and the efficiency of the delivery of aid many times. The report on humanitarian aid is the size of a telephone directory, yet we were given less than 24 hours to scrutinise it. I am a fairly new Member, and I tried hard. I carried the report with me all day—and even took it into the smallest room of the house, which is a favourite place for contemplation, reading and meditation in my family. That did no good. I put it under my pillow, hoping that I would absorb it by osmosis—but that did not happen. We have not had enough time. Approving the report without proper consideration will bring the House, and especially the Committee, into disrepute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr. George Foulkes)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Michie. I realised only at the start of the sitting that the Opposition Front-Bench spokespersons had not seen the documents until
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
yesterday. I have been able to make only initial inquiries, but I understand that the documents were circulated to all members of the Committee last Tuesday, and the normal requirement is for provision by the Thursday before the sitting. The hon. Ladies are not members of the Committee, but many of their colleagues are, and presumably they work closely with them. Therefore the documents should have been immediately available to the hon. Ladies from last Tuesday onwards.<br><br>
I admit that there has been one mistake. A set of documents should have been put in the Vote Office. That was not done, and I apologise. After the sitting, I will ask why that did not happen and ensure that it does not happen again. However, that will not, or should not, have created any difficulties for members of the Committee. The documents have been available for some time to members not only of this Committee, but of the Scrutiny Committee, which has considered each of the six documents several times. That Committee also has Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members, so the documents have been available to them.<br><br>
I understand the hon. Ladies' problems, because over the past few days I have been dealing with the crisis in Mozambique and several other matters. However, I have been able to go through the papers during the past 24 hours and, as you know, Mrs, Michie, preparing to answer questions is much more difficult than preparing to ask them. I am ready to answer any questions asked by the hon. Lady and other members of the Committee. It is in the interests of the House that we proceed. I am happy to spend as much time today as is necessary to give the matter full scrutiny, because it is right that we should do so. Apart from one small mistake, for which I have apologised, everything has been done properly. The documents have been available—in some cases for months—and the full folder of documents has been available to all members of the Standing Committee since last Tuesday. It would therefore be unhelpful to you, Mrs. Michie, to members of the Committee and to other hon. Members if the Committee were now to adjourn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's confession that the proper procedures for making the papers available to the official Opposition were not followed, it is even more imperative that you consider the request to adjourn the Committee. It is appalling for a Minister to claim overwork as an excuse for a grave oversight. Her Majesty's loyal Opposition are supposed to be able to scrutinise documentation and therefore to carry out their role as an Opposition, To say, that Front Benchers should get a buckshee copy from their Back Benchers does not help us in our deliberation and scrutiny of the documents.<br><br>
I have further points of order on this set of documents, but I hope, Mrs. Michie, that you will seriously consider my request and that of the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge), who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, to adjourn the Committee until we have had time to evaluate the documents properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The situation is regrettable. The hon. Lady will have noted that the Minister has apologised. The provision of documentation to members of the Committee and other hon. Members is a matter for the Government. I gather that it is the hon. Lady's wish that the Committee do now adjourn.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Michle. I am sorry to delay the Committee further, but as the Government have used their majority to railroad through the scrutiny of the documentation, despite its having appeared late, I would like your guidance on some of the content of the available documentation. In the document that I received from the Vote Office and have annotated, there are large chunks written in French. Should documentation be presented in French, and apparently without a translation, to a Committee of this nature? I can read a little French, but the documentation is of some size and complexity, and some items do not have an instant translation next to them. Should we accept the documentation, and can we proceed with the scrutiny, when the papers have been presented in French?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Michie. If the hon. Lady were a regular member of the Committee she would know that the phenomenon of parts of the documentation being in French is fairly common. We have complained about that before, but the Government have no power to do anything about it. We receive the documents as they are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, I cannot be a regular member of the Committee because I am an Opposition Front-Bench spokesman. I am sure that the matter has been raised before, but it is right to raise it again because it inhibits the process of scrutiny. Not all Members of the House or the Committee are fluent in French, and it is appalling that the documentation should be presented without a translation.<br><br>
I ask for your ruling, Mrs. Michle, on whether that is acceptable, or whether we should adjourn until full translations are made available to members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, all documents referred to the Committee are available in English. The matter is perhaps one for debate with the Minister later. At the moment everything is in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. From the research that I have done it appears that a part of the documentation, which the Government are ostensibly putting up for scrutiny by the Committee, was discussed in Brussels on 11 November 1999, at the 2215th Council meeting on development. Can you tell me whether some of the documentation has already been discussed at a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Council meeting before any Member of the House has had an opportunity to speak on it, or to scrutinise what the Government are doing? Is it true that the Government have already acted on part of the documentation, and that bringing it to the Committee today—after the event—is a mere sham? I would like your guidance as to whether the Committee ought to accept documentation that was discussed at a Council meeting last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be able to confirm that at a later point in the debate. Everything is in order at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that it is appropriate for the spokespersons of both Opposition parties to raise objections, but during the friendly discussion that I had last night with the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) she did not raise informally any of the points that she has made today. I have discussed them informally with my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), the Whip, who says that none of those matters was raised with him. Otherwise, we would certainly have considered any of those points.<br><br>
It is strange that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham initially wanted to postpone our discussion, but now raises a question implying that it is too late to discuss the matter—she cannot have it both ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, the hon. Lady can try.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I now call the Minister to make an opening statement.</span></p>
<p>10.46 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members will recall that, during the Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall last month, I explained the steps that the Government had taken to help to improve the effectiveness of European Community development assistance. I also accepted that there was still a long way to go, which is why I welcome the opportunity for further discussion of the documents referred to the Committee by the Scrutiny Committee.<br><br>
The biggest challenge facing the world in the new millennium is the fact that one in four of our fellow human beings lives in extreme poverty; many are starving to death. The European Commission has a vital role to play in helping to eliminate that poverty. The EC is the second-largest multilateral donor, spending 5 billion euros a year. Through the Department for International Development, the United Kingdom contributes about 18 per cent. of that amount—that represents 30 per cent. of the DFID budget. Our principal focus is on EC humanitarian aid, but I will, of course, be happy to take questions on issues arising from any of the documents. I may have some difficulty with those in French, but I shall do my best.<br><br>
The documents on EC humanitarian aid cover the period from 1992 to 1999 and mainly focus on the activities of ECHO—the European Community Humanitarian Office—which was set up in 1991. ECHO'S budget has grown from 335 million euros in 1992 to 800 million in 1999. Together with the donations from member states, that accounts for about half of worldwide humanitarian aid—a really staggering total.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0775">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The aid is intended to benefit people in poorer countries who have suffered as a result of conflict or natural disasters such as we see, tragically, in Mozambique today.<br><br>
The Court of Auditors' report focuses on ECHO'S activities from 1992 to 1995, which was a period of rapid growth, frenetic activity and substantial aid flows. However, there was also a lack of strategic thinking; there was no assessment of impact and very little external control. ECHO was, more or less, allowed to do its own thing.<br><br>
The humanitarian aid regulation of 1996 marked a watershed in relations between ECHO and member states. The regulation was, inevitably, a compromise; while meeting the understandable need to give ECHO the flexibility to respond quickly to crises, it also had to give member states more opportunity to influence those responses. The systems established by the regulation are not perfect. However, since the adoption of the regulation, ECHO has provided more, better quality information on its plans, and a culture of consultation and co-operation has evolved. For example, under the United Kingdom's EU presidency in 1998, the first joint field missions for ECHO and the member states were organised. Thankfully, that practice has continued.<br><br>
The recent evaluation of humanitarian operations confirms the improvement in ECHO's performance in recent years. However, it is also clear that there is still room for improvement. The issues needing attention include, first, ECHO'S mandate and its role in the so-called grey zone between relief and development; secondly, the coherence and co-ordination between ECHO, the rest of the Commission and the member states; thirdly, ECHO'S emergency response capacity and the question whether it should be able to mount its own aid operations; fourthly, relations with the United Nations and non-governmental organisations; and finally the promotion of disaster preparedness, an important matter in the light of what is happening at the moment.<br><br>
The Commission has responded positively to the evaluation. Some action is already in hand on, for example, staff training and personnel development. External consultations with member states and other interested parties are under way to learn from their experience. The Government are contributing constructively to that process, and we believe that ECHO is, by and large, doing a good job and genuinely wants to improve its performance.<br><br>
The Government continue to seek ways to improve the EC's performance. It is vital that we use our resources properly and, where improvements are needed, work together in a spirit of co-operation and common sense to put matters right. In December 1999, the British Government published an institutional strategy paper entitled "Working in Partnership with the European Community", which included 18 proposals to improve the effectiveness and increase the poverty focus of EC development assistance.<br><br>
I am pleased to say that our pro-Europe, pro-reform policy—which will find favour with at least one Opposition party—is paying dividends. Significant
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
progress has been made. We lobbied for rationalisation of the Commission's structure. Last year, the Commission was reorganised, and the number of Commissioners with development responsibilities has been reduced from five to two. We welcome that simplification, and we also welcome Neil Kinnock's proposal for broad reform of Commission financial issues and staff management.<br><br>
We have helped to negotiate a much-improved successor to the Lomé convention and the TACIS regulation, which we debated in May. We have also lobbied for a coherent statement of EC development policy, and we expect at last to receive the Commission's first draft later this month. We are working with member states to improve EC co-operation and co-ordination, and a large number of development experts from Britain have been seconded to the Commission. The integration by the Commission of the hitherto separate evaluation units into a single evaluation service has helped to improve accountability in the Commission and the design of future programmes.<br><br>
The Commission is also drawing up an action plan to improve effectiveness, which will include simplified procedures, increased accountability, the production of an annual report and, above all, greater delegation of decision making to a national level, which member states have requested for some time.<br><br>
We welcome those improvements, but we are aware that there is still much to be done to improve the poverty focus and the effectiveness of EC assistance delivery. The Government will continue to work with the Commission, member states and members of the European Parliament to keep up the pressure for reform.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.43 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind Committee members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all Committee members to ask several questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his opening statement. I support and endorse his view that we must improve the effectiveness of EU aid, and I hope that he will remain engaged with the matter, but he will confirm that the Government have used those same phrases and words since they came to power, and we seem not to be making much progress.<br><br>
Sadly, events in Mozambique form the background to today's debate, and my first question concerns a paragraph in the documentation with which the Minister will be familiar. Consultants have highlighted specific challenges posed by circumstances—notably, natural disasters—that require a genuine operational emergency response capacity. At the moment, the EU has no such capacity, and has been able to do little to build capacity elsewhere. The report recommends that such efforts be stepped up. In the light of the current disaster, what steps will the Government take to ensure that that happens? Fine words and money are not enough. Greater emphasis must be placed on building partners' capacities, and I hope that the Minister will outline the steps to be taken towards achieving that aim.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0776">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is wrong to say that we have been talking but doing nothing. I gave seven examples of improvements that have taken place because of our actions. I appreciate that she may have been up all night and may not have heard them all, but I certainly spelled them out one by one, and I do not want to do so again, but I will if she wants.<br><br>
The prime responsibility for co-ordination on the ground in Mozambique rests with the Government there. All our reactions have been in response to their requests. We supported UNICEF and the Save the Children Fund, and gave money to Oxfam and similar agencies. I announced late last night that we are supporting five additional helicopters and sending two planes full of equipment and personnel to help.<br><br>
The co-ordination on the ground is also being carried out by the United Nations, in conjunction with the Government of Mozambique. There has been a suggestion, which is included in the document, that the European Union might play such a role. We are discussing that with the European Commission. However, one body needs to co-ordinate in each emergency, or there will be confusion, duplication and people falling over each other.<br><br>
For the current emergency, the European Commission, through ECHO, has already agreed to give 1 million euro and is considering—and may well agree to—a request for a further 2 million euro. That funding is available to agencies active on the ground in Mozambique that can carry out effective work at this stage.<br><br>
We shall have further discussions with the European Commission to see whether ECHO'S role in co-ordinating activities can be increased in areas in which it could be the leading organisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lepper <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Pavilion)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to my hon. Friend's response to the previous question, I believe that he will agree that co-ordination between ECHO and other transnational agencies, such as the United Nations, the Red Cross and the Red Crescent, is essential. Will he highlight some of the ways in which the Government are encouraging our European partners to achieve such co-ordination?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. As donors, the United Kingdom Government and ECHO support and give resources to organisations such as the Red Cross, Oxfam or Mèdecins sans Frontières, that have a track record in a country. I apologise for my French accent. We will also support UNICEF and the other UN agencies. ECHO will do the same; that is its purpose. It is also sensible for it to co-ordinate in those cases in which it is appropriate to do so. However, when two or three organisations try to co-ordinate, there is inevitably overlap and confusion, which we and the European Commission want to avoid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tonge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like, if I dare, to congratulate the Minister, because there have been improvements in the way in which aid is being delivered through Europe, although not nearly enough. The most significant difference is the reduction from five to two in the number of Commissioners dealing with aid. There was immense
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
confusion before. Following the small amount of dipping into the report that I have managed in the past 24 hours, I did not get the same shock as when I looked at the Court of Auditors report on the delivery of development aid in South Africa, which contained glaring examples of inefficiency, delay and muddle. Money was not being spent and people were suffering as a result. That has not happened in this case, and ECHO has clearly been working at a much higher and more efficient level.<br><br>
To echo—a bit of a pun—other Committee members, and as I said to the Secretary of State on Monday, the most important requirement in assisting with natural disasters is a rapid response corps and a rapid response plan. I called for that from the United Nations—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Lady ask a question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tonge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am asking a question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady take her seat for a minute? Committee members should ask questions as succinctly as they can. We shall have a debate later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tonge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mrs. Michic. I have to leave early, and I suppose that I was cheating a little.<br><br>
My question is, what plans does the Minister have to talk to his colleagues in the European Union about setting up a rapid response corps for natural disasters? The idea is not to have supplies sitting there waiting, and doing nothing in between times, but to ensure that an inventory has been carried out and we know where supplies are. We will know where helicopters can be obtained, and cut down on the tragic delays that occur whenever there are natural disasters such as those in central America and Mozambique.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for her congratulations, which she is perfectly entitled to give, and I am grateful to receive.<br><br>
It is true that there have not been sufficient improvements, but we are not complacent. That is why, when I was in Strasbourg a couple of weeks ago, I talked to the Development Commissioner and Members of the European Parliament, including the chairmen of the development and budget Committees, about further improvements to make the delivery of Commission aid more effective and more poverty focused. That includes, most importantly, delegation to the countries concerned, so that decisions can be made quickly and effectively.<br><br>
The hon. Lady mentioned the rapid reaction corps. She received a reply on that subject when she raised it with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I am not sure whether she would prefer the EU or the UN to deal with it. We want to achieve a more effective way of dealing with emergencies, and the UN and its agencies probably represent the most appropriate means. That would involve all the countries of the world that are able to provide, or earmark, any resources for an arrangement such as she proposes. We want to discuss the matter with our European partners, who will be able to make a positive contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee has discussed the European Union budget in relation to other documents, we have often noticed the tension between the anxiety of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0777">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
the EU to develop the countries on its borders—on the Mediterranean and in eastern Europe—and the wish of Britain and other countries to help those in the greatest need. Many of those in the greatest need are not close to the EU. What are the Government seeking to do to accentuate the focus on poverty reduction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has, as usual, put his finger on one of the key points. For next year, the Commission has provisionally earmarked 1 billion euro for the middle east development assistance programme, which deals with relatively rich Mediterranean countries. It is astonishing that the biggest recipient of European Community assistance is Morocco, rather than the really poor countries of sub-Saharan Africa. It has also allocated 5.5 billion euro for Balkan reconstruction. Although we strongly support Balkan reconstruction, we believe that it is not possible to spend that sum of money over the proposed period, and that it has been allocated for political reasons. That is why we argue that more resources should go into the other programmes—I know that all my hon. Friends support this—which will help countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America, where many really poor people need help not only from us, bilaterally, but also from what we can give through the European Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wycombe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee's deliberations would be facilitated if we had more concrete information about particular ECHO projects. For example, does the Minister, or the Department, have a view on which are the most or the least successful projects? If they have, what lessons can be learnt from either kind? We have had discussions about the dreadful tragedy in Mozambique. Sadly, it is too early to draw any conclusions. My first reaction is that the international response was not as satisfactory or quick as it might have been. If we had more concrete evidence instead of a lot of airy-fairy words, we would make more progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 1997 and 1998 annual reports show how well ECHO is doing in relation to certain programmes. For example, the 1997 annual report deals with work in the former Yugoslavia and the great lakes region of Africa. I know that there have been time problems, but if the hon. Gentleman has an opportunity to look at some of the details in the annual reports, he will find some clear comparisons between where ECHO considers that it has been successful and where it believes there is room for improvement.<br><br>
We share ECHO'S views. We also share its concern that there should be more co-ordination and coherence between its programmes and other European Commission work, and between its work and that of the 15 member states. We are talking to ECHO about that. If we and ECHO are working in the great lakes region or the former Yugoslavia, for example, we should co-operate more effectively. We are arguing that point strongly, and 1 accept that there is room for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like other hon. Members, I am concerned about the situation in Mozambique and the failure to respond quickly enough to the urgent needs of its people following the floods.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
In view of the EU's bureaucratic problems in organising many nations to launch an aid programme, is it not sensible in the medium to longer term to retain a substantial national capacity to deliver aid? While I welcome all the EU's efforts and strongly support EU aid, I trust my hon. Friend the Minister and his fellow Ministers to deliver quickly more than I trust the Commission at this stage. I shall not press the point further. Does he agree that we must retain a strong national capacity to deliver humanitarian aid, particularly in emergencies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his positive point in relation to our bilateral programme. The credit goes not to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and me but to the excellent people in our Department. The conflict and humanitarian affairs department has some excellent people. We have people out in Mozambique who are working morning, noon and night to assess the needs and tell us in London what needs to be done, and we are delivering our assistance.<br><br>
The percentage that we are providing to the European Commission was agreed by the previous Government. I say that looking particularly at Conservative Members, at least one of whom is a Euro-sceptic. The percentage was agreed at the Edinburgh summit and unless it is changed at another summit we must continue with it. The amount being spent on development assistance is increasing and will continue to increase year on year, It increased by 28 per cent. under the comprehensive spending review. As our absolute total spending increases, the relative proportion of our budget that goes to the European Community will decline. I am sure that the hon. Member for Ruislip—Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) would welcome that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that all Committee members want value for money from the humanitarian aid programme. That is not unique to this country; it is being attempted across the European Union. Why is the evaluation department of the Department for International Development to move from the London headquarters? Is the purpose to bring it near to the Minister's home base, or will operational improvements result?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All such decisions are finally approved by the Secretary of State, who comes from Birmingham and represents a Birmingham constituency. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, the Department has two headquarters in the United Kingdom: one in Victoria street, and one in East Kilbride in Scotland. They do complementary jobs, and both do effective work. The London headquarters is increasingly overcrowded, but we have room in East Kilbride, especially as the demands on the pensions department become smaller as former colonial servants die off.<br><br>
We have looked for areas that can be sensibly relocated, without difficulty, to East Kilbride. In each case, trade union agreement has been obtained, and the relocation has proved effective. It is cheaper to run parts of the Department from East Kilbride than it would be from the centre of London. We are getting value for money, to which the hon. Gentleman rightly referred. I might not have the agreement of all Committee members on that, but I am sure that you, Mrs. Michie, would support me.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0778">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wycombe (Sir Raymond Whitney) suggested that we look at specific projects. The documentation contains a number of constructive evaluations. Does my hon. Friend agree that the general tendency is for projects to be effective at the level of individual activity but for criticism to be made of the lack of co-ordination. Will he take the initiative and try to achieve co-ordination of relatively large projects such as TACIS? A more sustained and focused overall impact would be desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Again and again, the question of co-ordination is raised. However, criticism has also been levelled at individual projects, especially in relation to underspend or delays in spending. In addition to greater co-ordination, there should be greater delegation to the country officers, so that decisions can be made quickly at local level. That will also improve performance. I think that he will agree with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The common bond across the Committee is that we all want expenditure in this area to reach those who are most in need, in the most effective and efficient way possible. The recommendations in the consultants' report on the personnel aspect of ECHO are therefore alarming. It is gratifying that the consultants pay tribute to the commitment and professionalism of the staff, whether at the headquarters or in the field, but they raise serious questions about the management and internal organisation of ECHO. The most frequently criticised element is the management of the organisation.<br><br>
In its response, the Commission highlighted some of the reasons and passed the buck by saying that its rules and procedures are determined at Commission level, by the Council or the European Parliament. What rules and procedures flowing from the Commission, the Council or the Parliament affect the efficient operation of ECHO? What plans has the Minister been privy to on pooling between ECHO and the office of the Director General for Development? What methods would he use to evaluate any improvement in productivity and training of staff?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We agree that the consultants' report is important. It was compiled by an international team of 15 well-respected consultants who work for Franklin Advisory Service. It is a comprehensive and perceptive evaluation and we agree with many of its conclusions and proposals. The Commission remains a bureaucratic organisation and some of that bureaucracy is self-imposed but, as the hon. Lady rightly said, some is caused by the requirement for accountability to European taxpayers. We must get the balance right between efficiency, effectiveness and speed of operation; and accountability and scrutiny.<br><br>
Improvements have been made and one, to which the hon. Lady referred, is that ECHO is now the responsibility of the Director General for Development, Poul Nielson, so responsibility has been brought together with other areas of development. That will help in relation to one of the criticisms about the grey area when the Commission moves from immediate relief and humanitarian assistance to longer-term development activities. That will be a real improvement emanating from the consultants' report and from the pressure that we and other Governments have exerted.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear the Minister's comments, but they sound like warm words because there is no timetable, no plan, no sell-by date for the old abominations and no date for the new streamlined ECHO within the Directorate-General. Can the Minister give a timetable and tell us when we shall see the improvements and the implementation of the Commission's fine words that its firm intention is to address the issue? When will the changes be made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Council has asked the Commission specifically to produce a paper on the way in which the development function will be carried out. We hope to receive that paper later this month. We have asked the Commission to give a clear indication of the improvements to be made.<br><br>
The White Paper produced by Commissioner Kinnock also addresses staff training, financial management, the need for streamlining and the delegation of responsibility. Chris Patten and Poul Nielson are dealing with foreign affairs and development and Neil Kinnock is dealing with efficiency. We are exerting pressure. We shall demand reports on efficiency and effectiveness at the Development Council and the General Affairs Council and we shall keep up the pressure. We agree with the hon. Lady that it is our taxpayers' money that is being spent and we want to ensure that it is spent effectively for the purpose intended: poverty eradication.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Returning to one of the notorious points of order of the hon, Member for Chesham and Amersham, English and French are the European Union's working languages and all documents must be translated into those languages. Examples of slipshod translation and editing include documentation in which currencies are indicated with question marks throughout. This is not the first time that the problem has arisen, so will my hon. Friend discuss with the Commission the quality of the documents that they deliver to us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My officials would be able to confirm that that strikes a chord with me. The title and format of papers and the numbering of pages are confusing and there must be an improvement in the way in which they are produced, with a standard method of production and clearer titling and numbering. We have done that in the Department for International Development and we have been told that our publications are more effective, better, more understandable, more readable and more accessible then they used to be and they do not have to be paid for. Access to the website is even better.<br><br>
My hon. Friend made a good point, with which I agree strongly, and I assure him that I shall take it up with the Commission at the earliest opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that his Department's publications are more accessible and that they do not have to be paid for. He omitted to say that they are much more expensive and that taxpayers pay for them.<br><br>
I want to put more pressure on the Minister for a timetable. I accept that he has the same aims as Opposition Members for a new, improved European aid machine, but he has avoided the question of the timetable. He referred to reports being delivered and to future meetings and discussions, but he did not provide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0779">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
any dates for those exercises. Will he tell us the date by which he expects to see some action? He should make a guesstimate and tell us the United Kingdom's deadline.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We expect the Commission to produce proposals for a more coherent link between relief and development by July 2000. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Lady.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) referred to question marks in the documents. They denote euros, which is interesting. The information technology system cannot cope and, unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), who is an IT fanatic, I am an IT-sceptic, but a euro fanatic. That explanation reinforces my scepticism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lepper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer to my hon. Friend the Minister's comment on the importance of decision making in individual countries on relief and development aid. We all recognise that since the events at Seattle towards the end of last year, the relationship between European Union countries and other richer countries, and countries that are recipients of aid can never be the same again. Statements from my hon. Friend and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry show that the Government have taken that on board. What evidence is there that the same lessons have been learnt by our European partners, and will they inform future deliberations and strategy on aid?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend had been at the UNCTAD meeting in Bangkok—I was unable to attend, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development attended—he would have been encouraged by the post-Seattle discussions, which were more constructive and sympathetic to developing countries and took those issues on board. Not only Britain but other European countries gave that response. It is right that my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for International Development and for Trade and Industry are taking a more sympathetic view.<br><br>
I mentioned the new Lomé convention, which will be signed in Suva in Fiji later this year—I think in early June. We negotiated the convention all through the night—it was just like the House of Commons—and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development, Baroness Amos and I attended the discussions on different occasions. Department for International Development officials worked tremendously hard, and we achieved a good outcome for the 71 ACP—Africa, Caribbean and Pacific—countries, which of course include most of the poorest countries of the world. We secured much better trade and aid relations with the European Union and made a big step in its relations with developing countries. When the matters are finalised, I expect that myself or my right hon. Friend will report to the House in more detail on the specific follow-up to the Lomé negotiations. That was an encouraging development in our relations with the poorest countries in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the tagged documents from the Commission is its 1998 annual report on the TACIS programme. Is the Minister satisfied with the way in which the programme is evolving in Russia? Does he believe that the disbursement of money in Russia should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
be modified through TACIS, in view of the murderous and genocidal war being waged by Russian forces against the Chechen people? Does he feel that TACIS disbursement should be limited to nuclear safety and to the retraining of former Soviet military officers rather than to the many other wide fields to which it is assigned? Should not economic sanctions apply to the TACIS programme, or does the Minister believe that rehabilitation in the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in Azerbaijan has no precedents for the rehabilitation of Chechnya through TACIS?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made an important point that shows the value of Committees and debates such as these. Sadly, 185,000 internally displaced people are living in Ingushetia, which is an indication of the tragedy of Russian activity in Chechnya. In view of that problem, the European Community has decided to impose sanctions and preparation of the Russian indicative programme covering the period 2000-03 has been suspended. Meanwhile, the Commission is preparing a limited core programme for 2000, which will concentrate on democracy, the rule of law, the environment and civil society, as well as nuclear safety, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned.<br><br>
The Commission is also considering the transfer of TACIS funds to ECHO for humanitarian assistance. Activities under existing projects will not be disrupted. Meanwhile, as the hon. Gentleman knows, there is a political dialogue on Chechnya with our Russian counterparts at European Union ministerial level. My right hon. and hon. Friends in the Foreign Office are closely involved in those discussions. I hope that he thinks that those are the right sort of activities.<br><br>
We have been anxious to ensure that official development activities with Russia are suspended in the meantime. However, it is proper to try to continue and to enhance our programme for helping people in Russia in respect of civil society, democracy and human rights, as well as with nuclear safety, which affects us all. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that the European Union and the Government have achieved the right balance on events in Chechnya.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tonge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment more fully on the co-ordination between ECHO and other agencies? I am constantly worried when I visit disaster areas by the plethora of NGOs and others competing to provide aid. The document rather sweetly entitled "New Version" contains a wonderful sentence summing up my confusion. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>ECHO financed NGOs via the UNHCR in a spirit of solidarity, and in the interests of co-ordination and efficiency given the scale of the crisis—</p></blockquote>
this was in the great lakes region—
<br><blockquote><p>and not in order to simplify administrative follow-up.</p></blockquote>
How does the Minister feel about that co-ordination and the financing of one organisation through another? Is it efficient?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have encouraged ECHO to develop a dialogue with NGOs to involve them much more in programming at field level, as we are doing in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0780">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Department for International Development. Progress is being made in the right direction, but as with so many things today there is room for improvement. The framework partnership agreement that has been produced is an example of the move away from a purely contractual relationship with the NGOs. British NGOs, rightly, have received good funding from ECHO when they have been the best placed to intervene. That is another move in the right direction by ECHO.<br><br>
Necessary lessons are beginning to be learnt, but there is still more to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend on his robust view of the Russian intervention, which contrasted strikingly with the shadow Foreign Secretary's expression of sympathy for the Russian action.<br><br>
Does my hon. Friend agree that the trade aspect of the matter is in many cases as important as the aid? Should not we try to avoid further farcical situations such as that in which the South African trade agreement was held up by demands that South Africa should swear never to produce grappa—which has never been produced there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In some ways trade and investment are even more important than development assistance. The figures show that foreign direct investment overwhelms the sums for development assistance. It is vital to achieve the right trade relations, as I said with reference to the Lomé renegotiations, and to encourage investment and bring about the right conditions for it.<br><br>
We were disappointed that some European Union countries that rushed to shake the hand of President Mandela when he took office, and who wanted an EU-South Africa trade negotiation, held matters up. First Spain and Portugal did so in relation to sherry and port, and more recently Greece and Italy did it with ouzo and grappa. We pressed and pressed on the South Africans' behalf. The matter is now concluded, but later than it should have been. We understand the need to protect vital interests, and we protect ours, but the interests thus protected should genuinely be vital ones.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue the line of questioning by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood about the TACIS fund. I am sure that the Minister knows that the Foreign Affairs Committee has produced a significant report on the United Kingdom's relations with Russia. During the evaluation process it examined the TACIS fund. I hope that the Minister has had an opportunity to read the evidence. Among the recommendations was one directly commending to the International Development Committee a way forward with respect to the TACIS fund.<br><br>
Evidence was taken from Professor Hampson, who is—and this should warm the Minister's heart—Professor of the Political Economy of Russia and Eastern Europe at the university of Birmingham. He was of the opinion that a lot of EU programmes are a boondoggle for some people on the EU side and on the Russian side. For those who do not speak the language that the professor is using, boondoggle apparently means
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
dishonest undertaking or fraud. The Minister's preoccupation with fraud probably matches my own. In his reply to my hon. Friend he rightly referred to ways in which funds from TACIS could be transferred to other programmes. Will he also tell the Committee whether he envisages putting in place a stricter regime to ensure that money is not fraudulently siphoned off, because it would appear that the fraud and dishonesty are endemic throughout all programmes at present, and not least TACIS?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We took the opportunity of the negotiations for a new TACIS regulation to ensure a substantial change in TACIS which, as I said earlier, we have achieved. TACIS will now take much more account of the social and environmental aspects of transition, by not simply privatising and closing down industries but dealing with those who become unemployed as a result of the transition. We also negotiated measures to improve the quality, speed and effectiveness of the programme.<br><br>
We have managed to retain TACIS as a technical assistance instrument, which is the main source of its effectiveness and importance, in spite of pressure to move in another direction. There was also great pressure to spend more of the budget on investment, but we resisted that. There is now much more emphasis on the social impact of transition. That shows how the Government, by engaging with the European Community and taking these renegotiation opportunities, can have a real impact. We have changed TACIS substantially along the lines suggested by the hon. Lady, the Select Committee and others.<br><br>
Fraud is not peculiar to European Community programmes. It has even been known to occur in the United Kingdom from time to time. What matters is not whether fraud takes place but how the organisation—the structure—deals with it. In the United Kingdom we have relatively good ways of identifying fraud, rooting it out and dealing with it, and that is what we have argued should happen in the European Community, and it is happening more and more.<br><br>
We know about some of these frauds only because, increasingly, the European Court of Auditors and others have identified that they have taken place. In the Cote d'Ivoire fraud—I apologise for more French; I mean the Ivory Coast fraud, to translate it for Opposition Members—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Merci.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: De nada—a change of language.<br><br>
I am glad to say that all the money involved in the Ivory Coast fraud has been paid back, so it has been both discovered and dealt with. We want systems that ensure that there is no fraud, but if it takes place, we need systems to discover it, root it out and make sure that there is recompense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that reply. I was pleased to see that all the money had been reimbursed following the Ivory Coast debacle. However, it is a poor argument to say that only because we have good auditing techniques can we ferret out these frauds. We must move forward and stop the substantial number of frauds that are evident from the auditing programme.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0781">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
The amount that the United Kingdom hands over to Brussels is in excess of £780 million a year, and grows year on year. Is the Minister satisfied with the direction of EU aid and programmes or does he believe that more aid is given to Mediterranean countries, to stop the potential flow of immigrants, than to poorer countries? What is the Department's view on that observation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I dealt with the matter in answering a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, whose constituency traditionally has an interest in international development, and I agree with him and the hon. Lady. On reading the institutional strategy paper to which I referred, she will discover that one of our main concerns is the lack of poverty focus in respect of countries' donations to the European Community. That is why we have argued with the Commission, MEPs and other member states that more money should be made available to the poorest countries, and we shall continue to make that case. At the moment, just over 50 per cent. of Commission expenditure is spent on the least developed countries. We propose a target of 70 per cent.; indeed, our bilateral expenditure on the poorest countries is over 70 per cent. That is what we are all about. We have urged that a Commission expenditure target of 70 per cent. be set in respect of the least developed countries, and the matter is currently being taken up in Brussels and Strasbourg.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that response, but can he say when that target will be achieved? Neither he nor his Secretary of State has given a date by which an aid budget of 0.7 per cent. of GDP will be achieved. Once again, we hear fine words from the Minister, but there is no sell-by date. On what date will the target be reached?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I admire the hon. Lady's chutzpah.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The word is pronounced "hootspa".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what language I have drifted into, but it is not a Scottish word. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. In any event, that word provides a perfect description.<br><br>
The hon. Lady asks us to set a target date for achieving an aid budget of 0.7 per cent. of GDP. Under the previous Government, the 1979 figure of 0.52 per cent. declined to 0.26 per cent. Were they still in power, that figure would now be zero. We are moving forward steadily, year on year. The figure increased during our first two years in power, and it will continue to do so throughout the 15 or 20 years of this Labour Government. We will achieve a budget of 0.7 per cent. as quickly as possible.<br><br>
The hon. Lady also asks for a date in respect of the 70 per cent. target for European Commission spending on the poorest countries, and I can tell her that the target date is 2006.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings us to the end of the time allotted to questions.</span></p>
<p>10.42 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents Nos. 10705/99, the Commission's Annual Report on humanitarian aid 1998, 10497/99, the Commission's Annual Report on TACIS 1998, 11203/99, Commission staff working paper: Report for 1998 on the evaluation of external co-operation, and un-numbered Explanatory Memorandum from the Department for International Development dated 5 November 1999 on a Commission Communication on the assessment and future of Community humanitarian activities; and supports the Government's policy of working in partnership with the EC to improve the management, organisation and effectiveness of development assistance administered by the EC institutions.</p></blockquote>
Given that the questions from hon. Members have been many and varied, I will say no more.</span></p>
<p>11.43 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate started with points of order that bear repetition. Once again, papers were delivered late, and there has been a lack of attention to detail with regard to providing the Opposition with relevant material. I have little confidence that that will be remedied, and I hope that those who read <i>Hansard's</i> account of our deliberations will recognise that this is an on-going complaint. If this Committee is to carry out its work properly, something must be done. A substantial amount of material accompanies these debates, and we must have the opportunity to scrutinise the matter adequately.<br><br>
Hon. Members on both sides of the House share a general unease about European Union aid programmes. I must be fair to the Minister and to the Department in saying that I believe that he shares our views on cost-effectiveness, efficiency and transparency. However, while we may share views, we do not seem to be moving in the right direction, other than to dispense warm words, tea and sympathy.<br><br>
I appreciate that there have been structural changes. However, in answer to my question the Minister gave a target date of 2006. That is a long way down the road; the next Conservative Government could well be in office by then. I am sure that the Minister is aware that there is a good chance that his mob will be kicked out at the next election, and we shall once again sit on the other side of the House. We should certainly not be afraid to set targets. There is a feeling that this matter is not high on the agenda of the European Union, which seems more interested in navel-gazing and inward organisation than in its role in the wider world. In examining the European Union's handling of overseas aid, will the Minister ensure that he does not relinquish the pressure on the institutions and the Commission to improve their performance?<br><br>
We debated the Court of Auditors report, which contained horror stories about the misuse of aid. Fundamental criticisms of the structure of the organisations and of the way in which aid is delivered are hidden in the documentation. We are talking about money that will save people's lives. For that reason, I hope that the Minister will continue this work and assure us that the European structures will be strengthened so that we can fight corruption and deliver aid effectively to those most in need.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0782">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
I approve the motion, and have no intention of asking my colleagues to divide the Committee. I want to work in partnership with the European Union to improve the management organisation and the effectiveness of the development assistance administered by EC institutions. The Minister is making a reasonable start, but I am worried that he may go a little soft. I assure him that, if there is any danger of that happening, Her Majesty's Opposition will be here to help stiffen his backbone.</span></p>
<p>11.47 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say how much I enjoy the performances given by my hon. Friend the Minister in this Committee? They are always entertaining, even when dealing with serious subjects. His commitment to, and concern for, the poor of the world is obvious, but he always expresses himself well and entertains us at the same time, in a way that shows elan and joie de vivre, although perhaps not chutzpah.<br><br>
My serious point is that many members of the Committee groan when great volumes of paper thud on to their desks. However, the fault lies with the EU documentation, rather than with the better written documentation that we receive from Ministers, civil servants and servants of the House, who write very clearly. I sometimes cheat by skipping through the EU documentation and going straight to the explanatory memorandums and to the Select Committee reports, because they are easier to read and impart the essence of the matter.<br><br>
I hope that Ministers will be able to use their influence within the EU to persuade its draftsmen to write in a more succinct and direct way that communicates its real message. I sometimes get confused by their very long sentences, hints and undertones. Perhaps they suffer in translation, and I miss their essential poetry because they have been translated into English. I hope that the Minister will use his influence, at least to make the documents shorter and a little more lively.<br><br>
My concern centres on the question of whether aid should be delivered more through the EU, national Governments or the UN. A proportion of our aid is delivered through each of those routes, and if we are to maximise the benefit to those who need the aid—the world's poor—it is important that the delivery process is implemented in the most effective way. If one or other of the agencies is more efficient, perhaps we should channel more that way, or try to improve delivery processes through the other agencies by imitating the route taken by the Government. I have a prejudice that our Government do things better than the EU, and possibly even the UN, and we should spread good practice elsewhere.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham asked about the direction of EU aid, which appears to have underlying political motives that colour the essential altruistic and humanitarian concerns. A substantial shift has occurred—in relative, if not absolute, terms—from the poorest African, Caribbean and Pacific countries to eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. That is clearly to do with self-interest rather than altruism. While that is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
understandable, because all Governments act on self-interest to some extent, in this respect we have a moral duty to try to help the poorest most.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will continue to press for assistance to go to the poorest countries, rather than to those that might be of political benefit to the EU and EU member states. We should be proud of our Government and Chancellor for taking a lead on debt cancellation, which has made a tremendous difference. I hope that other nations will follow our lead. Will the Minister tell the Committee what progress the EU has made on debt cancellation and to what extent other nations have pursued it?<br><br>
I turn to the reform of the Lomé agreement, which I remember discussing more than 20 years ago, before I was a Member of Parliament. Lomé has undergone several reforms over that period. At that time, it was not simply about benefiting poorer countries; it involved a large element of self-interest in the form of protectionism for the EU. While I am not averse to a degree of structuring in international trade, I hope that the worst features of the old Lomé agreement are being eliminated. Lomé countries could export to the EU, but could not export goods with high value added. For example, they could export timber to the UK, but not furniture. The timber was produced in the poorer countries, but the high-value-added activity took place within the EU. There was even an arrangement whereby timber could not be transported from one Lomé country to another for sawmilling before it was exported. It had either to be sawmilled in that country and exported, or exported as unsawn logs.<br><br>
Such constraints were intended to protect the EU's economic interests, while having the superficial appearance of giving assistance to poorer nations. I hope that the Government will press constantly to ensure that Lomé is truly about helping poorer countries in respect of their export trade with the EU. Can my hon. Friend the Minister tell the Committee what progress is being made in that respect?<br><br>
Over the past two years, events in Seattle and elsewhere have revealed a significant change in attitudes to trade. This week, Mahathir Mohamed, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, said that unconstrained free trade benefits the richer nations and disadvantages the poorer nations. Our view of "free trade" should therefore be tempered by the understanding that it does not always benefit the weaker and poorer nations; it plays into the hands of the richest nations, and especially the large multinational corporations, which may not even benefit the developed countries. That is a note of caution.<br><br>
I have a large number of constituents who come from the Caribbean, some of them from St. Vincent, and I have been subjected to strong lobbying in relation to bananas. If completely free trade were allowed, and World Trade Organisation rulings on bananas were not resisted, certain Caribbean economies could be wiped out overnight. Those economies are diversifying and trying to move away from reliance on one-crop, but it is difficult to do that overnight. In the interim, a degree of protection is necessary. It is right that we should be concerned about weaker and poorer nations, and not allow free trade and multinational corporations,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0783">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
especially big American companies, to ride roughshod over the interests of smaller, fragile economies, which are trying to develop. I hope that the Government will continue to support such smaller nations.<br><br>
Helping countries to develop their economies, giving a degree of protection, providing aid as and when necessary and helping with investment will ultimately increase the living standards and self-sufficiency of those countries. Such countries will therefore not become impoverished in future, and will not require the aid that we constantly have to provide. Helping countries to reach living standards that are comparable to our own should be the real aim. I am confident that the Government will continue to try to pursue that objective. I look forward to my hon. Friend the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p>11.57 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), I question whether it is more cost-effective to disburse so much of Her Majesty's Government's aid effort through the European Union. It seems to be more a political than a practical judgment. In terms of practical politics, it is much easier for Parliament to monitor the disbursement of aid nationally. It could modify such an aid programme, suggest which parts of the aid budget should be changed, which should be eliminated, which increased and so on. We feel impotent when we receive huge dossiers from Brussels. All we can do is scratch the surface. To be candid, it is a charade. It is a futile exercise, but we do our best, with willingness and commitment.<br><br>
On the issue of our aid programme, one cannot avoid wondering whether in 1998, when more than £4 billion was disbursed as the United Kingdom's net contribution to the European Union, and in 1999, when £2.5 billion was disbursed, some of those moneys could not have better been used in augmenting Britain's national aid effort where it is most needed. We all confront those issues, but we shy away from them, year on year. The dossier lands on our desk, and we do our best.<br><br>
As I serve on the Council of Europe and have a personal interest, I shall focus on the TACIS programme, the way in which it is used to develop countries that regained their independence from the Soviet Union, and how democracy is being enhanced by development that is continuing apace. I shall start with a country that has not been mentioned, and which is the most difficult case. The agreement was signed, but it was more or less stillborn because of subsequent adverse political changes. Belarus is rarely mentioned, although it is at the heart of Europe—it is next to the Baltic states and a neighbour of Russia. Its leader, President Lukashenko, has profoundly anti-democratic ambitions. Not long ago, the European Union had to withdraw five ambassadors. There is no significant TACIS effort in Belarus, apart from some work in nuclear safety and in education. Attempts have also been made to encourage the media, although I imagine that that is a difficult task and an uphill struggle in Belarus, where the media are tightly controlled. Will it be possible to expand the European Union's aid work in Belarus in a fashion that will result in positive political developments? I doubt it, but I should be grateful if the Minister would report on the situation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
We had a long debate at our previous sitting on relations between the European Union and the Ukraine, and I shall not rehearse all the arguments. Like Belarus, the Ukraine is of key strategic importance to Europe. Economic reform in the Ukraine has been faltering, and there have been allegations of crony capitalism and the misapplication of aid donations. Many western investments appear to have been misapplied in the Ukraine, which is profoundly regrettable. Poverty is pretty endemic in the Ukraine, which is a huge state, just as it is in Belarus.<br><br>
The Chernobyl reactor was due to be closed by the end of the year—a memorandum of understanding to that effect was released by the Group of Seven. What progress has been made in that regard? Are TACIS funds being used and, if so, in what way? A progress report would be welcome. Much optimism has been invested in the re-election of President Kuchma, although there are continuing political difficulties. I gather that the Parliament in Kiev is hardly functioning. Where does the TACIS programme stand? The TACIS office in Kiev has been moved to Tbilisi in Georgia. The Caucasus is a hotbed of potential conflict, and conflicts have broken out in, for example, Chechnya.<br><br>
Delegates from the Council of Europe in Strasbourg convey to me the message that democracy in Georgia is welcome. However, Russia has its ambitions in the region. I believe that Russian troops have not been withdrawn from Georgia on time, although they should have been and were from the Baltic states. The TACIS programme in Georgia, and in the other newly independent states is directed at development and technical advancement and at enhancing the democratisation process.<br><br>
Although we have had an interesting debate, I wish that we could debate only one issue at each sitting. It would have been much more fruitful if, for example, we had spent all morning discussing TACIS. I welcome the Minister's candour and the open way in which he dealt with Committee members. I look forward to his response.</span></p>
<p>12.4 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always interesting giving a speech after only 20 minutes of sleep—I shall probably break into French.<br><br>
I cannot forebear to say that this is the first Committee that I have attended at which both the spokesmen for the opposition parties failed to ask where the relevant documents were, although they knew that they would speak, and both of them left well before the end of the debate. I congratulate the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood on being the only Opposition Member who has sufficient interest to stay and hear what is said.<br><br>
I want to focus on a specific issue that was raised by myself and a number of other hon. Members in an early-day motion—the issue of how a rapid reaction force might be established by the European Union or other international bodies to provide disaster relief. It is common ground among all those observing the present situation that we have been here before and that, every
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0784">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
time there is a major disaster, the world says "Good heavens, that's a terrible thing. What can we do about it?" Each time we resolve that next time we will be better prepared, but not much happens.<br><br>
One suggestion that has been made from time to time by, among others, the Liberal Democrat spokesman is that a standing rapid reaction force be established, which could be deployed as required if a disaster occurred. The problem with that is that it would be difficult to gain acceptance for a sufficiently large force, which could be deployable at any time in any part of the globe, but would stand idle for the rest of the year, waiting for a disaster to happen. Although it might be a good investment in the long run, it is unlikely that the funding would be available.<br><br>
I want to suggest an alternative, which is based on a constituency interest. My constituency contains the national headquarters of the Territorial reserve deployment for the United Kingdom at the Chetwynd barracks. The model used there seems relevant. In each area likely to be affected by a natural disaster—for instance, southern Africa or the Indian sub-continent—it would be possible to provide aid to countries to maintain helicopters, engineering teams and other groups that would be useful not only in a crisis but on an everyday basis. They would be part of the South African, Malawian, Zambian defence forces and would be supported by the developed world on the understanding that, were a catastrophe to occur, they would be immediately made available to help in the relief effort.<br><br>
In addition, small standing mobilisation headquarters would keep track of the available facilities, arrange for joint training exercises and stand prepared to mobilise units from the different countries involved when an emergency arose. We have the expertise and the software for that, and I commend the scheme to the Minister as a model to take forward.</span></p>
<p>12.9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to reply to an interesting debate. I think that the points of order that hon. Members raised at the start of our sitting were something of a smokescreen to hide their difficulties. I was about to say "inadequacies", but I am too much of a gentleman to say that. I do not want to comment further on that, except to thank you, Mrs. Michie, for the exemplary way in which you dealt with the points of order and have conducted our proceedings. I am sure that my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, who has gallantly and valiantly stayed with us, concur.<br><br>
When we published our White Paper on international development it was the first White Paper published by a British Government for more than 20 years—an astonishing thing in itself. It highlighted the central role that this country can play in poverty eradication. We believe that the European Community, as the second largest multinational donor, can and should make a vital contribution to meeting our international development targets.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
I want to deal here with the question raised by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. He is a thoughtful Member of the House and has been with us for a long time. We have had discussions of this kind before and I respect his view, although it is different to mine. The hon. Gentleman's point, which my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North also raised, related to multilateral assistance versus bilateral assistance. We believe that there are potential advantages and, increasingly, actual advantages to be gained from multilateral assistance.<br><br>
First, in the case of the European Union, multilateral assistance taps into funds from other European countries that may not have as good a track record as bilateral donors as we do. We can influence the way in which that global fund is spent. Secondly, the European Union leads on trade matters, as my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North said. As the link between trade and development assistance is so vital, multilateral assistance would mean greater co-operation and coherence between trade and development. Thirdly, multilateral assistance increases the reach of our bilateral funds in countries where we are not able to have bilateral programmes. I know that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood is particularly interested in Latin America. I am often asked about programmes in Latin American countries where we do not have a programme, such as Cuba. I point to the European Union programmes there, which we are part funding. That reach is not available with our bilateral programmes. In principle, if we can do more multilaterally, not just through the European Union but through the United Nations and its agencies, the World bank and the regional development banks, we can contribute effectively not only to poverty eradication and development assistance but to greater cooperation between countries.<br><br>
We published the institutional strategy paper on working with the European Union—again a first for a British Government—which contained the 18 points. We have taken significant steps forward in relation to that. The hon. Member for Amersham said that she did not want warm words. The words that we have put to the European Commission have been fairly strong. Both Ministers and officials—dedicated, effective, efficient officials, who have been working hard on this issue—have been arguing our agenda of greater efficiency and poverty eradication for the almost three years that we have been in office, and I pay tribute to them. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have also taken up the cudgels at a political level when that has been necessary, and I think that we have achieved something. I do not want to go over everything that I said earlier, but the simplification of the Commission has been considerable. When we had five Commissioners, we used to tear our hair out at the complicated way in which development assistance was dealt with; we are now down to two Commissioners—Chris Patten and Paul Nielson. That is a step in the right direction.<br><br>
A good example of positive engagement in Europe is the Lomé convention, which my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North mentioned. It has been successfully negotiated, with much improved provision for development and trade co-operation for the ACP
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0785">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
countries. I shall give my hon. Friend some examples. First, there is to be duty-free access to the European Union for all the least developed and poorest countries in the world. Secondly, free trade areas will be agreed with the ACP countries that wish it. There will be a long transition period of up to 23 years, with the European Union lowering our tariffs first. Thirdly, we shall tackle the technical barriers to market access of the kind mentioned by my hon. Friend. In those three areas, there have been improvements in respect of Lome. Again, they were achieved through multilateral discussions between the 15 European countries and the 71 ACP countries. Of course, matters are not perfect, but there has been a huge step forward. In terms of a constructive working relationship with Europe, the Lome convention has proved effective.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood suggested that each debate should be confined to a single issue. I could not agree more, having spent hours mugging up on all six papers and anticipating hundreds of questions. Most of those questions have not been asked, but in saying that, I do not want to encourage Committee members to ask more.<br><br>
The debate has concentrated on humanitarian aid, and we have sought improvements in that regard. A recent evaluation of humanitarian operations has confirmed an improvement in ECHO'S performance in recent years, but I shall repeat my constant refrain that there remains room for improvement. The Commission is listening, taking note and responding, which is a great improvement on the previous Commission's attitude. Staff training and personnel development are much more structured, and we are seconding British-trained personnel to the Commission.<br><br>
We believe the new TACIS regulation to be a great improvement. As I said, we took the opportunity presented by these negotiations to get across our views, and we pursued a clear strategy with determination. I should again pay tribute to our officials, whose achievement was significant. Although they had political backing, it was they who did the work and argued the case for improvements to the TACIS regulation, which is now more focused. Partner countries can choose the main programme priorities, about which there will be much closer discussion between the Commission and member states. Moreover, the new procedures will speed up implementation. In that regard, there have been significant improvements.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood asked a question relating to Belarus. In 1997, the General Affairs Council concluded that only humanitarian and pro-democracy aid should be given to Belarus. In the current climate, we support that view as, I suspect, does the hon. Gentleman, given his remarks. I have visited the Ukraine twice in the past three years, and I agree with some of his comments on the lack of reform and the lack of progress. I spoke to the Ukraine's deputy prime minister and foreign minister during one of those visits, and we are encouraging change.<br><br>
In response to the hon. Gentleman's question on Chernobyl, the British Government have pledged £10.5 million towards what is described as the Chernobyl
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
shelter fund. The Commission has pledged £62.5 million, and we shall contribute about 16 per cent. of that sum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being most helpful. Given the moneys pledged by the United Kingdom and the European Union, will it be possible to decommission Chernobyl's reactors by the end of this year?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that the European Union and other concerned parties are discussing the closure of Chernobyl with the Ukraine Government. Of course, our own know-how fund has assisted with their energy needs, and I recently met the head of British Energy, who has been advising them in that regard. They have given a commitment to close Chernobyl by the end of this year, provided that an assurance is given that their energy needs will be met in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the previous meeting of the Committee, which a Minister from the Foreign Office attended, I referred to future energy needs in Ukraine being supplied without building more nuclear power stations. Has that been discussed? Ukraine has access to natural gas and it would be better if non-nuclear sources of energy could be developed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure, but I shall discuss the matter with my colleagues and those in the Foreign Office.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe raised an interesting point about the current discussions on the rapid reaction force and we must take account of his experience. I am not sure that this is the correct forum in which to do so, but we must discuss his suggestions. I am a former member of the Territorial Army and, although many people find it difficult to believe, I can strip a Bren gun and even put it together again, but I am not sure that that would be helpful to the rapid reaction force.<br><br>
The floods in Mozambique are creating tremendous anguish for all and Britain has responded faster than almost any other country, but we could have responded even more quickly. We are willing to examine how we can react more quickly and co-ordinate our response better and my hon. Friend's suggestions will be taken into account.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said that much of his experience of TACIS came from his membership of the Council of Europe. As a former delegate to the Council of Europe, I pay tribute to its excellent work on a range of issues, not least human rights. Many countries are seeking accession to the European Union and if they first work with us in the Council of Europe, that helps them through the difficult transition period.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, who speaks for the Opposition, said that there was general unease on the Government Benches. We have no unease about the European Community's work, but we are anxious to make it as effective as possible and that is what we are doing. We believe in European co-operation and we want the Commission to be as effective as possible. Those who believe in poverty eradication and an end to world poverty want the Community's development assistance programme to be even more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0786">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
