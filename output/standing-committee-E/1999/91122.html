	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>World Trade Organisation Millennium Round</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Trade (Mr. Richard Caborn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Roe, for taking this matter seriously and allowing us to have this debate. I should explain that I am not used to the procedure in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although most people are well informed about next week's round of negotiations in Seattle, it will be useful to update the Committee so that it is au fait with what is going on. The Government believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to move towards trade liberalisation, open markets and the removal of trade barriers. That is the object of the exercise. We want to expand globally the technological age to create more jobs and opportunities, in particular in the developing world. It is important to support Mike Moore, Director General of the World Trade Organisation, who has emphasised that the organisation should be open and rules based, with a distinct procedure that is accepted and followed by all its 134 members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from newspaper articles and representations that a number of non-governmental organisations are critical of the WTO's role and the move towards trade liberalisation. They are worried about the effects that that will have on labour and the environment. I give an absolute assurance that our approach to the WTO is the same as our approach to other organisations in the international arena. In our negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, led by the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, and strongly supported by the Secretary of State for International Development, Clare Short, we aim to lift and restructure the debt burden that is placed on developing countries so that they can become a more effective part of the family of trading nations. Our approach to the European Union-South Africa trade agreement is also important because it shows our commitment to the liberalisation of trade. Managing that liberalisation is an important development in the globalisation of trade. We also have a significant role in the EU to move forward the comprehensive agenda that we hope will evolve in Seattle. We want to ensure that we free up trade, and that capacity building and facilitation of developing countries is taken seriously so that they are equal partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a major part of our work has taken place within the EU, some of us were in South Africa last week with the Commonwealth to build the bridges that are necessary to address the concerns and fears that developing countries have as they move into the next round of the WTO negotiations in Seattle. Our connections in the Commonwealth have helped us to allay those fears and to show that we are genuine partners in our efforts to liberalise world trade through the WTO, which we believe could benefit
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
developing countries. We also have connections with the United States which has found it difficult to accept a comprehensive round of negotiations in Seattle. Nevertheless, we shall make strong representations. On every international front—the United Kingdom's relationship with the United States, with the Commonwealth and with the EU—we played a positive and significant role in drawing up a comprehensive agenda to be followed at Seattle that will address the concerns and fears of all the countries to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a political will, not only to set a comprehensive agenda but to deliver that agenda within three years. That target is achievable. We do not want such lengthy procrastination as followed the Uruguay round. We want to ensure that decisions are made—as they should be—within three years and we want to bring certainty to trading patterns around the world. Such a political will should exist in Seattle, and it should continue so that the timetable may be concluded in three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the World Trade Organisation—probably one of the newer organisations in the international arena—to be taken seriously, it must address the trade issues within a reasonable period. If it does that, it may be given the credibility to stand alongside the World bank, the International Monetary Fund and the other international institutions that facilitate orderly conduct in the global marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not keen on what has happened today in Geneva regarding bureaucrats. There will be much for politicians to sign at Seattle—probably more than there would have been had there been greater agreement at Geneva. However, we can proceed effectively next week in Seattle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be sure of the process as well as the substance. Some rules must be strengthened and modernised and the organisation must be strongly based on rules. It must also have a dispute procedure that is respected by all of its 134 members. With that, it can stand alongside those other international institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased to note the strong possibility of China becoming a full member of the WTO. We hope that the deal between the United States and China on market access will pave the way for a sound deal between the EU and China. We can now proceed with that deal, and we hope that we can finish it rapidly so that we may welcome China to the WTO. That is important and, as everyone knows, the United Kingdom has supported China's entry on the right terms. Significant progress has been made and we hope that China will become the 135th member of the WTO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Several hon. Members rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have until 5.30 pm for questions to the Minister. I remind members of the Committee that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all hon. Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton and Honiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first apologise to you, Mrs. Roe, and to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0835">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Committee for my not having been in Committee when the Minister opened his remarks? I was delayed in another meeting and came here as quickly as I could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister's evaluation of the unfinished business from the Uruguay round, especially the commitment to liberalisation in the textile and clothing industry? Is that unfinished business a priority for the new talks that are about to begin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pre-empt what will happen in Seattle—we have said that we want a comprehensive round. You are right, Mrs. Browning: there is unfinished business regarding textiles and other matters. We do not want the unpicking of agreements already put to bed under the Uruguay round. There is more work to be done on the operation of decisions made at Uruguay and on the procedures for implementing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall ensure that those areas are dealt with in the Seattle round. There are concerns and fears, especially in relation to the developing world, that must be addressed. Some of the decisions that were taken in the light of the Uruguay round, which have not been implemented in the way that they should have been, must be revisited. I stress that the implementation of those decisions—to which, I believe, the reference to unfinished business relates—is different from the actual decisions that were made at Uruguay, which we believe should now be carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his statement to the Committee. What detailed proposals does he have to assess the unfinished business in respect of concerns about environmental issues? How can he be sure that he can measure how we achieve sustainability as a result of the round that is just about to start in Seattle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must be clear about what sort of animal the WTO is. It is a world trade organisation. Its purpose is not to resolve all the ills of the world. It must, however, have a relationship with other organisations, whether it be the IMF, the World bank, or the United Nations Environment Programme, which deals globally with the whole question of the environment. The development of multilateral environmental agreements is very important, and, where necessary, those agreements should relate to the rules of the WTO. The discussions must include consideration of those rules, as well as their relationship to multilateral environmental agreements. At the moment, there are about 200 multilateral environmental agreements, of which at least 20 incorporate trade-related issues. It is in all our interests—whether at Kyoto or Montreal—that those agreements are linked to the WTO and that there is an understanding, but neither takes precedence. It is all about the sustainability of our environment, which we put at the top of our agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several codes for assessing the environment have been internationally agreed, and we expect those codes to be used. It is in everyone's interests to ensure that the environment and our resources are treated in the most sustainable way. That is the intention, and it would be far better if there were a proper relationship
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
between those who have responsibility for the environment and the WTO. We must ensure that the two are compatible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are there any aspects of the work of the WTO in the next three years on which Britain will stand on its own and not take the EU position? In other words, what areas can we, the United Kingdom, negotiate, and what decisions are we bound by, as members of the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will stand corrected on this, but my understanding is that we are now in a position of agreement with the EU. We exerted considerable influence on the final outcome in the EU in several areas, including the environment and labour issues. Also, Agenda 2000, which is based on the Uruguay round, deals with agriculture, and we have moved a considerable way towards ensuring that agriculture is on the agenda for Seattle in a positive way. There is no major area on which we depart from the European position, as it stands. I can hear Mr. Jack mumbling in the background, and if he wants to ask me a supplementary question, I am sure that you will allow him to do so, Mrs. Roe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many social practices that we, in this country, would consider unacceptable, such as child labour, but linking reform in such areas to trade often looks to a third world country a little like protectionism. How do the Government intend to balance the desire for reform with the desire not to cause any detrimental effect to third world industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is important and is one of the areas of concern that has emerged in relation to the ILO core labour standards and the WTO. I return to the point that I made earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley). The WTO is not a vehicle for the resolution of all the ills of the world. It is a trading organisation that is its job. However, it considers other matters, including labour. After the Singapore round, developing countries are extremely concerned about the possibility of labour going into the WTO remit, and, as part of a strong rules-based organisation, leading, as you rightly say, to the use of labour standards as a technical barrier to trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned Britain's international links, and our relationship with the EU and the Commonwealth gives us a unique position to sound out feeling in the developing world. As my colleague Clare Short stated the other day, that is not to say that we condone child labour, but neither can the matter be resolved by being stuck into the WTO remit. We believe that child labour and other such practices should be tackled by trying to ensure that countries develop and obtain sustainable economies that enable them to trade themselves out of their present circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the bigger picture, the IMF has removed $100 billion of debt from the least developed countries, and has undertaken the rescheduling of debt and, in some cases, total debt forgiveness. The liberation of money used to service such debts should enable developing countries to invest in their real economies. The Government have stated that the least developed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0836">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
countries should have tariff-free access to the developed world market within the three-year lifetime of the agreement, and we have argued that view in the EU. We believe that such restructuring, involving scaling down debts, debt forgiveness and tariff-free access to markets for the least developed countries, is the best way of addressing problems such as child labour. I think that 48 of the least developed countries will benefit from such measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A forum should be established to enable us to move towards better understanding. We are suggesting to the EU the establishment of a joint WTO/ILO Standing Working Forum, and we hope that the proposal is on the Seattle agenda. Such an arrangement would facilitate bridge building outside the WTO and address problems with which such countries are geniunely concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that he should not use the word "you". He should address his remarks through the Chairman, and should not call hon. Members by name. He must refer to them instead through their constituencies and as hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for arriving a little late. My question follows that of the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack). Will the Minister spell out more concretely what concessions the UK made in reaching a common Community position on agriculture? There is a clear difference in tone between the Community position and the recent, forcefully liberal statement made by the Department of Trade and Industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the best of my knowledge, there were no concessions. We are trying to ensure that the WTO can take on agriculture. We have a clear commitment on Uruguay and have set out our long-term aims. We have stated that we will be negotiating on the basis of Article 20 of the WTO Agriculture Agreement, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"negotiation will be part of an ongoing process of fundamental reform, with the long-term objective of substantial, progressive support and protection."</p></blockquote>
The EU is serious about participating in this process and conclusions adopted at the Agricultural Council on 27 September recognise that. It is also clear that we have to take account of non-trade concerns such as the environmental and social roles of agriculture, but we believe that this must be done through targeted measures which do not distort trade. We have a clear position that is consistent with the decisions taken in the EU and with what the WTO laid out in the Uruguay round on the reform of agriculture. Clearly, there will be difficulties in the post-Seattle round of discussions, especially when we get the comprehensive agenda, but they need to be tackled and our position is consistent. There is no difference at this stage and both Labour and Conservative parties in the United Kingdom have always been in favour of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the continuing removal of price support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Geraldine Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morecambe and Lunesdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have received several representations from
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
constituents, Church organisations in my constituency and various bodies concerned that negotiations may have an adverse effect on poorer countries. I would like an assurance that that will not be the case and that Britain will make representations, within Europe and wherever possible, to ensure that that does not happen. Can the Minister also explain some of the positive benefits to the developing countries that these negotiations may have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, absolutely. To some extent, we are talking about the credibility of the World Trade Organisation and how we handle these negotiations. The United Kingdom has been in the forefront in ensuring that the EU position is very clear: although we believe that it is in the best interests of developing countries to be part of the trading nations, and want to bring them in, that change needs management. That is why we spoke earlier about what we have done at the IMF. We have also made proposals for capacity building in developing countries, to ensure that they have the skills to negotiate in Geneva and can apply them in their own countries and in the global marketplace. We have put about £10 million into a fund to enable the developing countries to play their full part in the international negotiations. The WTO must revisit its responsibilities for capacity building and development to make it easier and less bureaucratic for the developing countries. That would be in everyone's interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are putting in place a series of measures to facilitate developing countries in capacity building and proper engagement. In respect of their wider economic circumstances, when debt relief is needed we will be doing that too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1997, there was a high-level WTO meeting on relief for other countries, which put trade-related technical assistance in an integrated framework, and that is coming through. Some refinements are needed: such assistance should be targeted much more on the needs of individual countries, which it is not at present. If it were in place, it would facilitate the ability of developing countries to manage change more effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne McIntosh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement, especially in respect of opening up markets and liberalising trade globally. Does he agree that there is a danger of France, and, to a lesser extent, the United States, having a hidden agenda? In the case of France, it is already visible. France will hold presidential elections at about the time the millennium round is starting. It will take over the presidency of the EU in the second half of next year and seems to be set on a collision course with the Government's view, as set out by the Minister, about what they hope to achieve from the millennium round. In my view, the Government should be able to reduce subsidies across the board, especially in the western hemisphere countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States has a similar hidden agenda. Both France and the United States are displaying protectionist and regressive tendencies in what is meant to be a trade-liberalisation round. What safeguards can the Government give us now and during the progress of the millennium round that the

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
United Kingdom will not cave in to this hidden agenda but see through the smokescreens, push trade liberalisation and put an end to any form of protectionism by France or the United States?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has every right to express those concerns. In principle, we are trying to mitigate those worst circumstances by calling for a comprehensive round. If we achieve a comprehensive round, we can discuss all matters during the next two to three years. Presidential elections will occur during that period, but I understand and acknowledge the political significance of what has been said. The reassurance that I can give is that negotiation on behalf of the EU takes place via the Commission. The General Affairs Council will meet, but it will advise the Commission, which will have competence for negotiation in the WTO. We now have a common position for Seattle, which is to go for a comprehensive round: Agenda 2000. As I said, the competence to negotiate now lies with the Commission. It would be difficult for any country significantly to break away from the agreed position, although that is not to say that there will not be a lot of hard bargaining on details post-Seattle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the United States of America has been trying to limit the Seattle agenda. We hope that, given the strong representations that the United Kingdom has made, the United States will broaden its horizons and agree that a comprehensive round would be significant not only for the USA but for the developing world. In that sense, it is early days—we are in the run-up to Seattle and will see what happens there. However, we will ensure that the United Kingdom's position—that we should have a comprehensive round—will be put as forcefully as possible, together with the safeguards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my right hon. Friend the Minister recognise the concern that Britain appears to be a brake on the European Union's willingness to raise the issue of animal welfare in the WTO? In September, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food stated in a consultation document that the United Kingdom was considering that as one issue that might be raised, and the European Union has in fact decided to do so. Will he confirm that we support the need to examine ways to ensure that European Union decisions on animal welfare are not undermined by the process and production methods limitations of the World Trade Organisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, we have pushed the issue of animal welfare. One difficulty is that, unlike in relation to the International Labour Organisation or the environment, there is no internationally agreed standard. The EU has been pushing for that issue to be on the agenda for the next WTO round, with a view to changing the rules to take account of farm animal welfare policy. In June, the Agriculture Council and the Commission made a joint declaration calling for the international acknowledgement of animal welfare rules to be a key point in the EU negotiating brief for the WTO. That declaration was repeated in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Council's conclusions, agreed on 27 September. So the United Kingdom strongly supports the further improvement of farm animal welfare standards in the EU, and has backed calls to include animal welfare standards in the new round of trade negotiations. That will be the EU position at Seattle, but it would be wrong to say that we are in a strong position, because the EU is in a clear minority—as I think that my hon. Friend knows. However, we will push that position consistently, and we have unanimity in the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One fall-back measure that we could consider is the whole question of labelling. Such areas can be explored in side negotiations, but we want animal welfare to be included in the comprehensive agenda. I believe that that is possible and that animal welfare is clearly part of the WTO's remit because article 20 covers human, plant and animal health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following that question, will the Minister expand his comments beyond animal welfare—important though that is—to other matters that will affect trade in food products, including, for example, residues of veterinary medicines and substances such as growth promoters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know of the United States' desire to see USA beef available for sale in the European Union. I understand that the British Government supported the USA in its wish to export its hormone-treated beef here, but as a result of the EU's resistance to that, the USA has, in reprisal, raised tariffs against certain sectors. Ironically, one of the sectors that is particularly affected in the United Kingdom is the decorative packaging industry, which now faces undue tariff barriers from the USA as a result of the negotiating position between the USA and the EU. What representations has the Minister made to the United States and to colleagues in the EU to ensure that UK companies and industries are not subject to those unnecessary tariffs, which have resulted from the tension that exists between the USA and the EU in respect of hormone-treated beef?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the best of my knowledge, the UK has stood against the ban on the products to which the hon. Lady referred. That is because WTO rules on food safety allow us to impose trade restrictions on the grounds of protecting human, animal and plant health, provided that that is done on a sound scientific basis, and we have said consistently that in regard to US hormone-treated beef, that scientific basis is not there. That is why we were in a minority of one on the three occasions when the issue came before the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue has been on-going for 10 years or more, so it has spanned both Conservative and Labour Administrations. However, the UK's position has been consistent. We believe that the WTO has a responsibility with regard to restrictions imposed for reasons of human, animal and plant health, providing that there is a scientific basis. However, we also believe that there was no such scientific basis for hormone-treated beef, which is why we voted against the EU position and why we were exempted by both the US and the Canadians from their restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0838">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The UK's position is clear: we support the WTO's position. We believe that there needs to be support for animal, human and plant health—that is right—but that such provisions cannot be applied willy-nilly or used as a technical barrier to trade; the scientific base must be there. We believe that in the case of hormone-treated beef, such a base was not proven, and that remains our position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the position that the Minister has explained, but I should be grateful if he would address the rest of my question. Why, despite the fact that the UK Government supported the USA's position on this issue, are UK companies—particularly those in the decorative packaging industry now subject to USA reprisals against the EU in the form of unnecessary tariff levels? What representations has the Minister made to the USA and the EU on behalf of the UK decorative packaging industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made strong representations. Two different areas are involved, which are being mixed up: beef hormones, which I have discussed, and bananas, which is the subject of the retaliatory action that has been taken by the US that affects the packaging industry. We have been trying to find a solution to that problem, and I hope that the matter can be brought quickly to a conclusion. Last Monday, the matter arose when I was at the General Affairs Council in Brussels, and I have met a number of those involved in the banana packaging industry. We have put pressure on the European Union to find a solution that is acceptable to the US and does not necessarily involve returning to the procedures of the world trade organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned our shared experience with the Commonwealth. In previous rounds, we have at least kept a weather eye on the interests of the Commonwealth and even, on some occasions, tried directly to extend those interests. Given that on this occasion we will be speaking through the European Union, how will the Commonwealth be represented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The desires and objectives of the Commonwealth coincide with those of the European Union. The Commonwealth is a unique organisation in that it represents a range of countries from the least developed to the most developed. Its other unique attribute is that it is the only international organisation that has countries in each of the trading blocs—Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation, the Southern Africa Development Co-ordination Conference and the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example. One can go round the globe and find only one bloc—Mercosur in Latin America—that does not involve a Commonwealth country. That is because it is a party to the Cairns group, and the Commonwealth is thus involved indirectly. When I was in Johannesburg last week, it was interesting to talk to my colleagues from New Zealand and Australia, who are members of the Cairns group. They took a rather bullish attitude—to put it mildly—to the agricultural situation. We were able to open a dialogue with them and with Ministers such as my very
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
good friend Alec Erwin, South Africa's Minister of Trade and Industry. The challenge has been to facilitate a dialogue with countries that are represented in nearly every trading bloc around the world. The dialogue that we have set up will enable us to address the comprehensive agenda and influence the issues of the developing world, as well as those of the developed world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What steps has the Minister taken to quantify the overall benefits to the British economy of the new round of trade liberalisation? As there are so many pressure groups, both self-interested and idealistic, campaigning against liberalisation, it would be helpful to set out those benefits. Have the Government undertaken that exercise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that we have undertaken a specific exercise, although we monitor various areas. I understand that the EU is considering the potential benefits of a comprehensive round for the global economy, as well as the economies of the EU. We are still at the pre-negotiation stage of setting a comprehensive agenda for Seattle next week. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman precise details now, but I shall write to him about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that secrecy is one of the main complaints against the WTO? Would it be a good idea to de-restrict many of the documents that flow from the WTO, other than under exceptional circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The WTO's rules must be modernised in a number of areas, and transparency will be crucial to establishing the credibility that it will need to gain the confidence of the 134 member countries. Although the dispute procedure has, by and large, done a good job, it could also be modernised and improved. The procedure must provide certainty and credibility for all members, and it must be even-handed. It is important that the smallest of the 134 countries does not feel overawed by the biggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister announced at the beginning of his remarks that the round was likely to take three years, and, a moment ago, counselled the Committee that an agenda had not yet been agreed. Has he consulted the Leader of the House to ensure that there will be opportunities, in Government time, for Parliament to be informed about the progress of such discussions and to debate them at each stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The round might take two rather than three years, so it would be presumptuous of the Government to plan for three years. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has already been in contact with the Leader of the House to ensure that we report from Seattle at the earliest opportunity so that we can be questioned. After Seattle, we should have a reasonable idea of what the agenda will be and what timetable will be pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the right hon. Gentleman that not only Parliament but civil society will be kept informed. This deal is not merely for business per se; it is for the consumer, whether in the United Kingdom, Europe or beyond. We want to provide transparency and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0839">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
openness, and be available for cross-examination. I have been in my current job for three months, and I have already had four meetings with the NGOs, on my own or with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, in the run-up to Seattle. I have also had meetings with Church groups and other bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a good principle that consumers should be entitled to information about how the things that they buy are produced. Such information would include the environmental impact of the method of production, and the social background to production. What plans does the Minister have to ensure that agreements are reached on eco-labelling and the other labelling initiatives, which will provide consumers with such information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the consumer should be informed about what he or she buys, and labelling would contribute to that. Labelling also enables the consumer to keep a discerning eye on animal welfare or the environment. We hope that it will be on the agenda for discussion, as it is an important part of informing the consumer. One of the criticisms that has been lodged with the WTO, probably with justification, is that it has been seen to be more on the side of the producer than the consumer. It is important that the WTO should integrate such concerns into its practices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Minister's opening statement, he mentioned the concerns of NGOs. He will know, through correspondence, that the Oxford Oxfam Group and the Oxford branch of the World Development Movement have asked me to bring their concerns to his attention. One of those concerns is that the WTO is a rich man's club—it would be men—which makes rules that exclude, or do not give sufficient consideration to, developing countries. The multilateral agreement on investment is given as an example of that. How will the approach of the EU and of the United Kingdom differ from the failed negotiations that took place on the multilateral agreement on investment, with regard to investment issues in the WTO?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the issues are moved out of the rich man's club of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and into the WTO is significant. The 134 members of the WTO will discuss them. We believe that the discussions will be much more limited in terms of objectives on investment. However, it is an area of opportunity that should not be missed in this round of negotiations. If one is to facilitate trade, one of the components of that process can be investment. We want to ensure that such investment is within the rules base of the WTO, and that criteria can be laid down so that some of the worst aspects mentioned by Oxfam and other organisations can be removed. We want that to be on the agenda for discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal difference between the multilateral agreement on investment and what we are now trying to achieve is that we want to establish an organisation in which 134 countries must agree—not just a rich man's club such as the OECD, towards which much criticism has been directed. We believe that that is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
significant difference and that it ought to be on the agenda of a comprehensive round of talks. The process ought to be seen as bottom-up, rather than top-down, and one in which ownership of the agreements is sound and can be arrived at with certainty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister expand on the point that he made earlier in response to a question about labelling, in this instance relating to animal welfare? Does he agree that technical barriers to trade, especially in regard to labelling and packaging, are an impediment to trade? The trend in western European countries is for the consumer to want much more detail in labelling, especially of food products. Even if global agreement is reached over greater transparency and better labelling, will not the labelling be only as good as the enforcement used to ensure its accuracy? Anyone can write anything on a label, and the further away the consumer is from the point of production, the more difficult it is for him or her to rely on the accuracy of that labelling. What stance will the EU take at the WTO talks to ensure that accurate labelling of food products can be relied on by consumers on the other side of the world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Lady said, and I take on board her concerns. I have no doubt that that issue will form part of the negotiations. We are not going into the details of those negotiations; we are simply trying to set a comprehensive agenda along the basic principles involved. We believe that labelling can be a force for good, so long as it is applied in a proper, transparent and honest way. I take note of what she said, and we shall make sure that that forms part of our discussions in Seattle. If there is not such honesty in labelling, the issue could become subject to a dispute procedure, depending on whether it is in the rules or whether it is a voluntary agreement. Discussions are taking place about that. I do not want to get into doing something that I have accused other countries of doing by negotiating before we have set the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to make it clear that we shall not allow labelling to be used as another form of protectionism, which is a concern that some people have expressed. All these points will have to be examined, and we must ensure that they are taken up when the negotiations begin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in saying that the French tried to have the European Union exclude cultural trade, such as for example, film, music and audio-visual material, from this round of talks. Will the Minister confirm that the European Union position is that such trade should not be excluded? Will he also tell us what the British position is? I should have thought that Britain's economy would benefit considerably from freer trade in cultural material.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The relevant principle is based on the post-Uruguay position. The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"During the forthcoming WTO negotiations the Union"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the European Union—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will ensure, as in the Uruguay Round, that the Community and its Member States maintain the possibility to preserve and develop the capacity to define and implement their cultural and audiovisual policies for the purpose of preserving their cultural diversity."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0840">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I stress that that is based on the Uruguay principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the WTO should be responsible for negotiating trade, and that the ILO should be responsible for labour standards? Is he concerned that he is on a collision course with the Commission and with some Labour Members? The Commission is seeking to set labour standards through the millennium round, which is imperfect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary. We have tried to find a way through a difficult situation. I am sure that the hon. Lady knows that the United States tried to bring into the WTO questions relating to labour, and the core standards regulations, which are negotiated by the ILO. The WTO is a rules-based organisation. It is clear from our contacts that if the United States' efforts were successful, many of the 134 countries, especially the least developed, third-world countries, would walk away. We have tried to deal with some of their real fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one wants the WTO to be respected and to work to ensure that global trade is fair—if it is to achieve the objectives that are contained in its preamble—one should not allow it to handle questions relating to labour. I agree entirely with the hon. Lady. Questions relating to labour should be dealt with by the ILO. However, we must accept that there are links between trade and labour, and between trade and the environment. We must ensure that there are clear divisions of responsibility and clear links between the organisations. The WTO stands alongside the IMF, the World bank, the ILO and the United Nations, through its environmental programme. All those organisations manage parts of the global economy, and their links must be made clear enough for people to understand them. No organisation is more important than any other, and the links must be recognised. The relevant body is called the joint WTO/ILO standing working forum. Its title is a bit of a mouthful, but that is the fashion in international negotiations these days. We believe that it can allay some fears and introduce an effective working relationship between labour and the WTO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A section of the communication from the Commission is entitled "Trade and core labour standards". Page 23 of that document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Community should initially propose to convene a joint WTO/ILO high-level meeting".</p></blockquote>
How quickly will that meeting be convened?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give my hon.

We hope to make progress as quickly as possible, but the matter has to be dealt with in the right way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are Britain's objectives in the services negotiations? How will the Minister respond to the many developing countries that since being required to give access to western banks and insurance companies, demand that their labour services should be given non-discriminatory access here, including the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
right to operate nursing services, information technology contracting, cleaning services and so on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be a matter for negotiation. We want services to be on the agenda because that is important for the United Kingdom. Our service exports in 1997 were £53 billion, second only to the United States, so we have a vested interest. We want a comprehensive round to enable any country to put services on the agenda for negotiation. A comprehensive round is important so that all the issues, including services, can be discussed. The hon. Gentleman's question is valid and the matter will have to be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn to the MAl's successor in the context of the WTO and the substantial changes noted by the Minister. One of the primary criticisms of the MAI was that investors' rights were not being adequately balanced with responsibilities. One possibility is to discuss that in the United Nations conference on trade and development in February 2000. Is it an appropriate way forward for the WTO discussion to include a pointer to the parallel UNCTAD discussions to try to link rights and responsibilities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever may be discussed at UNCTAD, there are new rights and responsibilities that must be embodied in any agreement in the WTO. Assuming that investment is on the comprehensive agenda, UNCTAD could be a forum in which to facilitate that. UNCTAD will meet early in 2000 and is one of the international organisations that could be a forum in which to advance such discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister outline the Government's view on anti-dumping measures? I gather that the Government support the WTO introducing selective anti-dumping measures. What representations have the Government made to the EU, which will negotiate on our behalf, and how might such a rule be used to best effect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right. We have been in the forefront, in the EU and generally, on antidumping. We believe that anti-dumping is being used as a protectionist measure. The rules must be clearly defined and we want to ensure that EU standards on anti-dumping are adopted. There must be rights not only for the producer but for industrial users and consumers. That will be a significant difference for the WTO. All those concerns should be taken into account when considering anti-dumping and the rules must be refined and defined so that it is not used as a technical barrier to trade or as a protectionist measure. We believe that we have persuaded the EU to take a strong position on that and that it is in everyone's interest clearly to define the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it be a principle of the negotiations that any WTO agreements will be technology-neutral in respect of e-commerce and will an agreement to protect intellectual property be discussed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will know that the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights—TRIPs—exists to protect intellectual property in a way that is compatible with the

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
continued liberalisation of the marketplace. We hope that those measures can be strengthened. TRIPs has been criticised by a number of developing countries, and we must readdress the problem to ensure that those fears are allayed and any genuine distortions removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that e-commerce is neutral and can be used to facilitate development. Every step should be taken to ensure that it is available to all and that there is no taxation. It is nothing more than a facilitating tool, but if we are not careful, it could prove retrograde. The Government's position on e-commerce is clear, and we have pushed it hard in respect of the EU and the WTO. As I clearly stated at the General Affairs Council, although there are economic haves and have-nots, we must ensure that there are no information have-nots.

	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 10297/99, a Commission Communication on the European Union approach to the World Trade Organisation Millennium Round; considers that a new comprehensive round of trade negotiations is essential for growth and jobs, for maintaining the momentum of trade liberalisation and counteracting protectionist pressures, for promoting sustainable development and better integrating developing countries into the world trade system; and supports the Government's intention to press for this approach within the EU.—[	<i>Mr. Caborn.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton and Honiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A range of issues has already been covered, but there are others that I should like the Minister to consider, such as the answer that I received on 9 November from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to a written question that related specifically to proposals by APEC—Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation—in respect of accelerated, tariff liberalisation in certain commodities. I asked what analysis had been made of the advantages and disadvantages for the UK in sectors such as chemicals, energy products, environmental products, fish, forests, gems and jewellery, medical and scientific equipment and toys. As the Minister will know, the Secretary of State replied that the matter had been considered in detail at both national and Community level, but that member states concluded that APEC's approach was selective and excluded sectors of importance to the EU. Will the Minister clarify the matter by providing the information that I originally sought?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider chemicals, which is an important industry in this country. If the UK Government deemed it advantageous to the UK chemical industry to proceed and to lobby on its behalf for accelerated liberalisation with APEC countries, the process could usefully be employed in negotiations with the EU to seek a fast-track solution. I am not aware of the Minister's analysis of those sectors because that information was not given in the reply to my written question. He has said that the Government have focused on securing agreement to an agenda, rather than looking at detailed negotiation, but the Secretary of State's answer makes it clear that a detailed analysis of each sector has been made. In tabling my written
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
question, I was seeking to evaluate the way in which the analysis was conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the list is comprehensive and necessarily involves a lot of detailed work, but, given that the work has already been carried out, I ask the Minister, again to make that analysis available to me. Clearly, the matter has been considered by the UK Government and at Community level, and a joint decision has been taken that the APEC proposal is not necessarily a priority at the WTO talks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister expand on his remarks to the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) about e-commerce? We are focusing on that both nationally and internationally—a Bill has its Second Reading in the House next week and a directive is under discussion in the EU. Web trading in particular is part of a global marketplace in which consumers purchase goods and services from business, and business-to-business transactions are increasingly important. What is the position of the Government and the EU on web trading? What consumers and recipients of goods and services need to know is, will the law of the land of the country of origin of those goods and services prevail, or will the law of the country where the goods and services were purchased take precedence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware of the confusion in the Council of Ministers involving the former Minister of State in the Lord Chancellor's Department, who is now Secretary of State for Defence. It was agreed that the consumer law that should apply should be the law of the country in which the goods and services were purchased, rather than the law in the originating country. If the Minister intends to use the WTO talks to take that policy to the global marketplace, it would reassure us to know that the Government's policy is clear on the law as it pertains to the purchase and provision of goods and services through the web. What representations will be made, bearing in mind the fact that this matter has yet to be concluded in the EU, where key decisions are still to be made, and given the timeliness of the WTO talks, which ideally will consider what will happen in a global marketplace?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the general issue of how the WTO interacts with what are broadly called ethical issues. We have been told that the WTO will not allow trade restrictions that are based on process and production methods, and that has an impact on labour, environmental and animal welfare standards. For example, it is not compatible with WTO regulations to rule out imports that are produced by child labour. I am aware of the argument that we might want to allow child labour because of conditions in the country of origin, but a restriction on goods produced by child labour would not be acceptable. Although we could ban the sale of all chairs, which we would not want to do, we could not ban the sale of chairs made by child labour. In the same way, we could not impose environmental restrictions that did not alter the product. In theory, we could ban all grapes but we could not ban grapes that were produced in a certain way. Most people seem to think that it is not possible to restrict access to food
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0842">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
on the basis of whether it is genetically modified or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for animal welfare, two EU policies have been abandoned because of WTO rules: the ban on furs caught by leg-hold traps and the restrictions on cosmetic tests using animals. In both cases, the European Commission came to the view that we would not survive a WTO challenge. Another case will arise next year, because the European Union is seeking to phase out sow stalls. Again, there is considerable nervousness in farming circles that pig producers outside the EU will still be able to import pork from sow stall meat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those three areas have in common a genuine non-protectionist ethical concern, which may be more widespread in one market than another, reflecting genuine cultural differences. The problem is that such ethical concerns nearly always focus on process and production methods. None of us object to the products themselves—most of us happily eat pork, sit on chairs, use cotton and so on. We welcome the import of all those products, but we have legitimate concerns about how they are produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's useful briefing and the Government documents that have been published in recent months describe various ways in which the problem may be attacked. It is interesting to note that they are distinct for the three areas. The International Labour Organisation deals with labour standards. It is a fully-fledged world organisation that can set standards, subject to consent, under well-established procedures. For such problems, the question is only how the WTO and the ILO reconcile their decisions: whether one is subject to the other and, if not, how they co-ordinate. The EU has made the eminently sensible proposal of a joint working party to resolve such problems; the only question at issue is whether such a working party would have a reasonable chance of success, or whether it would be in danger of turning into a talking shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position for environmental issues is less clear-cut. There is no world environment organisation. A previous head of the WTO has suggested that such a body should be set up. Most of us feel that that would be a useful step forward, but we must recognise that such things take a long time. By the time such a body could be set up and producing useful conventions, most of us in this Room would probably have retired—I exempt one or two young faces. We are therefore forced to rely on the multilateral environmental agreements. The question is how multilateral environmental agreements can work together with the World Trade Organisation. That is more difficult, because we do not have a standing body like the ILO to look after the environment, but it is not impossible. We hope that where an environmental agreement has been reached by general consensus, the WTO will accept its consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the hon. Gentleman's argument with care. Various official papers that touch on what he has just been describing propose the concept of sustainability. Has he given
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
any thought to the difficulty of defining in objective terms how a particular activity would be deemed to be sustainable, and so form part of the rule-based system that the WTO wants to follow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for pointing that problem out. One difficulty that bedevils that whole area is that it is hard to express an ethical or environmental concern in a way that is objectively provable. If it is not objectively provable, it risks becoming a protectionist measure in disguise. We must accept that any agreements would have to be subject to appeal at an international tribunal, such as we are familiar with from the WTO, which would reject policies that appeared to be protectionist in intent. I shall return to that issue when I discuss labelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, there is labour, for which there is an organisation; the environment, for which there are agreements; and, completing the triad, there is animal welfare, for which there is neither an organisation nor agreements, so the situation is more difficult still. Nevertheless, there is a widespread feeling that where the European Union has a common policy, there is an issue of sovereignty: the EU should be able to sustain a policy on animal welfare without having to scrap it for fear of it being undermined by WTO rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way to deal, with such problems is to have well established agreements at the highest level, so that it is only a matter of co-ordination. At the second level, there needs to be the possibility of some kind of ad hoc relationship between agreements from case to case. At the third level, there should be the possibility of compulsory labelling, and at the fourth and weakest level, there should be the possibility of voluntary labelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To clarify the point about voluntary labelling, lawyers have asked serious questions about whether a voluntary labelling scheme promoted by Government action is legal under WTO rules. To take a trivial example, we are phasing out battery eggs in the European Union. Would it be permissible to have a label stating whether eggs were battery or non-battery? Even if such a system were voluntary, there is a suggestion that it might not be legal, for the reason that right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) gave. One can understand that. It would be possible to devise a labelling scheme that was clearly discriminatory in intent—for example, labels saying "good-quality European product" as opposed to "dubious foreign product" would obviously be discriminatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful and accept that some kind of appeal against labelling processes should be possible. However, the overwhelming majority—including those who are committed to the free trade agenda—would conclude that the process had gone wrong if it were not possible to label goods in a fair way which informed consumers. By that I mean compulsory as well as voluntary labelling. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) talked about the problem of ensuring that labels are accurate, but that is a general problem common to any kind of international trade. If we import pork, for instance, how can we be sure that it is not some other, more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
dubious kind of meat? I believe that the principle has widespread support and that the WTO negotiations would be seen to have failed in an important sense if they did not clarify that non-discriminatory labelling agreements were legal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to take up the point that my right hon. Friend the Minister raised earlier. The wording of article 20 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade could be marginally adjusted so as to be extremely helpful to the European Union. The article states that measures
	<br><blockquote><p>"necessary to protect animal life and health"</p></blockquote>
are permitted. If it were possible to extend that to "animal life or welfare" and to replace "necessary" with "relating to", most of the animal welfare problems to which I have referred and which are not covered by the treaty would be covered. I appreciate that that is an ambitious negotiating goal, but I hope that my right hon. Friend will feel able to put it on his banner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I identify with the broad spirit of the Minister's introduction and the document which, although it contained some weasel words about agriculture, was commendably forthright in identifying with the principles of freedom of trade, the rule of law—which is one of the main achievements of the World Trade Organisation—non-discrimination and the idea of a comprehensive round. I must be in order to get the necessary trade-offs to produce genuine benefit. There is a political problem, however, of which some of us are aware through our postbag. It is that the cosy consensus that existed for many years on freedom of trade is beginning to unravel. It is not particularly strong in this country, but in the United States, much of the far right, which is powerful in Congress, is wholly opposed to the World Trade Organisation, which it sees as a threat to sovereignty. Many of the radical and environmental groups are opposed to the WTO for different reasons, and there is a groundswell of hostility, which we shall have to confront. As has already been said, these negotiations could take three years and much resistance will be encountered. We must address those problems politically. In my correspondence, there are some endlessly repeated myths about international trade, and the Government must take the lead in tackling them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One myth that is constantly repeated as if it were true is that freedom of trade and an open trading system is bad for poor people and bad for the trading system. That is complete nonsense; there is a vast amount of evidence from international organisations, including the United Nations, of the benefits that a more open system would provide to poor people in poor countries. None the less, the litany of comments about how damaging trade can be for the poor is repeated. The Secretary of State for International Development has taken a commendable lead in the matter, which I fully support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A myth that is repeated with even greater conviction is that an open trading system is bad for the environment. Again, a vast amount of work is
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
being done on the subject. The world commission on trade and development in the 1980s argued strongly that an open trading system is fully consistent with sustainability and probably enforces it, because the growth that usually derives from it alleviates poverty, and poverty, more than any other, is the factor that damages the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another myth which is very powerful—I suspect that many of us half believe it, depending on whom we are talking to—is the idea that somehow or other the world trade agenda is driven by big business and multinationals and we must therefore be very suspicious. There are unhealthy influences in international trade negotiations, but most of them operate at national level, especially in the United States. The campaign contribution system has at least partially corrupted the process; and in a European context, much of the influence when dealing with investment rules, for example, is not exerted by the really big companies, which are largely able to look after themselves, but by the small and medium-size companies that need rules and predictability. None the less, the story is endlessly repeated that it is all in the interests of big business and therefore must be regarded with great suspicion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for me and for others to say, "Well, these are myths." They are powerful, many interest groups believe them and so will many voters. We must consider how to deal with the matter, which is partly one of substance. The contribution by the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) was extremely helpful and thoughtful in setting out the problems of ethical trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a more general level, two things must happen: first, the political process should be much more active. It is appalling that the trade round is being launched and this is the only debate in Parliament about it. That is grossly deficient. I suspect not that the Government were trying to keep quiet about it but that they did not think about it because it was not important enough. That is a serious tactical mistake; unless we have a proper debate on the process on the record, the argument goes by default. Since it is a long, protracted process, the Government, in their own interests and in the interests of the European Union's negotiating position, need to be proactive, to keep the matter to the fore and to debate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing that the Government should do—I refer to an earlier question—is to show that there will be real benefits from this process. They cannot just take it for granted and assume that the great and the good who negotiate these matters are all acting in the public interest, although I believe that that is the case. But that needs to be shown. It must be demonstrated that there will be real economic benefits to consumers, to workers and to the economy as a whole. It is dangerous to be complacent. I worked in the office of the late John Smith when he was negotiating at the conclusion of a previous round, the Tokyo round. We were bombarded endlessly with submissions from textile and paper manufacturers to the effect that the GATT agreement should not be signed because it would damage their interests. John Smith asked me to look at the file and to prove to him that there were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0844">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
people who wanted the agreement. After much searching, we found a yellowing paper from a diesel company that thought that a cut in tariffs would be in its interests. It was assumed that the agreement was a good thing—nobody had taken the trouble to demonstrate its benefits. The Government, the EU and the World Trade Organisation must go out and make the case—it cannot simply be assumed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the groups most actively supporting aspects of the new agreement are also among the groups that are critical? Development-oriented groups such as Oxfam feel that it is important for us to open our markets more to goods from the developing world. The snag is that the EU is still publicly perceived as being excessively interested in protecting itself and in shutting out the developing world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. One objective of the round should be to ensure the abolition of the high tariff points that still exist on products mainly of interest to developing countries. Oxfam is concerned about that, and is especially concerned about agriculture. It is shameful that, after all the honeyed words that are poured on South Africa, South African exports are consistently blocked with tariffs and quotas by the EU and by individual developed countries. The hon. Gentleman is right—concerns about development must be to the fore. To give her credit, the Secretary of State for International Development has been forthright on that matter and I support what she has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be debate and benefits must be demonstrated; in addition certain tricky issues must also be addressed, although I do not wish to speak at length on them as they have already been well dealt with. The first is consumer benefits and food safety. We must somehow persuade people that the issue of genetically modified foods and beef hormones is being properly dealt with. Consumers should have genuine choice over what they eat; such choice must be achieved without the creation of additional barriers to trade such as those encountered in France. Striking a balance is difficult; the Government may be right to say that the sanitary and phytosanitary measures agreement incorporates the right balance of measures. Much of the present resistance to trade liberalisation comes from people who feel that they cannot legitimately exercise such consumer choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue concerns problems with production systems, as the hon. Member for Broxtowe said, although the situation is more difficult than the one that he described. The resistance of many developing countries results not only from fears of protectionism but from a justifiable fear that rich countries are trying to impose unaffordable and possibly inappropriate environmental, labour and animal welfare standards. The agenda that he sketched out—especially making labelling possible, making it effective and assuring people that it can happen—seemed to strike the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
I support the WTO round—it is extremely important and of great benefit to our economy and to other economies. I fear the potential for large-scale political resistance; there is too much complacency at political and official levels about how such resistance might be managed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point made by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) about the need for further debate on the subject. I assume that there will be plenty of opportunities to do so, given that, as the Minister has told us, the negotiations will take about three years to conclude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the implied criticism of European Standing Committees—I am a great fan of them. I am willing to bet that the Minister will not receive such an intense hour's grilling on the subject in any other forum in the House. We should not put the European Standing Committee system down too much—all hon. Members are entitled to attend the Committee and air their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make two points. First, I wish the Minister and the Government luck in the negotiations, which will be horrendously complex. Secondly, I should like to point out some of the awful truths that they will have to face during them. Many of our fellow citizens would agree that child labour is a bad thing and that Britain should not enter into trade agreements with countries where it is practised. Many people would like imported goods to have clear labels stating whether child labour was used in their production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The awful truth, however, is that if Britain banned trade with countries where child labour occurs, in many of them the children employed would be left to starve. If we try to change the social fabric of such countries overnight, they will not introduce welfare states or safety nets for people thrown out of work, but merely throw them on to the streets, where they will be destitute. I am by no means arguing for the status quo. The Government must find a way in the negotiations of ensuring that such countries advance, that their social policies develop and that they move towards the abolition of child labour. We cannot, however, insist on that overnight. I do not purport to know how the Government will strike that balance in the negotiations, which is one of the reasons why I wish them well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has discussed sustainability. It is all very well for hon. Members and our fellow citizens to say that Britain should not trade with any country where forests are being cut down. Such suggestions fail to recognise that we cut our forests down 500 years ago. Once upon a time, a person crossing the river next to this Committee Room would have been in Sherwood forest. One could have stayed in Sherwood forest while journeying from here to northern England. We got rid of our forests, which is one of the reasons why we now possess extensive agricultural and industrial land. We look at other countries that are cutting down their forests and say, "Evil people, stop doing it", having done it ourselves. An awful truth that must be recognised is that it will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0845">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
not be possible to insist that free trade should be allowed only to countries that are no longer cutting down forests. A way must be found of ensuring that those countries make sustainable plans, but it must be accepted that they are doing things that they would not be doing in an ideal world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labelling has been mentioned. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made a thoughtful and excellent contribution, in which he spoke about discriminatory labelling. He was right. The Minister said that items are not banned unless there is a sound scientific argument for banning them. However, if one piece of beef in a supermarket has a label stating that it came from cattle treated with hormones, but another piece has a label stating that it was not treated in such a way, what will happen? Whether or not a scientific argument applies, a consumer will obviously not buy the beef from cattle treated with hormones. It is very difficult to impose a non-discriminatory labelling structure. The only way that such labelling can work is through internationally accepted labelling structures, of which the eco-labelling system is an example that the Government might want to pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will have to work on those complex matters, and I do not know how they will resolve them. It is unfortunate that the negotiations are to be held in Seattle. As the hon. Member for Twickenham said, we should try to reassure people that the negotiations are not dominated by the interests of big business. Of all the cities in the world, Seattle is probably the last where such negotiations should be held. The Government will be arguing for free trade in the shadow of the one of the world's biggest and most anti-competitive companies. I would much rather that the negotiations were held elsewhere. That said, if the Government accept certain principles, we could reach an agreement that is acceptable to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the principles should be to encourage growth for all. At all times, the Government must keep at the front of their mind the needs of developing countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another principle should be to try to advance the social policies of trading countries without being too rigid about it and imposing timetables on them. The final principle should be to try to ensure, wherever possible, that consumers are fully informed about where and how materials are produced, without the information programme being discriminatory. Once again, I wish the Government luck. I have no idea how they will balance all those entirely opposed arguments. I look forward to debating the issue in future when the Government can give us further information about their progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will not be the United Kingdom Government who do all that. The Minister made it clear that the United Kingdom contributes only a part of the European Union's negotiating position. Judging from what happened in the last general agreement on tariffs and trade world round, it is not even the EU, but the Commissioner, who is given certain powers to finalise the remaining items on
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
the agenda, as we saw with the oil seed negotiations. There is a lot of sub-contracting of negotiating power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating a European Union document, right at the beginning of the process. As the Minister rightly counsels us, he hopes that by the time the meeting starts in Seattle, we might have some sort of agenda. I recognise that, at this stage, many of the specific items of information that we might like to have are lacking. However, I make no apology for reiterating my point because, if the contributions of other hon. Members are anything to go by—thoughtful and considerate as they have been—as Members of Parliament, we shall receive many representations, especially about ethical, issues. It is imperative that, beyond an initial statement to the House following Seattle, from time to time—and in its own time—the Government must make available opportunities for hon. Members to discuss specific areas, perhaps in a little more detail. As a Back Bencher, one of the problems that I experienced in trying to prepare for the debate was not a shortage, but an ocean of information. On Saturday, I was clicking away on the internet in my lonely office in Lytham. I could have spent the entire weekend looking at the United States website, let alone the WTO website, the European Union website, or the Minister's website. Everyone has a website. The sites are a little like battleships firing their contributions into cyberspace. Many positions are being adopted and it is difficult to tease out some of the themes. I congratulate other hon. Members on their contributions because they have put their finger on some serious and important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to follow up a theme picked up by the hon. Member for Twickenham, who talked about selling the gains and losses, or pros and cons of the negotiations. One of the sad things about the documents that were provided to the Committee for this debate is the explanatory memorandum issued by the Department of Trade and Industry on 11 August. I do not know whether the Department was indulging in some sort of competition for brevity, but it managed to sum up the entire brief in a page and a half—two and a half pages of writing in all. I am looking at the section entitled "Financial Implications". I know that the technicalities of an explanatory memorandum are supposed to state whether the document has any financial impact on the United Kingdom. I suppose that when one sets out an opening negotiating position, as the European Union and the General Affairs Council have done, it might not immediately have an impact, but it is sad that the explanatory memorandum did not take the opportunity to set out in more detail not only the pros and cons, but the agenda of issues that are to be discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The publication entitled "The UK and the World Trade Organisation: an Introduction to the Next Round", which I also perused, is good at laying out the issues in simple terms. However, neither document tries to educate us about where the points of friction will arise, and the explanatory memorandum should have done so. I was left feeling around to try to judge what has been left over from the GATT negotiations.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0846">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
The Minister did not fully respond when he was asked where we are starting from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where are the areas in which it is believed that barriers to trade should be removed? Again, the Commission's document fails to deal with that. Everyone appears to think that it is a jolly good idea to go off to Seattle on 24 November to try to arrange an agenda, but I should have liked to have had an agenda that explains where the problems are. The explanatory memorandum could have been more helpful in that respect. What are the real issues? Where is the friction? Taking the matter further, what would be the economic gains from removing some of the barriers to trade? President Clinton, in a speech that was widely reported on an American website clearly indicated his views about those gains. It is disappointing that the Government made no attempt in the explanatory memorandum to help us to assess the potential difficulties, gains and drawbacks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I prepared for this debate, I was surprised to discover the lack of representations that I, as a Member of Parliament and a member of the Committee, received from outside organisations, with the exception of Compassion in World Farming and one or two others that have been mentioned. No commercial body has bothered to send members of the Committee any information. I am worried that they do not know what is happening. The Minister said that he had been to speak to NGOs and Church groups, but did not say whether he had been involved in the transatlantic business dialogue that seems to be merrily proceeding, according to the European Commission on 29 October. I do not know what that dialogue has been about—perhaps the Minister can enlighten us. While it is good that business is talking, it would also be good if it talked to politicians, because it is important that we are well up to speed on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister—I am sorry if he did not understand the way in which I phrased the question—whether there will be any aspects of the discussions in Seattle, or subsequently, on which Britain will negotiate in its own right, rather than on the basis of whether it agrees or disagrees with the common position. I recall from the previous general agreement on tariffs and trade round, which was the predecessor to the current WTO round, that the United Kingdom could negotiate in its own right on some items on the agenda because they were not the subject of a common position. Matters may have moved on, or I may be wrong, but I would be grateful if he could clarify that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, our discussions have concentrated on the document setting out the common position. Opinion 1/94 from the European Court of Justice, dated 15 November 1994, considers the competency of the Community to negotiate in the context of multilateral agreements on trading goods. That is exactly what the WTO is all about. I was intrigued by a point of detail in the outcome of that consideration. It stated that the Community has sole competence, under article 113 of the treaty, to conclude the multilateral agreements on
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
trading goods. Fascinatingly, it also concluded that the Community and its member states are jointly competent to conclude what are described as TRIPs, which I thought might be points of difficulty. In fact, TRIPs means trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. Will the Minister give us an insight into the meaning of that apparently dual negotiating position? I should like to have a better understanding of whether this will give the United Kingdom Government certain powers or room for manoeuvre in discussing this important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of TRIPS, the following matter was raised by the commission in papers that it produced in May 1999, which further exemplifies its position on this round:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The pursuit of amendments to TRIPS should be undertaken whilst preserving a balance between the interests of all countries as well as between the users and the rightholders."</p></blockquote>
That is interesting. It goes on to set out some key issues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Firstly, issues which were left aside because of lack of consensus at the end of the Uruguay round require further examination."</p></blockquote>
The question of intellectual property is one of the most important in this round because a great deal of concentration is, naturally, focused on physical goods. However, intellectual property—the protection of a good idea—is the seed corn for growth in the 21st century. There is a difference between protecting a good idea and protecting the goods that may flow from it. It would be helpful if the Minister would comment on that. The Commission goes on to point out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the patent area, for example, the two existing systems for filing patent applications ('first-to-file' versus 'first-to-invent') lead to unnecessary burdens for inventors.</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to go into any more detail on that issue, but it gives an example of the type of detail that will be important in protecting intellectual property rights in this area. Similarly, important issues are raised about copyright and the protection of the rights that go with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why I raised those points is that the Minister reminded the Committee that the United States had recently concluded trade agreements with China, which may well be a precursor to China's entry into the WTO. It is interesting that, in the past and perhaps in the present, China has been accused of being one of the world's great mimickers, of pinching other people's good ideas and reproducing them without any kind of input. Will the WTO address the critical comment that has been made in the context of the past activities of the Chinese Government about what appear to be breaches of intellectual property rights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has raised an important point. Under the TRIPS agreement, developing countries have until 2006 to conform. That year is a long way off, given the speed at which new technology is moving. It would be interesting to know whether China is regarded as a developing country. In many so-called developing countries the technology is available, and giving them an extension of six years in which to comply fills me with concern. One can see how this could be manipulated and used
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0847">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
deliberately to avoid compliance, in order to have the freedom of the rights that one would wish to see protected by the TRIPS agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that important point. It illustrates the difficulty for Back Benchers in keeping up with every item of importance. However, for those in an economy that is becoming increasingly dominated by service activities, the question of intellectual property rights is an important one. No doubt the Minister will help us further on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn to a matter raised earlier in our discussion. The hon. Member for Twickenham tiptoed up to it, when he said that many people think that this will be a cosy discussion, and that everyone will simply think that it is a good idea to open up world trade. However, those of us with experience in agriculture know that that will not be the case. I had discussions about a year ago with the Australian Minister of Agriculture and with representatives from New Zealand—as the Minister mentioned earlier, both those countries are members of the Cairns group. New Zealand is zealot-like in having no public subsidy whatever for agriculture, and it will pursue that agenda hard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States—clearly, the world's biggest player on the trade scene—sits somewhere between the European Union, which gives a great deal of subsidy to agriculture, and the Cairns group, which, by and large, is devoid of such support. I want to explore some of those important points in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that, within the European Union, there will be differences of language about what will be involved in the agricultural negotiations. As the Minister will no doubt have been briefed, the financial support provided to European farmers is partly detailed in boxes of different colours. Those blue and green boxes are designed to describe the nature of the help given to agriculture from public funds. In Commission document 10297/99, the question of the defence of the blue box is described using the following language:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main issues under (a) above are: a successful defence of the 'blue box', which will be essential to ensure implementation of CAP reform".</p></blockquote>
The General Affairs Council, however, uses different language. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Union is prepared to negotiate reductions in support provided that, in particular, the concept of 'blue and green' boxes will continue."</p></blockquote>
Even in that sentence there is a real difficulty. The phrase "prepared to negotiate" implies that changes will be made. However, if the concept of the blue and green boxes is to continue, what will there be to negotiate? The Cairns group is diametrically opposed to the European Union's approach, which it regards as dangerous. Given that the boxes represent £3 billion of support for UK agriculture—which, as the Committee knows, is currently experiencing very difficult conditions—that is a point worth emphasising. It would therefore be useful to hear how that aspect of the negotiations is progressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
The General Affairs Council states that the peace clause and the special safeguard clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"have proved to be very useful instruments in the implementation of the Uruguay Round. Similar instruments will be needed in future."</p></blockquote>
During the intervening period between the previous round and this one, however, the United States has introduced a fair farming act, which has begun to reduce public support, directly in relation to aid coupled to the production of food. The act has not moved away from public support entirely—it provides environmental help and help to farmers in difficulty—but it raises issues that should be discussed in this House. I would not blame the Minister if he wanted to avoid a detailed commentary, as this is a detailed and sometimes tedious subject. To farmers and growers, however, it is the difference between having and not having support in the future. Mr. Fischler introduced a third dimension when, in May, he stated that he did not rule out updating some of the blue and green boxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many different views therefore exist on what is the crucial part of the agricultural negotiation. To muddy the waters further, when, under Agenda 2000, it looked as if we were moving towards a reform of agricultural matters—a reduction in the amount of public subsidy available to farmers—the Prime Minister and 14 other leaders agreed, at the Berlin summit, to put money back in to agriculture. I realise that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food tried to liberalise agricultural policy in the European Union, although he and others failed to do so. However, was it not remarkable that, when money and extra milk quotas appeared on the horizon, all the good endeavours of the Italians and others—who are members of the so-called London club, and who have discussed the basis on which milk quotas operate—collapsed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unclear about the degree of agricultural reform that the European Union is prepared to sanction or at least consider in the light of a track record that, frankly, smacks of a lack of real commitment to fundamental reform. It is clear from the relevant papers that the EU sees this area of agriculture as key. In that context, Committee members have rightly referred to the problem posed by science. How will certain scientific differences of opinion be resolved? For example, what will happen when, in the context of this round of negotiations, the United States raises the issue of bovine somatatrophine? We all know that that is a hormone that occurs naturally in milk, but it is given to some animals artificially and some of its by-products are currently banned in Europe. Although such detailed issues will be raised in the negotiations, we are no nearer to resolving them. Where does the European Union stand in this regard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My recollection may be wrong, but when the Select Committee on European Scrutiny discussed the matter, it was agreed that, although there may be a temporary bulge in agricultural supports, the changes will result in a long-term decline in real terms. Is the right hon. Gentleman sure of his facts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am sure of is that the Berlin Summit reversed what was supposed to be a reduction in the amount of money going into the Common
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0848">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Agricultural Policy. What was billed in Agenda 2000 as fundamental reform of the CAP—and which would have led in precisely the direction to which the hon. Gentleman refers—did not happen. However, the important question concerns points of principle. Despite its attempts to decouple payments from production, Europe still has a lot of coupled payments. Whether we like it or not, they will be subject to attack from the United States and others, and, indeed, the Cairns group. We should not become too concerned with amounts of money, but the European Union continues to maintain a variety of supports for the agriculture industry and its associated parts that are persistently questioned by other groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The published literature makes it clear that a good deal of alliance forming is going on. Various people within the World Trade Organisation are getting together and taking particular positions in areas that will be discussed. Will the Minister tell us what alliances he is aware of, and what threats they present to the European Union? Are we involved in any alliances that were formed to achieve particular objectives? Such knowledge might give us a sense of the dynamic of the discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister aware of comments made on 12 November by the American trade adviser, Mr. Siddiqui, during a joint press conference with Dan Glickman, the American agriculture secretary. Mr. Siddiqui pointed out that the United States hopes
	<br><blockquote><p>"to remove … barriers to trade on biotechnology by making"</p></blockquote>
the decision-making mechanism
	<br><blockquote><p>"science-based … transparent and timely".</p></blockquote>
That shows where the threat is coming from. What are we doing to prepare ourselves in this regard? Whether we like it or not, the EU still contributes £4.6 billion to the agriculture sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Export restitution, which involves food and other exports, is valuable to UK food producers if the prices that we pay—or have sustained in the EU—are above world market levels. That plays a crucial role in many key export areas and it helps to make European goods competitive. I suspect that there will be an attack from the Cairns group and the United States in this regard. Does the Minister believe that export restitutions should remain a key part of the EU's negotiating position, or will the United Kingdom push for a further removal? If so, has he conducted studies to determine what effect there would be on the UK's industrial export market?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that the United States' agriculture and trade representatives have held what they in the United States call public listening sessions. I do not want to go into details, but what monitoring exercise did the UK Government conduct to ensure that they remain fully conversant with the positions that our competitors are adopting?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the wider impact of the negotiations in Seattle, I am disappointed that neither the Commission's document nor the Council's document assessed the economic impact of the changes. The Clinton
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Administration referred to a study that they conducted, which found that during the 1970s and 1980s developing countries with open economies grew 4.5 per cent. annually, while those with closed economies grew by only 0.7 per cent. Those are interesting figures, but it would have been helpful to have had more data on the possible economic impact. The United States pointed out that the world's largest exporters command more than $2 trillion in trade each year. It was calculated that since the conclusion of the Uruguay round in 1994, increasing numbers of open markets have helped American exports to grow by much more than $200 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been helpful if the Commission, the Council or the Minister had given us a flavour of the way in which we benefited from the previous round and of what our potential is. If we are to judge the negotiations' success, we need benchmarks by which to establish whether the outcomes from Seattle and from subsequent discussions will make a positive contribution, but we have none: It is sad that we were not furnished with appropriate information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minds of Ministers will be engaged by the many detailed and technical matters that the negotiations will involve. Committee members have already discussed environmental issues and animal welfare issues. Compassion in World Farming was one of the few organisations that sent me a briefing paper before our sitting. I am sure that it would have supported the proposal on labelling, which we discussed earlier. Its document stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We wish the WTO rules to permit a country to distinguish—when drawing up its import regulations—between products on the basis of 	<i>the way in which</i> they have been produced."</p></blockquote>
I thought that Compassion in World Farming and the hon. Member for South Thanet, who mentioned child labour, might have teamed up. If the regime for employing young people was known and if rules could be drawn up within the WTO on what was acceptable, that might be a legitimate way of distinguishing some of those tricky ethical issues. Parliament needs a further opportunity to discuss the matter and to provide our negotiators with guidance on how strongly we feel about some of those important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have liked some indication of where the technical' barriers to trade are. I shall give an interesting example on which the Minister may wish to comment. The TVR car company in Blackpool, which adjoins my constituency, had a market for its cars in Japan. The Japanese seemed to agree with the European method of testing cars for safety and thus accorded TVR cars entry to their market. Suddenly, out of the blue, the Japanese decided that such testing was no longer good enough and that anyone wanting to export cars to Japan would have to test them under the Japanese system. Poor TVR, which is a relatively small company, was suddenly excluded from the Japanese market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the forthcoming round of the WTO consider the equivalent technical barrier of testing procedures, because therein lies a great opportunity? If there were world acknowledgment that when the European Union's procedures for safety testing were satisfactory for us they should be deemed to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0849">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
equally satisfactory for other signatories of the WTO, small companies such as TVR cars would be able to pray in aid of their ability to do business in Japan the fact that their cars accord with our testing procedures. I would have thought that we would have had some commentary on such technical barriers to trade, but none of the papers covers that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to confine myself to important issues and questions, but I could continue for hours—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] If members of the Committee tempt me, I have plenty of questions which I believe you would find in order, Mrs. Roe. If the Committee wants to hear my complete agenda, I shall plough through the remainder. However, I am merciful and I want to draw my comments to a conclusion so that the Minister has the opportunity to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Carry on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will give us the satisfaction of responding to our comments, but as he has tempted me I shall raise another issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are engaged in a dialogue with those who use the services of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. Page xiv of the European Scrutiny Committee's note contains a telling observation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Council also noted that there are a number of other issues, such as those relating to trade defence and other WTO rules and disciplines, which are of particular concern to developing countries."</p></blockquote>
I wondered how our system of export credit guarantees would be regarded in the context of the forthcoming round of discussions. I am aware that we are not unique in providing such underpinning to trade and the risks therein. I was concerned because the ECGD gives cover for non-payment at a rate that would be below that which could be expected in the commercial market if an attempt was made to insure that risk on a normal basis. Cover is not available for some risks, but it is an integral part of trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The biggest exporter of goods from the United Kingdom is the defence industry and the biggest company in that context is British Aerospace, which is in my constituency. It would be useful to know whether any attempt will be made to undermine or alter one of the key ingredients of Britain's export success—our system of export credit guarantees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the other issues that intrigued me was the flavour in all the documents—from the Minister's Department and from the European Union—of an impending deregulatory bonfire and the sense that burdens on trade are all going to disappear. How does that square with the fact that since the Government have been in office they have, according to the Institute of Directors, managed to impose on UK business some £5 billion worth of additional regulatory burden? That seems somewhat at odds with the flavour of the papers produced by the EU. I thought that it was rather rich of the EU to say that it wanted to deregulate. Its social chapter has been a great engine room for regulation and high cost in the context of creating a more competitive world in trade terms. Methinks that the European Union sometimes speaks with forked tongue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is advising the Committee this afternoon that there is a key lesson to be learned from the way in which the European Union has progressed and from what is now being proposed, rather differently, for the global marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the EU, the process has been that of total harmonisation, with all the difficulties that that entails. However, what my right hon. Friend has identified, which I feel comes through in the documents that have been made available to the Committee, is not a policy of harmonisation, but one of mutual recognition. My right hon. Friend gave the extremely good example of the TVR car company in his constituency. If the Government are going to pursue, through WTO talks and their representations in the EU, a proposal for mutual recognition on a global basis—as opposed to the policy of harmonisation, which the EU has adopted—I, for one, would find great encouragement in that change of policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's sage observations on this matter, which, as the discussion shows, is immensely complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the Minister well in his negotiations at the General Affairs Council. The tradition and philosophy of the United Kingdom is to be open minded about trade and to try to persuade others to be likewise. However, as politicians we must be realistic: while there may be winners, there may also be losers and we will have to answer to both those communities. The more opportunity we have to discuss these matters in Parliament, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet mentioned the value of this Committee's work, and I want to add to that. I have been remiss in not attending a European Standing Committee since the general election, but in the previous Parliament I served on a similar Committee, as well as on the European Scrutiny Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee's activities are extremely important. The Minister must answer an hour of questions on a specific topic. It is quite possible for the speeches that follow to be filled with further questions, to which the Minister is prodded to respond. Thus, my right hon. Friend has a very testing session, but it is an important part of our parliamentary process and better than anything that occurs on the Floor of the House. The pity is that there are not more hon. Members here. That might be partly to do with the timing of our sitting. It is being held on a day when no votes are taking place, so some hon. Members who are interested in these matters and who might have participated are not here. Furthermore, there is a foreign affairs debate on the Floor of the House, so many hon. Members who are interested in issues such as the third world may be involved in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wrote to the Chief Whip's Office to complain about that very point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The number would certainly have been slimmer in one respect, because I would not have been here. I had a commitment in my constituency, but I wanted to be here to discover what was going on and to educate myself about the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wanted to emphasise the value of the work of the European Scrutiny Select Committee. It produced a report on European Union documents. If anyone is ever unsure about what they should be doing or where to go to be briefed, a beautiful list of questions is always contained in the Committee's reports, which is designed to stimulate that sort of activity. I always found that, during questions, matters kept arising from the dialectic and debate that were informative, even if one was not up to speed with the issue. It might surprise hon. Members to know that I am not especially up to speed with the issue being debated today, but I have come to learn. Therefore, I am unlikely to make the sort of speech that we have just heard, which was encyclopaedic and contained testing questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Twickenham. He said that he wished to tackle some myths that were being peddled: the myth that free trade hits the poor; the myth that it damages the environment; and the myth that big business benefits from such operations. Some counter myths should also be considered. It is a myth that, in some way, free trade will not hit any poor people at all; that it will not damage the environment; and that big business does not benefit at the expense of the concerns of third world countries and their ability to operate. Unless we strike a balance, we ignore the fact that the state of world trade and the freedoms associated with trade and free enterprise have often led to problems in other nations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ghana is not one of the poorer African countries. It is dependent on cocoa, gold and timber sales, all of which are hit considerably by the terms of trade. That does not mean that investment and trade with the rest of the world is not important to that country. In fact, much of Ghana's energy provision, which has been built up over the years, was built using foreign investment that came from the development of the dams, initiated by Nkrumah, and the hydro-electric facilities. Therefore, trade and other connections are important, but it flies in the face of experience to say that problems do not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many African nations have moved away from command economies, because much was wrong with the way in which they operated, and have moved towards open markets and free trade, but they have been hit considerably by those two avenues. Some poorer nations may find that protections are fruitful as forms of import substitution because the terms of trade are against them. The problem with protectionism is protectionism at the big end—the money end. We must be concerned about trade regulation and the third world in order to overcome problems in the three areas that were mentioned by the hon. Member for Twickenham. I put that down as a marker for future debates, because we have embarked on a long drawn-out process that may be discussed again on the Floor of the House and elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Trade (Mr. Richard Caborn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for their contributions, which have been informative. I accept the points that have been made about how the House is to be kept informed, especially those from hon. Members who have the serious interest in the matter that they have demonstrated this evening. I shall consider whether information can be more effectively targeted, and we shall have further discussions about that. I am mindful of the tremendous amount of information that is out there, particularly on the internet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is genuinely difficult to assess how much information people want. Lobby groups, interest groups and NGOs that rightly promote particular interests should keep the bigger picture in mind when they are debating and lobbying. As I said earlier, the Government have singled out the NGOs as an important group in that respect, and we have had several meetings with them since I became Minister for Trade. We have also had a series of discussions in various parts of the country with business and interest groups other than the NGOs. That represents a wide platform of discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DTI's document about the UK and the WTO has been generally well received by seekers of information. It is a readable document, and several organisations have said that it is the first time that they have understood what the WTO is all about. It is a good idiot's guide to the WTO and has been widely commended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with some of the points raised by hon. Members. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton referred to the early harvest proposed by the APEC group. We are not opposed, on principle, to the early harvest, and I have discussed it with members of APEC, but it must be in the context of the comprehensive round of negotiations. She asked for a detailed analysis of the economic impact. I do not have that information to hand, but I shall write to her about it because it is important that it should be put into the public domain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The round must take account of the needs of e-commerce, and we shall undertake an IT-related check on the dossier when it comes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much detail has been presented to the Committee. We are trying to reach a negotiating position. Many of the answers to questions that have been asked will be provided after the negotiations take place. We have been spending all our time making sure that the comprehensive agenda, in line with the EU submissions to the WTO, is at the centre of the discussions in Seattle. That may appear to be a relatively easy exercise, but I assure hon. Members that it is not. We are still having to push the matter, and shall continue to do so until the start of the Seattle negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put the ethical concerns about production methods and labelling that were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe on the agenda. I agree that real problems are involved in standards, which, as I said, can be approached through the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0851">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
International Labour Organisation. I believe that the United Nations Environment Programme is taking on the international role in dealing with the multilateral environmental agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed difficulties relating to animal welfare, which is now on the EU's agenda, although our views are in a minority in the WTO. We shall consider the various interesting points that were made by Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not advocate a sanctions-based approach to training and labour, but we want to discuss establishing a forum on health concerns. Regulations are already in place to protect human health in the EU. We shall see how far we can get with animal welfare in the WTO, although it is not for the WTO to establish new international standards in that regard. The real danger is that many people think that the WTO is a vehicle to change everything that is wrong, but it is not: it is a trade organisation, and the various linkages are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully agree with the hon. Member for Twickenham, who said that we should be aware of the associated advantages and disadvantages. We have sought to encourage such a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some 20 years ago, I went to the European Parliament as the elected Member for Sheffield, and I sat next to a gentleman called Willy Brandt. At that time, the Brandt report had just come out, and I had interesting discussions with him in 1979 and 1980. I revisited his book when my received my current ministerial position, and I read some cuttings from newspapers from that date, interestingly, 10,000 people demonstrated outside the House of Commons in support of the North-South report. People such as right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) and Olof Palme sat on the Brandt Commission. Twenty years ago, Brandt discussed how to reorganise world trade, and how trade could be used to liberate people in developing and underdeveloped countries. He even said that we should have a rules-based organisation, but he did not go so far as to mention the WTO although he discussed the mobility of international finance. He said at the end of his report that we should offer developing and underdeveloped economies sustainable development rather than aid, because such development offered a better solution to poverty and deprivation. Those approaches still have a part to play. It took us 20 years to get back to where Brandt was in his report. He was absolutely right. Many of the 10,000 who demonstrated outside Parliament are opposing what the WTO is seeking to achieve—the use of trade to redistribute wealth more effectively and to help us to break into the virtuous circle, which involves expanding the global economy and redistributing the wealth more equitably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
During the two and a half years that the Government have been in power, they have sought to deliver a framework of action, which involves our support of relief of debt, rescheduling of debt and debt forgiveness, our ability to set up bilateral negotiations with countries such as South Africa, our approach to the WTO, our efforts in the Commonwealth and through the EU and our bilateral agreement with the United States. All those efforts share one objective, which was discussed by Brandt and mentioned by the hon. Member for Twickenham. We have to remove some of the fears of NGOs and developing countries, including those involving environmental and labour issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could forcefully argue the case for enlightened self-interest—one might refer to a win-win situation and the power for good. We have not put our case across, and we should put to bed some of the many myths that are around. Business and the Churches should examine the issue in a responsible manner, and we should examine what happened in recent history when protectionism was rampant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton was right to point out that there are many relevant statistics out there. For example, there has been 26 per cent. growth in the world's economy since the Uruguay round. Developing countries have benefited, but more could be done. We could analyse the situation sector by sector, and we could establish whether those countries that undertook liberalisation of trade with a sound macro-economic framework gained through wealth creation and whether those that took the protectionist route did not grow. There is much evidence to show that our approach is correct.
