Social Policy Agenda</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities (Ms Tessa Jowell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that all hon. Members look forward to conducting the Committee's business under your chairmanship, Mr Sayeed. I thank you for your agreement to the arrangements that we discussed last night, which I have communicated to the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes), who speaks for the Opposition. I am joined by the Minister for Competitiveness, my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, West and Hessle (Mr. Johnson). The social policy agenda has broad implications across government, and we want to ensure that the Committee is well served by the answers and information that we are able to give.<br><br>
The communication that we are discussing was prepared by the Commission in response to the Lisbon Special Council, which stated that
<br><blockquote><p>the Council will pursue its reflection on the future direction of social policy on the basis of a Commission communication, with a view to reaching agreement on a European Social Agenda at the Nice European Council in December.</p></blockquote>
The communication is therefore a consultation document. It sets out proposals for action by players such as member states, social partners and the Commission itself. Those players are now submitting responses to the communication, which will be collated by the French as the holder of the European Union presidency. In light of the responses, the French will prepare proposals for a social policy action plan. They intend to discuss the draft proposals at the meeting of the Employment and Social Affairs Council on 27 and 28 November before seeking political agreement at the Nice European Council on 7 December. I have explained the background to the process, and I turn now to its status.<br><br>
The consultation document seeks political agreement to the broad approach on social policy. The document does not have a specific legal base, nor does it need one as political agreement is being sought. However, any measures that result from that must have a legal base. A fundamental element of the United Kingdom's negotiating strategy on social policy will therefore be to ensure that proposed actions have a proper treaty base and that if there is no treaty base, there will be no Community action. However, that does not close the door to building on the successful post-Luxembourg experience of an open co-ordination process, which is what has driven the guidelines in the employment report.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
We shall also negotiate to ensure that proposals for action respect member states' subsidiarity. We would therefore strongly resist moves in any direction that appeared to threaten it. We are supported in that by unanimity in such matters as social security and the social protection of workers. Having explained the background and the process and the UK's broad negotiating principles, I turn to our view on the communication itself and what we want from the subsequent action plan.<br><br>
The UK wants to see real progress across the employment, economic and social agenda set by Lisbon. We were powerful advocates of that process and provided strong support to the Portuguese presidency in the development of its proposals. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said at the conclusion of the Lisbon Council, Europe now has the goal of becoming
<br><blockquote><p>the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world capable of economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.</p></blockquote>
The Lisbon Council agreed specific objectives for employment, one of which was to raise the employment rate from an average of 61 per cent. today to as close as possible to 70 per cent. by 2010. It also set the objective of raising within the same time scale the employment rate among women from its present EU average of 50 per cent. to an average of 60 per cent. Lisbon rightly recognised that action on the three fronts of economic reform, social policy modernisation and progress towards full employment must be co-ordinated in order to meet the overall goals.<br><br>
In that context, we welcome the Commission's statement that the social policy agenda
<br><blockquote><p>sets out to ensure the positive and dynamic interaction of economic, employment and social policy and the political agreement to mobilise all key actors to work jointly towards the new strategic goal.</p></blockquote>
The subsequent action plan must likewise recognise the interrelations between social, economic and employment policy. We agree with the Commission that we must modernise the social agenda. The old approach to social policy in Europe was over-regulatory and focused too much on protecting those in work rather than on addressing the needs of those without work. That arrangement risked holding back European economic growth, reducing employment and increasing social exclusion.<br><br>
Lisbon marked the increasing consensus throughout Europe, which recognises the complementality of employment and social policy. That is combined with a clear emerging consensus about the importance of welfare reform in preserving flexibility in the labour markets. Social policy has an important role in promoting stability and maintaining growth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lilley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hitchin and Harpenden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are no interventions during the opening statement.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0938">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We want to see a modernised social policy that plays a productive role in the EU economy and which must strengthen aspects that foster economic growth and raise standards of living. It must meet the challenge of demographic, social and economic changes, especially in respect of an aging population and increased diversity of family structures, which have put pressures on social benefit systems. The social agenda must examine ways of making systems sustainable and inclusive for the future. That rests on expanding the size of the labour market. Finally, we want a social policy that supports the development of a highly-skilled and flexible labour force. Modernisation of the European social model is crucial to bridging the skills divide and making a reality the dynamic knowledge-based economy to which reference was made at Lisbon.<br><br>
We want to achieve a European social model that builds on the UK's approach, in which economic efficiency and social justice go hand in hand. I think that we are in the lead in Europe in building a consensus for such a future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We now have until 11.30 for questions to the Ministers. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. If we keep to that rule, we will ensure that hon. Members have ample opportunity to ask a number of questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hayes <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Holland and The Deepings)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo the welcome that has already been given to you, Mr. Sayeed. In accordance with your guidance, I should like to start with a specific and brief question. Page 25 of the document is critical of the Government's approach. It states that the UK "shows room for improvement" especially in relation to those who are long-term unemployed and trying to get back into the labour market. This reflects the criticism from the Industrial Society in its analysis of the new deal, which I raised with the Minister last week on the Floor of the House. It speaks of the gateway phase of the new deal being seriously underfunded. Why does the Minister think that the Commission is critical of the Government in that respect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Gentleman by saying that we are not debating the employment report, the employment guidelines or the employment recommendations, as he seems to think. We are debating another communication, from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, the subject of which is the social policy agenda. The hon. Gentleman will find no reference to the United Kingdom's employment record on page 25 of that report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend tell us more about how she sees the social protection committee working, who will be on it and what it will be doing? If it makes statements about pensions, as seems to be implied in the documents, will not that have an impact on subsidiarity?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend suggests, the report contains a large number of proposals—more than 20—some of which attract us. However, there are others that we shall want to examine very closely before giving them our support and providing the political agreement that the action programme needs. The social protection committee is very much part of that consideration, although there are well established mechanisms at Commission level for the involvement and consultation of social partners in developing proposals, which are then initiated by the Commission.<br><br>
Secondly, my hon. Friend raised an important point about pensions. On that issue, too, we want to safeguard against any risk of what might be described as competence creep. There is a limited treaty base in relation to three articles relating to pensions, but they focus on protection for migrant workers. They are provisions that we have enthusiastically supported. There are also proposals relating to occupational pensions. However, we are quite clear that the setting of minimum pension levels, as part of the social security system, is a matter for subsidiarity. They are determined by unanimity and we are determined to preserve the responsibility and role of national Governments in that area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have never participated in one of these Committees before, I hope that you will keep me within the rules, Mr. Sayeed. I certainly aim to stay within them, but I do not know what the rules are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will help the right hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The Minister used the word "modernisation", which is a very unclear and imprecise word that is often used to mean whatever one wants it to. She used it in contrast to the concepts of over-regulated and over-expensive systems. Does she, therefore, mean that modernisation is defined as deregulation and cutting social costs? If so, what elements in the document does she find that point in that direction? I have found only one that could conceivably do so, which is a reference to the simplification of health and safety legislation. That would obviously be welcome.<br><br>
However, of the score or more items in annex 2, will the Minister tell us which ones move in the direction of simplification, deregulation and the cutting of social costs? Specifically, will she tell us whether
<br><blockquote><p>developing collective bargaining between social partners</p></blockquote>
is modernisation or retrogression? Similarly, does pursuing
<br><blockquote><p>equality between men and women in all aspects of social life</p></blockquote>
involve modernisation or retrogression? Is the aim to
<br><blockquote><p>complete and codify the Community legislation on working time</p></blockquote>
regulatory or deregulatory?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McNulty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Short questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is all in the document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McNulty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Short questions.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0939">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that it is embarrassing for the Government to have the contents of this document read out. It also mentions an aim to
<br><blockquote><p>support initiatives related to corporate social responsibility and management of change.</p></blockquote>
No previous competence has been held by the Commission in that area. The proposal to
<br><blockquote><p>adopt the proposed directive banning discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation</p></blockquote>
will lead us into a very fraught area, and presumably involve more regulation. The aim to
<br><blockquote><p>promote awareness campaigns to combat racism and xenophobia</p></blockquote>
And establish
<br><blockquote><p>networks of national labour inspectors—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman could ask two separate questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can finish in two sentences and avoid the need for an extra question.<br><br>
A network of national labour inspectors developed to monitor and implement community legislation does not sound deregulatory. Finally, reference is made to
<br><blockquote><p>a communication on the future of social protection…with particular reference to pensions.</p></blockquote>
How are all those factors compatible with deregulation and subsidiarity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of answers to that long question. Modernisation is described as the purpose of the document, but the document does not define it. That is a weakness, and I shall offer a definition of modernisation in this context, which is relevant to the way in which we apply the definition to our domestic agenda.<br><br>
In terms of good social policy, the Lisbon conclusions identified an interaction between promoting high levels of employment and tackling the waste of social exclusion. In this respect, modernisation recognises measures to address social protection, to improve employability and employment opportunities, to make work pay, and to improve the skill levels in the work force and ensure minimum standards at work. It recognises measures to tackle structural obstacles to participation, particularly by ethnic minorities, women, disabled people and older people, all of whom are potential contributors to the EU-wide work force. Their participation is essential if the Lisbon EU-wide employment rate target of 70 per cent. is to be met.<br><br>
Those measures are achieved through a combination of approaches. In our view—my hon. Friend the Minister for Competitiveness will want to contribute to this point—the key is to establish a proper balance between areas in which regulation is essential to achieving the objective, and those relating to Luxembourg and employment policy, which are described in somewhat Euro-waffle terms as the open co-ordination process. It is likely that one outcome of the Stockholm conference will be a parallel process in relation to social exclusion. That would be one example of modernisation of the social policy agenda in order to establish complementarity and support for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
the overarching employment objective, which is key to ensuring that growth across the EU is a sustainable objective.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to legislation to ensure, for example, equality between men and women in the work place, political agreement on the framework directive, and the implementation of antidiscrimination measures in article 13. We supported those measures and negotiated hard to achieve a framework that is consistent with our domestic objectives, but which would deliver minimum standards across Europe. Individual members states may want to improve on those minimum standards, but they are set in the context of a clear recognition that regulation is not the only way to deliver social progress and increased levels of employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed one long question and one consequently long answer. I trust that the rest will be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my right hon. Friend what she thinks is meant by the statement that
<br><blockquote><p>social policies, treated at a national level, must be co-ordinated at a European level</p></blockquote>
and whether she agrees with it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that question. In some circumstances, national social policies should be co-ordinated at an EU-wide level. That does not mean that they should be regulated at an EU-wide level, but there are certainly benefits in co-ordination. For instance, we will not meet the 70 per cent. Lisbon target on employment generally, and the employment of women in particular, without a degree of monitoring of the performance of individual member states in taking the necessary action—through welfare-to-work programmes, making work pay, investment in training and the development of skills—to deliver those policies. Wherever possible, such objectives should be achieved without regulation, but they are part of the broader benefits of learning from the experiences of member states.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the point that was raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) about the difference in the Minister's mind between regulation and modernisation. She believes that the old approach is over-regulatory, while the modern approach is more flexible. That view is not shared by employers. In her answer to my first question, she linked social policies closely to employment. However, none of the employer organisations—such as the Confederation of British Industry and the Federation of Small Businesses—and none of the small and medium- sized companies that have been consulted agree that her approach is desirable, less regulatory and likely to encourage and improve people's employment prospects and fortunes. Why does she think that is?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0940">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is simply wrong. The CBI welcomed the proposal to renew and modernise the European social model and supported the strengthening of the role of active employment policies, modernising social protection systems and increasing the efficacy of policies to combat social exclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The motivation for the document came from the Lisbon Council meeting. I presume that we are debating it today because there will be further discussions at Nice. Is the Minister confident that the document is entirely restricted to discussing forms of political agreement, and that therefore no part of it will be included in the treaty of Nice, or do we need to consider specific parts of it that might end up in the legal framework following Nice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Proposals in the document that might require amendments to the treaty will not be discussed at Nice. They would have to take their place in the process of treaty renegotiation at a subsequent intergovernmental conference. The focus of negotiation at Nice is on preparing the EU for enlargement, which is therefore the focus of amendments to the treaty. The aim of Nice is to reach political agreement. Following the Commission's initiation of any proposals that amount to legislative change, member states would act through the normal channels and there would be the usual scrutiny.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I elaborated at great length a list of the items that appear to be more regulatory and more centralising. As the Minister did not refer to any deregulatory or decentralising items in the appendix, can I take it that there are none?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the right hon. Gentleman's assertion. As with any Commission proposal, no decision about support or adoption would be made in the absence of a full regulatory impact assessment, which would balance the benefits of a proposed measure with its impact on business. We want to be part of a Europe that is creating rather than destroying jobs. That depends on getting the right balance between regulation and other processes identified by the social policy agenda.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darvill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend tell us how other member states have reacted to the proposed social agenda? In particular, what is their reaction to the proposal for a national framework for information and consultation of workers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Alan Johnson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with that specific point on information and consultation, about which a number of countries share our concern. Along with Germany, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark, we believe that the proposal breaches subsidiarity. We also believe that the European works council directive was the proper European dimension for information and consultation and that any further advance would involve the European companies statute, which is based on a European directive. Debate on those matters occurred
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
a couple of weeks ago in Luxembourg and will no doubt happen again in November. We are by no means alone in our concern about the directive on information and consultation. We object not to the aims, but to the means, which breach subsidiarity and interfere with the culture of individual countries in their approach to employment relations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that question, and contrary to the Minister's earlier assertion, the CBI is highly critical. The social agenda is closely linked to employment, in the eyes of the EU at least. Does not the CBI's objection to the additional legislation and its more fundamental objection to the idea of harmonisation across Europe in that respect—the case for such harmonisation having not been made convincingly—mean that it also rejects a large measure of the EU thinking that has gone into the matter? Where does the Minister glean the view that the CBI is broadly supportive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I offer back to hon. Gentleman the words of the CBI? It said:
<br><blockquote><p>The CBI welcomes the Portuguese Presidency's recognition that the European social model needs to be reformed, that social protection systems must be modernised and that education and training systems must be adapted to meet new demand.</p></blockquote>
It went on to state:
<br><blockquote><p>The CBI supports the 3 broad priorities set out for renewing the European social model:
<ul>
<li>— strengthening the role of active employment policies;</li>
<li>— modernising social protection systems;</li>
<li>— increasing the efficacy of policy to combat social exclusion.</li>
</ul></p></blockquote>
The Government accept that view. We are not talking about harmonisation. The CBI would not want harmonisation in these matters and neither do we.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that the UK Government are already well ahead of the game on the document's broad objectives? Are not the new deal, the action team for jobs, our work on disability rights, the national minimum wage and implementation of the social contract part of the thrust of the document? We have adopted these policies and are well ahead of our European partners on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is why the employment rate in the United Kingdom is 74 per cent., whereas in Europe the average is only a little above 60 per cent. That is a tribute to the stable management of the economy, which has given business confidence to invest and resulted in more than 1 million more people in work since May 1997, linked with the drive of welfare to work and labour market programmes such as the new deal, which have brought enormous benefits to my hon. Friend's constituency. That is why we have seen such a reduction in unemployment during the past three years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain the figures given on page 6 of the document? It states that social expenditure in the United States is 24 per cent. of gross domestic product, that it is 26 per cent. in Denmark, but that the United Kingdom's figure is the highest, at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0941">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
27 per cent. Does not that suggest that a move towards harmonisation would lead to our making less social provision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no question, as the right hon. Gentleman tries to suggest, of reducing levels of social protection. Our objective is to provide social protection for those who cannot work, along with minimum standards at work and investment in promoting employability—particularly to extend opportunity to those who are currently inactive in the labour market. There are always problems in making comparisons because of the different elements that make up social protection. I am prepared to write to the right hon. Gentleman setting out the expenditure that is included in those average figures. I, too, was interested in the figures, but they do not elucidate our understanding of the circumstances found in other countries because they are not comparable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darvill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A matter that has concerned me for some time is the age gap, referred to on page 9. The document states that the rate of employment in the 55–65 age group is too low. One contributory factor is age discrimination in advertisements and in employment policies generally. Does my right hon. Friend believe that enough emphasis is placed on that problem, or should we place greater emphasis on it by leading on those policies? I wonder what influence we would have in Europe in trying to improve the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to make it clear that age discrimination legislation on its own will not deliver a substantial increase in the number of older people in work; it has a role, but legislation alone will not result in reducing the number of inactive older people. The UK has the fourth highest employment rate among people over 50 in the European Union, but neither we nor the three member states with a higher rate than ours have age discrimination legislation. However, I know that people have strong views about the potential benefits of legislation to deal with discrimination at the point of recruitment and selection. In that context, and in close discussion with the CBI, we negotiated a tough but ultimately satisfactory deal as part of the framework directive under article 13, which allows member states up to six years to implement measures to tackle age discrimination.<br><br>
We were critical of the proposals, as originally published, on several grounds—perhaps the most important being the legitimacy of age discrimination. It is important to have measures to protect the position of younger people in the labour market as well as measures to increase the likelihood of older people staying in work. We were highly successful in negotiating a framework that is acceptable in the UK, and we will work with the social partners over the period that is allowed for implementation to ensure that a combination of measures—legislation and other labour market policies such as the developed and strengthened new deal for people over 50—achieves the higher rates of employment among older people that we want.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, there is a significant difference between the claimant count—which falls during periods of economic growth, and has, as she rightly pointed out, fallen over recent years—and the number of people who are economically inactive. The number of people who are economically inactive has increased considerably since 1975, but is not reflected in the claimant count. That is especially true in the most depressed areas with the highest unemployment and among the sections of the population that the hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) mentioned when he asked about older people.<br><br>
Why does the Minister think that the document says so little about racial discrimination, although it says a great deal about discrimination in general? Is it, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden suggested, because harmonisation would reduce Britain's degree of protection for racial minorities to a lowest common denominator across Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me again help the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps he is not aware that two months ago, in the Council of Ministers, we reached political agreement on a framework race directive that will deliver minimum standards at work and outlaw discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. We strongly supported that directive, and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is in the process of considering its translation into domestic legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a specific question concerning my constituency. Many fruit farmers had to leave a lot of fruit on their trees this year because they could not get people to pick it—UK citizens simply do not want to do that work, although the rate of pay is quite good. Farmers have therefore developed schemes with the applicant countries of the EU for students to come and stay on their farms during the summer and help to pick the fruit. They need to develop those schemes further if they are to continue to have viable businesses in future. Can my right hon. Friend assure me that the document will not make the administration of such schemes any more difficult than it already is, and that farmers will be able to continue to develop them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any proposal in the document that would put such established programmes at risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When social security Ministers last met as a body—in Dublin, under the Irish presidency—to consider whether there was a need to co-ordinate and harmonise social security policy, they agreed almost unanimously, with only the Commission demurring, that there was no need for any competence at Community level or any process of co-ordination or harmonisation. They agreed that all that is required is that we learn from each other, and that we can learn from each other only as long as we do different things and have the power and capacity at national level to do so. Have social security Ministers met since then to change that view, or is the document the result of the Commission—the only body that disagreed in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0942">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Dublin—agreeing a proposal at a political level, ignoring the expert knowledge of social security Ministers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that the Government's position on social security matters has been clearly stated, and we are determined that such matters will continue to be covered by the unanimity provisions. This document follows the Commission's rule of initiation, and was published by the Commission for consultation among social partners and member states. This morning's debate is part of that consultation process, and what emanates from it will be determined by member states within the decision-making framework, which is set out in the treaty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darvill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On page 11 of the document, paragraph 2.2, entitled "The knowledge-based economy", says:
<br><blockquote><p>Europe lags behind the US in taking up new technologies.</p></blockquote>
What approaches are being adopted at a Europewide level to bridge that gap? How long will it take to catch up and reach a level that is considered satisfactory?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can help by referring to some measures that were dealt with in Lisbon, in addition to social affairs. The Council agreed to a fully liberalised telecoms market and internet access in all schools by 2001, and completion by this year of an e-commerce directive. A number of issues that relate to e-commerce and the gap between Europe and America that are quite separate and not recorded in this document were discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Commission rightly makes great play of the issue of poverty, and talks about its social policies in that context. It defines the poor as those who earn 60 per cent. or less of the average national income, and by that definition Britain is near the bottom of the league table. Indeed, the Commission document makes it clear that only a couple of countries fare worse by that measurement. How has that changed since this Government took office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, after 18 years of the previous Government we inherited an appallingly divided country, in which one in three children were growing up in a workless household. We have set a target of halving the rate of child poverty by 2005, and nearly 1 million children have already been lifted out of poverty. It is a tragic reality that the effects of poverty build up over generations and cannot be reversed in a matter of weeks. I am proud of the progress that our Government have made to date, but there is still a lot more to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Minister's view, should European countries that operate the European social model move towards the British model, should Britain move towards the European model, or should we move towards each other and meet somewhere in the middle?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Long-term unemployment among young people in the UK has declined by 70 per cent. in the past three years, and the number of adults who have been unemployed for more than a year has declined by over 50 per cent. Savings have been made in welfare spending, and increasing numbers of people are moving off benefit and into work. For those reasons, we think that we have struck the right balance. Whenever my hon. Friend the Minister for Competitiveness and I meet our European counterparts, we argue for the strength and benefit of the UK model.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darvill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of Europewide initiatives require funding, and reference is made to the European social fund, the structural fund and so on. Does my right hon. Friend believe that there are adequate funds at European level to advance the programme in the time in which most member countries would expect it to be delivered?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our responsibility is to ensure that the funds, through whichever strand of the programme, go to wherever they are needed most, and that we minimise spending on administration and bureaucracy. We must also ensure that there is only a very short distance between the money going in and the benefit to unemployed people and disadvantaged communities.<br><br>
Yes, I think that existing levels of funding are adequate. The challenge, about which we must be constantly vigilant, is to ensure that European programmes are aligned with our domestic programmes that share the same objectives for the communities that they are intended to benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the Minister's answer to the previous question, I am pleased to hear that she intends to stand resolutely by the British social model and not give an inch. Will she confirm that, if we accept this document, we shall enter into a policy that will involve, as it states on page 7, "co-ordination of social policies", establishing policy guidelines—which I assume means establishing and agreeing guidelines on what our policy will be—and subjecting them to peer group review? Is she saying that we will enter into this process—which, of necessity, needs some compromise—without making any compromises?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The "not give an inch" mentality, as articulated by the right hon. Gentleman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was describing the Minister's attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman may have been describing my attitude, but it was a very good representation of the policy of the previous Government, which saw the United Kingdom pushed to the margins of Europe and regarded as an irritant rather than a force to be considered.<br><br>
Of course we are prepared to discuss, negotiate and be part of a process that will deliver the best for Europe and the best for our national interests. Of course we are prepared to collaborate, co-operate, share information and learn what we can from other member states. That is part of being wholehearted
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0943">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
members of Europe while safeguarding our national interests and ensuring that other member states learn from the successes of the past three years, of which this country can be proud.<br><br>
We are active supporters of the employment guidelines, and the document proposes the adoption of a model of benchmarking, peer review and regular assessment, and the establishment of policy guidelines setting benchmarks, targets and monitoring systems to evaluate progress. I think that that process works. It is serving us well in the context of driving up our employment rate as part of tackling poverty and social exclusion in this country and across Europe. We shall continue to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darvill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a reference on page 19 to the creation of
<br><blockquote><p>a Pensions Forum to address the issue of pensions and mobility with all relevant actors by issuing a communication.</p></blockquote>
Is there any time scale for the setting up of that forum?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the pensions forum has been set up and has representatives from member states' employer and trade union groups from the pensions industry. The focus of its discussion to date has been how barriers to labour mobility arising from the systems of supplementary pensions in member states could be removed or reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are teasing from the Minister something of a paradox. At times, she suggests that we have got it about right. She talks about making steady progress in terms of poverty, although we have not risen up the league table. She talks about the new deal being a great success "despite the Commission's criticisms of it, particularly its criticism of early access to help for the long-term unemployed. Yet the Minister tells us that that is not enough, that we must have Europewide co-ordination, policy guidelines, target setting and monitoring. How much will that cost? Where is the business plan? The Minister and the Government must have come to a notional view of the additional cost of that co-ordination and of those new proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, the hon. Gentleman is somewhat confused about what we are discussing today. We are not here to discuss the employment package, although I would be delighted to accept an invitation to debate that package and the Commission's recommendations. Once again, the Opposition have engaged in the wilful misrepresentation of Government programmes such as the new deal, but the Commission makes no criticism of them. The new deal is increasingly seen as a model, and is being examined with great enthusiasm and interest by other member states. The only other weapon that the hon. Gentleman seeks to deploy is what he knows to be wilfully selective quotation from a recent Industrial Society report on the new deal, which praises its success.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to appear pedantic about the matter, but the Commission says that the UK still shows room for improvement in respect of early access to intensive support for unemployed people,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
particularly for the long-term unemployed. I know that we are not debating the specifics of the employment package, but the Minister has made it clear that, from the EU perspective, the social and the employment agendas are tied. Indeed, she has spoken of the need to expand the labour market and about the close relationship between those agendas and employment prospects. The Commission has made specific criticisms of the Government's approach, and I believe that she should answer them. It is not a matter of debate: it is here in black and white.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the consultation document refers to the modernisation of the social agenda throughout Europe. Yes, the Luxembourg process is part of that; and yes, we and the Commission have a different view. However, we carefully assess the level of help necessary, and the point of intervention, to ensure effective help for individuals and to avoid the deadweight costs of intervention for those who would have found work in any case—another of the Opposition's favourite chants when they sing from that hymn sheet. We are in active debate with the Commission on proposals from the employment guidelines. We accept some of its criticisms—we are equally critical of our performance—but other criticisms we reject because we believe that the Commission is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To put that question into context, how many jobs have been created since the 1997 general election by the Government, following policies broadly in line with the objectives stated in the European documents that we are considering?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right that the proof of the pudding is in the results. Since the election, more than 1 million more people are in work and close to 1 million new jobs have been created—not by the Government but by business, which has had the confidence to expand, and by new industries and new enterprises, all of which has created new jobs. It is a success story of which the UK should be proud. Only the Opposition appear to be talking down the achievement of UK people and business, and they will be judged by that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course the UK should be proud of its success, which was initiated under the previous Government and which the current Government have so far not destroyed. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am trying to be consensual. It was fostered by a UK social model that the current Government inherited from the previous one, who inherited it from the wartime coalition Government and, indeed, the post-war Labour Government. The right hon. Lady will agree on the existence of that UK social model, which has been very successful and is Anglo-Saxon in type. Does she agree that it is different from the continental European social model? In her previous answer, she acknowledged that she is entering into a process that will result in convergence, through negotiation and concessions, with a less successful model. Why does she want to move in the direction of failure?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0944">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not, we will not, and nothing that I have said suggests that we will do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darvill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some areas need general reassessment and others careful reassessment. What are my right hon. Friend's general concerns and where is more careful reassessment needed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of proposals caught my eye. For instance, I am not sure what priority we would attach to the launch of a reflection group on the future of industrial relations. A wide range of proposals have been made, from those on open consultation discussions to those that would almost certainly result in legislation. Having established agreement about an acceptable broad framework that links social policy with measures to tackle social exclusion, to increase employability and, therefore, to raise the employment rate, we will want to make judgments on the specific proposals in the light of their effectiveness in helping us to achieve those objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fairness and in the spirit of generosity that has so far pervaded the Committee, I should like to give the Minister another chance to answer the question about cost. Leaving aside the employment aspects—even though they are implicit in these matters, in my judgment and in that of the EU—what are the costs of the social programme? What are the costs, at least, of target setting, bringing together policy and the harmonisation described by the Minister? There must be additional costs and the Government must have a view on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Evidently, I have not made myself clear. The hon. Gentleman is obviously having difficulties, as he thought this morning that we were discussing a different document. He is at sea in terms of what he would like to believe the CBI said, as opposed to what it actually said.<br><br>
We have a clear process that was adopted by the previous Government and which is rigorously applied by the current one. When specific proposals come forward for potential legislation, they are subjected to a detailed regulatory impact assessment. That enables us to know before we sign up and agree—or not—what the costs will be, both specifically, in terms of impact on industry and benefits, and in terms of cost analysis. The cost of the guidelines is essentially borne in the good administration of policy. We are talking about collecting information that we need and which we should be collecting for domestic purposes. The hon. Gentleman will have to do better than trying to build a case against this framework on a trumped up, spurious allegation about the level of costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her clarity. We now know that these costs will be borne on the basis of information already collected. She seems to be telling us that this process will simply draw together existing information that has been collected by national states and is in the public domain, but will there be a need, as a result of the additional harmonisation and target setting that she described, for additional information to be collected? If so, how will that be done and what additional costs will it involve?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are to achieve the results that we are determined to achieve, it will be necessary to collect further information. For example, I am not satisfied that we have a clear picture across Europe of the level of basic skills such as literacy and numeracy. We inherited from the previous Government a position in which 40 per cent. of new dealers—young people entering the gateway—are without sufficient levels of numeracy and literacy to achieve national vocational qualifications at level 1. We are tackling that. We want to see similar opportunities extended to young people across Europe, and we need the information to assess the extent of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings us to the end of the time allotted for questions.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 9964/00, a European Commission Communication on a European Social Policy Agenda for the next five years; supports the Government's welcome for the Commission's analysis of the challenges facing employment and social policy in the next five years and for the emphasis placed on increasing employability, on combating social exclusion, on promoting entrepreneurship, whilst opposing proposals that impose unnecessary burdensome new legislation particularly upon business, and remaining convinced of the need for proposals to codify, adapt or improve existing legislation or for new legislation to be made clear and workable; and notes the Government's intention to negotiate to this end, and to ensure that the proposals take proper account of the legitimate concerns of employers and the need to raise employment rates across the Community.—[<i>Ms Jowell.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>11.31 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hayes <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Holland and The Deepings)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been revealed during questions that the document is, paradoxically, vague and prescriptive; pious and interfering; woolly and nitpicking—in a way that only European Union documents can be. It makes a number of general assertions, with which few people could disagree, about the need to be fair to all people regardless of gender, the need to encourage modern means of doing business and the need to encourage a degree of social coherence and decency. Those assertions appear to be anodyne, but behind them lies a series of specific proposals that demand of the Government additional work that will ultimately lead not to less regulation, as the Minister suggested, but to more regulation and a more intrusive approach—moreover, at the European level.<br><br>
Our objections are twofold. First, we do not believe we need the additional regulation, and, secondly, it does not need to be harmonised. Even if we were to take the view that we had too little social legislation and needed more laws, more restrictions, more regulation, more bureaucracy and more red tape, why should we necessarily take the view that that should be equal across Europe and applied to all member states regardless of local conditions and needs? The differences in each country's and region's traditions, history, employment base and social make-up necessitates an approach that is flexible and sensitive to those national and local needs.<br><br>
At this stage, the document represents a statement of intent. It is apparently anodyne; it speaks in general terms about co-ordination and consultation with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0945">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
relevant parties. Ultimately, however, the EU sees this as a first step towards further intrusion and regulation. The Minister says—and we must believe her, because we always believe Ministers when they speak in Committee—that she would resist anything that was not in the national interest and stand up to any additional imposition of bureaucracy on our hard-pressed small and medium-sized businesses.<br><br>
However, she would find it hard to do that if other EU states, in setting these demands and targets, required Britain to meet them halfway—to compromise, in the words of my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley). How can one have such combined policies, common approaches and co-ordination without a degree of compromise, and how can one have a degree of compromise without being prepared, at least in part, to sacrifice national interests?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman seriously arguing that European nation states should be able to adopt poor working conditions as a matter of public policy, in order to improve industrial competitiveness? Is he honestly saying that that should be an option for European states?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, nation states and Britain in particular might choose to adopt more regulatory arrangements on working conditions and the labour market. I would not choose to adopt such arrangements as they would, in my judgment, be undesirable. However, if that is the will of the British people as expressed through this sovereign Parliament, then so be it. My right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden drew attention to the fact that there may be some diminution of the protection offered to people in this country. Indeed, I said briefly that I had concerns about racial discrimination, although I shall not focus on them now. When we end up with a lowest common denominator, we also end up with an equality of mediocrity. I do not necessarily argue for less enlightened or liberal laws on these matters, but I think that decisions should be made in this Parliament, on behalf of the British people and with sensitivity to local needs.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) referred to an interesting matter in his constituency. He spoke about the particular employment needs in a sector of his local economy: fruit growing and picking. Like the hon. Gentleman, I represent a constituency that contains a large number of people who are involved in horticulture. He will know that such local sensitivities and needs breed a local tradition. He will also be familiar with the practice of seasonal and part-time work. As he described, immigrant labour is often used at particular times of year, when many people enter the country on short-term work permits, from eastern Europe or wherever else, and fulfil a vital function in supporting the local economy.<br><br>
That is an example of how employment needs differ within a nation, although if one were to visit my old city of Nottingham and advance such an argument, people might look back blankly, unaware of such needs. I ask the Committee to imagine the diversity of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
need across the whole of Europe. Every region will have its own employment circumstances and specific needs for policies that are sensitive, responsive and flexible enough to enable both the employed and the employer to prosper in a spirit of co-operation and fairness and with all the other conditions that the Minister, the hon. Gentleman and I want to foster.<br><br>
Our objection to the document is that it is too woolly and too vague. Perhaps EU documents tend to be drafted in that manner in an attempt to gain agreement. Potentially, however, it is also too prescriptive. The Minister told us that she saw no immediate need for legislation. Perhaps I am misinterpreting her, but I think that when I first asked her about cost she said that she believed that most of the information that would be collected was already available. Later, however, she qualified that statement and said that it would be necessary to collect additional information, although she did not quantify it or offer any cost analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for the New Deal (Ms Tessa Jowell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me make it clear again—I have already done so several times—that we will collect the information that is necessary for supporting our aims and objectives of getting people back to work, off benefit and into jobs and for enabling them to stay in work. We will not collect information merely for the sake of it. Whatever cost has to be expended in order to achieve that is a price worth paying, as it will be getting people off benefit and back to work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Money that is spent on that noble and laudable objective is, of course, money well spent. We all want to assist people back into work but, as I said, the Commission is critical of some aspects of the Government's approach.<br><br>
I asked another question to which I did not receive an answer, on the Government's approach to early access to intensive help for the long-term unemployed. I am not suggesting that all that the Government have done in respect of employment or unemployment is bad and it would be foolish to do so. However, particular criticisms are reflected in the Commission's observations and require specific answers. I argue not with the expenditure of money on the laudable aim of getting people into work, but with the need to monitor, co-ordinate and harmonise that approach at international and European level.<br><br>
If the proposal is simply a question of measuring, monitoring and target setting, I see no reason why it should prove terribly useful to unemployed people in my constituency. It will not help people in Sutton Bridge, Spalding or Holbeach, or fruit growers and potential fruit pickers in the constituency of the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman).<br><br>
If the proposal offers no value, it will not be money well spent. In fact, we do not know how much money will be spent because Committee members have failed to elicit that information from the Minister. If there is more to the proposal than target setting, harmonisation, co-ordination and measurement, one presumes that some legislation and additional regulation will be involved; yet the Minister described

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
regulation and modernisation as though they were opposites. [<i>Interruption.</i>] She shakes her head, but she said that the old approach was excessively regulatory and that the modernised social agenda would free people from regulation.<br><br>
The Minister also said that the Confederation of British Industry applauded and wholeheartedly supported her view and that it is enthusiastic about the European agenda. Perhaps the CBI says one thing one day and something different on another, but I shall give it the benefit of the doubt and assume that it shows at least some degree of consistency. John Cridland, deputy director general of the CBI, said that the proposal
<br><blockquote><p>is effectively giving the signal to harmonise all EU employment legislation.</p></blockquote>
On consultation and the changes anticipated by the EU, the director general himself sees no case for Europe-wide harmonisation of procedures. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>Job security is about being well-trained, not protected in an unreformed and regulated market.</p></blockquote>
Committee members perhaps will be aware of the stark example of small and medium-sized enterprises. Like the big companies that the CBI represents, smaller organisations are filled with trepidation about what they see as a potential source of new regulation, bureaucracy and red tape. If the proposal is no more than that, why are we wasting our time discussing it, and why is the EU wasting its time producing these documents at enormous cost to British and other taxpayers? We need to know how and where the burden will fall, and at what cost to British jobs. What will be the cost to British employers? What will be the increase in overheads to British businesses? Those are the questions that need to be asked and answeredabout this social policy agenda. We can all have grand social visions and great plans and philosophise about the need for greater social coherence and harmony, but we need to measure new regulations, demands and targets in terms of their impact on the British economy and people, and the sovereignty of the British Parliament.<br><br>
I am impressed with the Minister, who said that she would stand up for national interests and rights. However, the other states have a different social agenda from Britain's and I wonder for how long she will stand up for those rights, in the face of a concerted EU campaign to snuff them out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Honestly, those comments owe more to fantasy and creative writing than the document that we are discussing this morning. The hon. Gentleman tried to invoke the spectre of harmonisation, but the document states:
<br><blockquote><p>This new Social Policy Agenda does not seek to harmonise social policies. It seeks to work towards common European objectives and increase co-ordination of social policies in the context of the internal market and the single currency.</p></blockquote>
Let us debate the facts, rather than indulge in the Euro-sceptic fantasies on which the Opposition thrive.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always delighted to be described as both creative and fantastic in the same sentence. I accept that compliment in the spirit in which I am sure it was offered. I do not think that my questions are a Euro-sceptic fantasy. They will be asked throughout the country by businesses and people who want to measure the proposals, many of which deal with laudable objectives.<br><br>
I do not argue with much of the verbiage; indeed, some of the text is so broad, bland, woolly and apparently anodyne that one cannot disagree with it. For instance, one cannot disagree with broad assertions about the need for greater social harmony and social cohesion. In the same way, one cannot argue with the need to enable particular groups to prosper or for a more high-tech, knowledge-driven economy. Those aims are almost a priori, but the assumptions must be translated into their likely effects and demands on the people of Britain, as well as into their costs and the extra regulatory burden that they will produce.<br><br>
We must ask how the need to co-ordinate—let us leave the word "harmonise" aside and be as uncontroversial as possible—will be fulfilled. The Scrutiny Committee asked a specific question about what it meant to say that social policy should be initiated at national level and co-ordinated at European level. Of course, the Minister replied to that question, but I asked a further question about cost because co-ordination at European level surely cannot be cost-free. If it is cost-free, it is likely also to be value-free.<br><br>
I am not convinced by the need for co-ordination, target setting and comparison among member states at EU level. I do not argue that we should not debate such matters in the privacy of our own homes or perhaps in the civilised atmosphere of our clubs. Indeed, they can be discussed anywhere in our constituencies. However, I question seriously the need to discuss such matters at EU level and to compare figures on which, as we have heard from the Minister, no action will be taken as no extra legislative burden will be introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman by mentioning a part of the document on which I happened late last night. Perhaps I should have intervened earlier to do so. The hon. Gentleman thinks that we are debating something else, so we know that he has difficulty in following the text. I should like to help him. I shall give him my copy of the document at the end of the sitting, so that he will know what we were discussing. It states that
<br><blockquote><p>the implementation of this Agenda does not require additional funding but rather implies the re-direction of public expenditure to improve efficiency and investment in people, as agreed at Lisbon and Feira.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always like to get an answer, even when I have had to ask the question four times. I congratulate the Minister on finally answering the question. I mean that in the most generous way possible—I am grateful to her for finally finding her notes. I am clear about what we are discussing: a new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0947">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
social agenda for Europe. I am debating the principle of that agenda and the need for it to exist. My points have been entirely pertinent to the debate.<br><br>
In her own words, the Minister linked the social policy agenda to the employment agenda. The Committee is not debating specific employment suggestions, such as those on works councils or consultative arrangements, because it is not our business to do so. However, as the Minister has repeatedly said, from the EU's perspective, such matters are closely tied, not to say inseparable. All of the points that I have made have been specific and particular to that EU agenda, which I question for two reasons. First, I do not believe that it will not lead to additional regulation and the imposition of further burdens on British people and businesses at a significant cost. Secondly, I do not believe that a case has been made during today's proceedings for the need to co-ordinate—I shall be generous, and avoid the word harmonise—these matters at a European level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Loughton <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Worthing and Shoreham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being late, Mr. Sayeed. I have spent the past 50 minutes stuck on the tube in a tunnel. That gave me some time that I had not anticipated to read a document, and that is entirely the Government's fault. The Minister just pointed out a key section of the document, which is one of those that I had underlined. She referred to the redirection of public expenditure to improve efficiency, not to extra spending. To redirect expenditure means to take from somewhere to give to somewhere else. Has my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and the Deepings (Mr. Hayes) heard her make it clear where that redirection will come from? I would be hard pressed to see how this will not amount to extra expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a useful point. I established at the fourth time of asking—the record may show that it is more than that, but I am again anxious to be generous—that there are no specific proposals for additional costs. However, if, as my hon. Friend suggests, there is to be a redirection of expenditure, it would be interesting to know from where it is being redirected—perhaps health or education or another service that is funded by the Government. I am sure that the Minister will have that information at her fingertips.<br><br>
My argument is, first, that this may lead to the additional regulation that I have tried to warn against in my few brief words to the Committee and, secondly, that a case has not been made for a harmonised approach of Europe-wide target setting. It would be injurious to the national interests not only of Britain, but of all the member states. I speak not only from the British perspective—I would make the same case if I were a Spaniard, an Italian or a German.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to respond to four points. First, will she reassure us about the prospect of the additional regulation and legislation that, as the document makes clear, the EU wants? How does the Minister intend to go about resisting that and what steps has she already taken to clarify the British view?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
Secondly, following the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton), will the Minister explain from what other Government expenditure the additional funds are to be redirected?<br><br>
Thirdly, I want the Minister to assure the Committee that the costs to the country in terms of costs to employers of adopting this social agenda have been worked through, that there is a notional figure on them and that that notional figure has been debated with the relevant agencies, which have offered their views. My discussions with small and medium-sized enterprises and larger employers—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The CBI—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave the Minister the two quotes from the CBI that I have to hand. If it is prepared to speak to her again about its enthusiasm for additional regulation, bureaucracy and red tape—which I doubt—she may wish to bring that information before the House in some way.<br><br>
Finally, will the Minister clarify the results of the consultations to which I referred and bring them to the House in the form of a further enlightening statement on these affairs?</span></p>
<p>11.53 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) is so eloquent that he has tried to conclude his arguments on three occasions and has been called back for an encore each time. That must be the first time that I have ever witnessed that. I congratulate him on being entertaining, if somewhat—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Creative.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. You have presided over this Committee on previous occasions, Mr. Sayeed, and will know that there is often a level of consensus in the Room that would surprise many people. Sometimes the proceedings almost degenerate into—or are elevated into, depending on one's point of view—a love-in. This is not going to be one of those occasions because consensus does not exist today. The Conservative party is certainly being consistent, as it opposed the initiative in the European Parliament. The Liberal Democrats, too, are being consistent, because they abstained in the European Parliament and have not bothered to turn up today. It is time that someone focused on the fact that Liberal Democrats—members of a party that claims to the champion of Europe—do not often attend these important debates and, when they do, have little to say worth listening to.<br><br>
It surprises me that we do not have consensus today. As the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings said, much of what is contained in the documents is motherhood and apple pie stuff. I do not see much from which people would want to be dissociated. In summary, the documents seem to suggest that everyone in Europe would be better off if more people had jobs; that if more of those in work were better paid we would be better off still; and that we should all be working together to achieve those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0948">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
objectives. I see no grounds for disagreeing with those objectives, and I cannot understand the failure to reach consensus.<br><br>
As the Minister said, the documents are an attempt to achieve political agreement. They are not yet proposals; if they became proposals, even I would object to some of them. I should certainly want more comprehensive information about how they would work. They are an attempt to get each member state of the European community working towards a common agenda and formulating firm ideas; only then would national parliaments and the European Union need to act. The Opposition seem to think that such matters will somehow fall into the Chamber and become law overnight—perhaps when the treaty of Nice is signed.<br><br>
I asked how many of the document's proposals would be contained in the treaty of Nice, and the Minister said that no part of it would be included in the treaty negotiations at this stage—although member states may decide at Nice that certain parts of the document should become the subject of legislation and that specific alterations to the treaty should be made. We should not be fearful about that. Indeed, we should welcome it. Working towards such a social agenda would not only improve life for our citizens, but would help Europe to build a highly desirable economic model.<br><br>
I draw the Committee's attention to the graph shown on page 12. It is erroneously entitled "Poverty and employment". The accompanying text makes the mistake of suggesting that the number of people earning less than 60 per cent. of the national average wage is a measure of poverty. It is not a measure of absolute poverty but of relative poverty. It is simply a statement of the disparity in incomes within a nation. It would be quite possible for a wealthy nation to have a low figure on the relative scale of poverty but still to be considered extremely wealthy by the rest of the world. I do not think that we should read too much into that graph. The Opposition would probably disagree with me on principle, but I believe that it is desirable to reduce the disparity between the rich and the poor—not by bringing the rich down, but by bringing the poor up—and the Government are working towards that end.<br><br>
That graph is based on data from 1995. At that time, the United Kingdom was coming out of the third recession—or was it the fourth?—engineered by the Conservatives during their 18 years in power. The graph shows that just before the country moved into the final recession—it was left to the present Government to deal with it—the United Kingdom's employment rate was about 70 per cent., which was quite good relative to some other European nations. However, the disparity between rich and poor was quite distinct. In other words, many people were earning below the national average. I would aspire to Denmark's position on the graph, because it has a lower disparity between rich and poor, but with a high employment rate. That is what the Government are trying to achieve with the minimum income guarantee,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
the working families tax credit and other initiatives to get people back into work such as new deal and action team for jobs. The Government are creating jobs and improving pay and working conditions for the people in those jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am fascinated by that chart, and I share some of the hon. Gentleman's doubts about its accuracy. Does he acknowledge that the figures published before the summer show that the number of people in poverty in this country has risen during the past three years? Does he agree that the position of the United Kingdom, even on that rough chart, would be rather worse if it was based on the latest 1999 figures? To what does the hon. Gentleman ascribe the UK's position on that chart? Are we relatively poor payers in Europe, or is the poverty gap the result of more people being paid more and more people being paid less? How does the hon. Gentleman interpret those figures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me start with the first question. The poverty figures published this summer take no account of the working families tax credit or the other initiatives introduced by the Government. They were based on figures from earlier in the parliamentary cycle. Were those figures to be repeated now, and were those other factors to be taken into account, it would present a far more positive image.<br><br>
The simple point that I am trying to make about the graph is that the Government have in mind a model of what they want to achieve. The Opposition might disagree with them; they may believe in some people becoming extremely wealthy while others manage only to get by. I do not suggest that they want people to work for poverty rates of pay, but they do not put the same emphasis on raising the level of pay for lower-paid people as the Government. That is a clear difference between the parties. The Government's model includes initiatives such as new deal, action team for jobs, the working families tax credit and the minimum income guarantee. That model has been delivering the Government's vision for the social agenda for the past few years, and we intend to continue that job. That is very much in line with the aspirations contained in the documents before us. The documents contain nothing that we should fear.<br><br>
The main thrust of the Opposition's thesis in the European Parliament and of the comments of the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings is that working to that agenda and trying to adopt that sort of model would reduce employment. That is not this country's experience. As we move towards that model for our society, we have created 1 million jobs. The two things are not mutually exclusive. Creating jobs is about creating competitiveness, but it is also about creating the right economic conditions to ensure a skilled work force and to allow industry to flourish. It is about innovation and about harnessing the energies of entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Borrow <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ribble)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, although the Opposition have continued with the rhetoric of opposing better regulations to support workers in their jobs, it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0949">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
significant that, during the three-and-a-bit years since the Government came to office, they have changed their views on the minimum wage—one of the most crucial measures introduced by the Government to uplift the incomes of lower-paid workers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Opposition have become convinced of the merit of the minimum wage, although I remain to be convinced that it is a true Pauline conversion. If the Conservatives were to win the next election, I doubt whether they would allow the national minimum wage to be raised. They have nevertheless accepted that it is here to stay. I cannot envisage anyone now upholding the argument that the Conservatives used to advance—that the national minimum wage would cost jobs. Clearly it has not cost jobs. It has brought people into work as they see the merits of working. With the working families tax credit and child care credit coming along, people are now coming to my surgery to ask how they can access the new benefits. They want to get back into work.<br><br>
Thanks to the new deal and action team for jobs, I see the benefits as my constituents who had given up on work are now going back into it. Having adapted their life style around the welfare system and benefit claims, they had formerly never even thought of work. Some had never had a proper job and believed that their entire existence would be lived as Jack-the-lad, ducking and diving, claiming benefit and finding a little bit on the side. Such people have now been through the environment task force. I spoke to some of my constituents who completed it and their message was that they enjoyed it. They enjoyed the camaraderie of working with other people and of having some extra money in their pockets. They see the benefits of working; even of being part of the establishment. That is what I want. We have changed their mindset—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman ensure that his comments relate to the European document before us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Sayeed. My enthusiasm for the new deal and action team for jobs may have led me astray.<br><br>
The document before us calls for a series of initiatives throughout the European Union that relate closely to our new deal and action team for jobs. It simply calls for other nations to do in their countries what we have tried to do in the past three years in this country. It will create jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am going to be polite and say that the hon. Gentleman has a naïve view of how the European Union works. No one could question the hon. Gentleman's genuine interest in employment. He talks with great eloquence about the glory of work and about his desire to raise people out of poverty. No one on the Committee would disagree with him, but what does that have to do with enforcing a co-ordinated, target-setting and costly approach across Europe? Friendly agreement is one thing, but the document is much more than that—it leads the way for all sorts of additional regulation.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing me to my concluding remarks. We need harmonised action across Europe, so that no single nation can try to take advantage—in the manner suggested by the hon. Gentleman—by introducing poor working practices or low wages to create an unfair competitive advantage. The document effectively says that Europe will not allow a sweatshop mentality and that minimum standards of working conditions, pay and industrial relations will be established across the board. There will be a minimum threshold to ensure that no one nation can compete unfairly. We must move together throughout Europe to create the social model already championed by the present Government with such success. There is nothing to fear in the documents, but there is a great deal to fear if this social agenda does not move forward in the European Union.</span></p>
<p>12.9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) said that, unlike in previous debates, there was no consensus on objectives. In fact, there is consensus on some of the objectives that he spelled out—improving working conditions, getting more people into work, and so forth. There is, however, disagreement about whether the document proposes the right methods or processes to achieve that. I sought answers to four key questions, but received none from the Minister. If I may do her job for her, I will suggest what those answers should be.<br><br>
First, I sought a definition of the use of "modernisation" in the document. Is it—as the Minister's colleagues in the other place, before whom I had to appear yesterday, on this very subject, in the Select Committee—seemed to think, synonymous with deregulation and lower state provision? The Minister said that modernisation is a recognition that measures to address social exclusion, make work pay and improve skills and minimum standards are essential to encourage participation of groups of people who do not at present fully participate in the labour force. Those are objectives, not means, and are compatible with anything. "Modernisation" therefore does not mean a process of deregulation.<br><br>
My second question was whether any measures listed in the document, the annex or elsewhere—apart from the one that I mentioned—involve deregulation or decentralisation. None does—and that is why the Minister was unable to give a clear answer to the question. She had to enter into the higher waffle at which she excels.<br><br>
My third question was whether the process that the document invites us to adopt would involve convergence between the British social model—the Beveridge system developed under successive Governments—and the European social model, which, interestingly, the document takes as unique and comprehensive. It does not acknowledge that there is anything other than the European social model, such as a British or Anglo-Saxon one.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0950">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
The Minister's first answer on whether Britain would be required to move a little towards the European social model was clearly no. However, when I characterised that as our not budging an inch, I set off a Catherine wheel of a response: "Gosh, what a wicked suggestion; only Tories ever said that they would not move an inch and of course we were involved in negotiations, concessions and agreements." In other words, the process would involve some movement towards the European social model. When I put the question again, I got a second no. So we are left a bit confused: two noes, but one emphatic yes. The answer is obviously the emphatic yes.<br><br>
The process, of necessity, involves consensual convergence. That is what it is about. Does anyone seriously imagine that target-setting and disestablishing policy objectives will result in our all agreeing to diverge? Of course not; it will initiate a process of convergence. That may be good or bad, but it is convergence between the British social model, which the Minister rightly says has been extremely successful under previous and present Governments, and the continental model, which has been a comparative failure, generating far fewer jobs and getting far fewer people in the relevant groups into work. We will therefore be made to compromise with failure.<br><br>
The Minister may well say that that does not matter because the document is not legislative, but we are entering a process in good faith, will reach targets in good faith and will agree them, as a result of compromise, in good faith. I am not the greatest admirer of this Labour Government, but it is inconceivable that a Government of this country would in good faith voluntarily commit themselves to those targets and then not meet them, just as it is inconceivable that they would commit themselves to a process of policy guidelines and not follow them.<br><br>
Other countries may not feel so morally obliged, and, not being legally obliged, may not follow the process. Continental countries are often criticised for not implementing measures that they are legislatively bound to implement. We will feel obliged to follow the guidelines, so the fact that such action is voluntary and there is only a moral obligation to take it does not make doing so less binding on this country or affect less the way in which we shall behave. If some countries do not follow the policy guidelines to which they have signed up, but we do, there will be resentment. A ratchet effect may be created, as a result of which everyone will say that such guidelines must be made statutorily obligatory. That often happens. We should know if the Minister has no intention of doing as I have suggested and honouring her word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate is descending into farce. The right hon. Gentleman has no grip on the fact or the reality of the document. He cannot have read it. Earlier, he asked me about the likelihood of regulation, and I answered on the assumption that he had read the document. Even a cursory reading of it would make it clear that what is proposed is broad
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
discussion, consultation and the sharing of information. Yes, there may be proposals for regulation, which we shall consider on their merits, but it is rubbish to suggest that we shall be swept along involuntarily, on a tidal wave of legislation and obligation that we do not support. We will sign up to guidelines that we intend to implement and apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take offence at the suggestion that I have not read the document and do not know what I am talking about. I spent two hours yesterday being questioned about it by a Committee in another place, and it certainly did not reach that conclusion. In fact, it congratulated me on the clarity and persuasiveness of my evidence. The Committee was chaired by a Labour party member.<br><br>
I was quoting word for word from the document, which the Minister says I have not read. She clearly has not read it. I referred to the open policy co-ordination and used the words "establishing policy guidelines", which are to be subject to an evaluation via a peer group review. Does that not mean that policy guidelines will be established? If they are established, will we adhere to them? Will we not be subject to a peer group review of whether we have adhered to them? The answer to all those questions is yes.<br><br>
I have given a clear statement on the contents of the document. Perhaps the right hon. Lady does not read the footnotes and explanations of what she is signing up to. She says that I do not know what I am talking about, but I have been involved in a series of talks and conferences in Germany and France on the very subject. She may not like what I say, but I tend to be invited to more conferences, to write articles in newspapers about the matter and to discuss it on the radio. Countries in Europe are interested in what they regard as the considerable success of the Conservative Government in establishing policies and in persuading the present Prime Minister to endorse our actions. I have become interested in the subject and in the whole concept of a European social agenda, of which the document purports to be part.<br><br>
One of the first conferences at which I spoke was in Germany. It was not organised by the German Government, although Ministers spoke at it, but was sponsored by a large bank and attended by about 300 people. It had the interesting title "A Social Europe—Towards the United States of Europe". It was taken for granted by all those present that the process of establishing a social agenda for the European Community was part of the process of creating a united states of Europe. That may be right or wrong, but I was the only one to question it. A secret ballot afterwards revealed more scepticism about the desirability of that objective than at any previous conference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Get back to the document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We need to know what the document, which the hon. Gentleman is keen to have discussed thoroughly, is leading towards.

<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0951">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
document goes more than a step along the route, but the process of European development is teleological. We need to know where ultimately it is pointing.<br><br>
The justification given at the conference and elsewhere for trying to create a social Europe is as follows. It is argued that creating a single market unleashes forces of competition, which may have economic benefits, but are seen by many working people as a threat to their employment and security. That increases the importance of laws that protect employment and provide social welfare. However, if nation states continue to be the providers of such protection, the population will see Europe as the source of the risk and the nation state as the source of the protection. Consequently, if people are to be persuaded to transfer their loyalty from nation states to European institutions, Europe should become at least in part the provider and originator of employment protection and social support. That is a perfectly coherent and rational explanation of why those who wish to build up European institutions want to transfer responsibility for social policy from nation states to European institutions.<br><br>
The argument continues that the need to build a social Europe has been intensified by the creation of the euro. The American dollar works across a whole continent, encompassing somewhat divergent economies, because the United States has three mechanisms that euroland so far lacks. The first is labour mobility. Far more people move between states in America than move between different departments and Lander in France or Germany. We know that language, culture and other obstacles make it inconceivable that there will be the same degree of labour mobility in Europe as in the United States. The second factor is true wage flexibility. The possibility of wages coming down is inhibited by much of the European social model, and there is no question of undermining that.<br><br>
Those who advocate Europe moving in the direction suggested look to the third factor, which is fiscal transfers—the so-called fiscal federalism between different states via the United States federal budget. When California was plunged into recession at the end of the cold war as the defence industries that were concentrated there were run down, Californians paid less tax to the federal Government. Despite that, they received far more money from the federal Government in transfers in order to aid social security and other expenditures. There was a fiscal transfer from the more prosperous parts of America to the temporarily less prosperous.<br><br>
Advocates of a social Europe want to create a similar system of transfers in Europe to help make the euro work and to consolidate the creation of a single state. That means giving European institutions more responsibility for social security and social protection. Any move to do so would obviously require either new social spending programmes or the harmonisation of national programmes, followed by some co-financing of them.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not this fiscal shift between nations exactly the intention of the European regional development fund and the convergence funds? The previous Government signed up to those and were in favour of them. They shift funds from wealthier nations to poorer nations in Europe to try to create the convergence that he has described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the history is that my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) favoured setting up those funds because he thought that they would offset the imbalance created by the extent of expenditure on agriculture, and that we would be net recipients. It did not work out that way, so they have not turned out to be to our advantage. However, they relate to long-term differences in income, not to cyclical changes between states. At present, Europe takes only about 1.5 per cent. of gross domestic product centrally, whereas the Government's interesting document on the pros and cons of European monetary union points out that no multinational currency grouping has ever worked without a federal budget transferring about 20 per cent. of income between member states.<br><br>
I have described the direction in which the process is heading and is intended to head. I do not suggest that the document is going to achieve anything in one leap. It clearly is not. It does not even spell out the ultimate objective, but even the longest journey starts with a single step. The first step is for the European Union to establish competence in the domain of social policy and to begin the process of harmonisation and centralisation. If we do not intend to proceed in that direction—many hon. Members on both sides of the House see no need for it and have no desire for it—we should not take the step set out in the document, small though it be. The doctrine of acquis communautaire has always meant that once responsibility is transferred to European institutions it is never returned. There has never been an instance of power being returned to member states.<br><br>
The other argument that is given for entering into the process is that it could stop social dumping, to which the hon. Member for South Thanet referred. We need not fear that. The idea that variations in levels of social benefits can result in one country gaining an advantage over another in cost terms is nonsense. We all accept that there are wage differentials between and within member states. There is absolute agreement between member states that it would be absurd folly to try to equalise wages between Portugal and Germany. In free markets, the higher the productivity, the higher the wages. Germany has high productivity and high wages and Portugal, so far, has lower productivity and wages. As productivity in Portugal rises towards the German level, no doubt wages will do likewise. However, to raise wages in Portugal prematurely to the German level would be catastrophic for the Portuguese economy.<br><br>
Wages tend to reflect productivity. The social security benefits that a country decides to provide come from tax—from wages. The amount of take-home pay goes down as benefits go up. That is the so-called social wage deduction. That is all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0952">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
accommodated within market forces and there is no question of Portugal's being able to achieve an overall advantage by reducing or increasing the social wage element in pay packets, and somehow undercutting Germany.<br><br>
However, we could all lose by inhibiting the operation of the marketplace and job creation—by imposing burdens on employers that discourage them from creating new jobs, and thereby bidding up wages and productivity levels in each country. That is what we should be worried about, and should avoid. Unfortunately, far from encouraging deregulation and reducing the obstacles to job and wealth creation, the document intensifies the obstacles, adding to the burden.<br><br>
The final justification given for following the continental social model is that it is supposed to have beneficial economic effects. The document argues that more social provision in the mould of the European social model has beneficial effects; that it creates social cohesion, which contributes to industrial peace and to the tolerance of industrial change, so society gets richer. However, that does not seem to be happening. We have more industrial harmony and fewer disputes than any country in Europe. The most dynamic economy in the western world is that of the United States of America, which is the antithesis of the European social model. The idea that to achieve industrial harmony there must be social consensus, which can come only through the structure of social benefits applied on the continental, Bismarckian model, is refuted by the facts.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will think again about the wisdom of signing up to the document, which has no objective merit. The most recent meeting of Social Security Ministers of which I am aware took place in Dublin. It was unanimous in the belief that there was no case for taking the proposed path, no need for a process of co-ordination or harmonisation of social security benefits and that there was everything to be gained from studying and learning from each other's experience. If one country tries a different kind of benefit, that is fine, but there is no case for establishing policy guidance, targets or a system of peer review to oversee how different countries operate their social security systems.<br><br>
I shall answer the fourth question that I put to the Minister: Social Security Ministers have not met since the Dublin meeting and rescinded their views. If I am wrong, perhaps the Minister will write to me and put me right, saying when and where they met and what were the conclusions. I suspect that I would agree with my former counterparts around the table that there is no need to do as the document proposes. It was imposed by the Commission for the reasons that I have set out—with the long-term objective of transferring responsibilities to a European institution—and agreed by Heads of Government at a European Council because they wanted to be seen to be doing something that, allegedly, would reduce unemployment and lead to greater European integration. We would be foolish
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
to accept the measure on the pretence that it will have no consequences. Words have consequences; the words in the document will have malign consequences.</span></p>
<p>12.32 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet on his eloquent contribution, in which he expressed many of my thoughts. It will not surprise hon. Members to know that I oppose many of the views of Opposition Members.<br><br>
I was pleased to receive the bundle of documents in the recess, so I was able to read them thoroughly. My first thoughts were that they tended to waffle and were written in Eurospeak and, like the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings, I wondered about the cost of producing them. However, on a second reading, taking the wider view, I found considerable merit in them. It would be wrong for the House or the Government to say that there is no social policy agenda in Europe, because there clearly is, and has been for some time, and we must contribute to it.<br><br>
In the single market, there will be pressure from the populations of Europe for development and for improvement in social conditions. Issues will undoubtedly be raised across borders, because countries and businesses trade with each other, and aspirations will be raised. It seems proper that the Commission should issue a political framework document with vision. To that extent, bearing in mind the fact that there will be differences between nations and that subsidiarity is involved, it is right for us to set out our own views and take note of the document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which does the hon. Gentleman believe is more important in that respect, subsidiarity or consistency and equity throughout Europe through harmonisation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darvill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that question requires an answer one way or the other. Whether subsidiarity should always be the main priority is a question that is raised in the Committee from time to time. My idea of the concept is that each decision should be examined and made at the appropriate level. In some cases, such as that of the European working time directive, although decisions are made at a national level, co-ordination is directed from the Commission. That rule can also be considered for other social policies and Europe-wide measures.<br><br>
The motion expresses my views and I am happy to support it. It provides that the Committee takes note of the European Union document and, significantly, refers to
<br><blockquote><p>opposing proposals that impose unnecessary burdensome new legislation particularly upon business, and remaining convinced of the need for proposals to codify.</p></blockquote>
It is for that reason that I am happy with it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings referred to the discrimination aspects, which he felt were rather weak. I disagree. Some positive action has been taken, such as the adoption of the proposed directive banning discrimination in employment on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0953">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, and the adoption and implementation of a proposed action programme to combat discrimination, among other measures.<br><br>
The aspects to which the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings referred are covered in the document. He seemed to argue that if we accepted the proposal we would be accepting a diminution of our existing legislation. I disagree. We can set levels while having Europe-wide minimum levels. That is a proper objective for the Government and the nation. It is right for us to occupy the chair in Europe and influence other countries in that respect. Ultimately, nations themselves will decide.<br><br>
We should aim for a reduction in unemployment. That is a laudable aim, and it is the basis for most of the policy direction. However, a balance is required. We must recognise that overburdening business with regulations affects society generally. That is accepted. It is easy to be critical of regulation and burdens, but regulations often effect important social changes that in the long term we do not want to reverse. The minimum wage is a good example. The more business and society generally understands that social balance, the more it will be accepted. No one likes to have more red tape or increased burdens when new regulations are implemented, but in the longer term there will be an improvement. That is why I believe that Europe is going in the right direction. The Committee should support the document, which I generally welcome.</span></p>
<p>12.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Alan Johnson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say that it is a pleasure to ride shotgun under your chairmanship, Mr. Sayeed. It has been an interesting debate, which has highlighted a clear division that goes beyond the views expressed about this document. As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities said in her opening remarks, the Commission consultation has taken the form of a document, which will feed into the French presidency, for a social policy action plan to be considered at the European Council in Nice in December. There is a division between us—mods versus rockers: laissez faire versus regulation, especially in the employment market.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) has had a virtual monopoly on speaking about the issue at events around Europe. That is probably because his party is almost unique, as it is the only mainstream right-of-centre political party in Europe that takes such an extraordinary view on the document. That view has highlighted the division between us on interference in the labour market.<br><br>
As an example, let us take the unregulated, laissez-faire approach of British Telecom 23 years ago. Before the implementation of equal opportunities legislation, its male employees could not be day telephonists, and its female employees could not be night telephonists. In between the full-time day telephonists going off-duty and the full-time night telephonists coming on duty, there was a twilight shift of part-timers. They
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
were class B members of the union, which certainly sends a message about second-class citizens in the workplace. That shift worked the hours that the full-timers did not want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Anne McIntosh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was a trade union organiser.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly was a trade union leader in that industry at the time. Many other workplaces took a similar approach in an unregulated, inflexible market. That changed as a specific result of equal opportunities legislation. All hon. Members will agree that the dynamism of the market is the best way to produce wealth and growth for our people, but we believe that the dynamism of the market has no social conscience, so there is a role for employment law in ensuring regulation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss McIntosh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the true difference between the Government and us the fact that we would prefer industry to regulate itself, and not be regulated from above? I am referring to the European Union. That is the crux of the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come to the specific points about the document, but there is a clear difference between us, despite the Opposition's small change of tack on the minimum wage. During a debate on a statutory instrument in this Room last year, it became clear that they would exempt small companies and that, under them, the minimum wage could go down as well as up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ivan Henderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A clear example of what we are trying to do to ensure equality of social interest in Europe is the shipping industry. That industry creates problems for all European states. Some shipping companies in some countries exploit labour. There should be a common interest in giving people a fair deal and allowing for a level playing field with other industries. Shipping is an industry in which companies self-regulate, and at has lost seafarers. The Government have now introduced the tonnage tax to provide equal opportunities with other industries in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right and makes an important point about a specific industry. The previous Government's approach was to abolish the wages councils. That made it legal for a hairdresser to be paid less than £2.40 an hour, which did nothing to increase—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the document?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I am identifying the clear difference in approach on the issues across the Committee. The Conservatives are paranoid about anything that looks as if it might interfere with management's right to manage. They do not think about the exploitation of the work force.<br><br>
The document was published after the Lisbon summit, which dealt with several issues that are outside the social model but important to the growth of wealth in the European Union: faster liberalisation in gas, electricity and transport; the reduction in state aids; the financial services action plan, which will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0954">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
implemented by 2005; the small firms charter, which will be developed by the end of the year; a strategy to remove barriers to services in 2000; and the full liberalisation of the telecommunications markets. All those measures will go forward in Europe. The document is about ensuring that we work towards objectives to increase flexibility in a constantly changing workplace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right that the document comes from the Lisbon summit. It translates the commitments made at Lisbon into concrete action. Given that he is describing the translation, will he say whether that concrete action will lead to additional law and regulation and at what cost? The questions posed are simple, but they have not yet been answered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman who represents South Holland cannot see the European case. My right hon. Friend answered the question about cost by quoting from the document, but not the document that the hon. Gentleman thought we were debating when he entered the Room.<br><br>
There is a clear role for action at EU level in promoting the completion of the single market through enhancing labour mobility at European level and preventing the pursuit of unacceptable competitive advantage. Several Labour Members made that point. The European Commission's unique position can also be used to develop comparative studies and to identify and promote best practice across the EU.<br><br>
The Confederation of British Industry says:
<br><blockquote><p>Social policy matters to business in Europe. EU directives, national employment regulations and workplace developments all have the potential to either help or constrain the growth of competitive businesses. Reform of social policy at all levels is needed to create a Europe that works.</p></blockquote>
That is what the document is about. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings said that it is too vague and potentially too prescriptive. I do not know whether the document adds to the gaiety of the nation or whether any document at the initial stage of consultation is particularly riveting. There is a debate about the style used in European documents.<br><br>
However, this document does set out the clear objectives of more and better jobs, anticipating and managing change and adapting to the new working environment that many of the other liberalisation measures will create. It is about exploiting the opportunities of the knowledge-driven economy, promoting mobility, social inclusion, and gender equality, combating discrimination, preparing for enlargement and promoting international co-operation.<br><br>
We are in violent agreement on one issue, although the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings showed the misunderstanding that exists. We are concerned to approach the objectives in a way that meets the procedures agreed at Lisbon. We want to get away from the regulation route, particularly on employment. We are not saying that regulation is always unnecessary; it is occasionally needed.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
However, our view, which we have articulated in Europe and which has been influential, is that the best way forward is through sharing best practice, benchmarking and peer review—which is not Charlie Falconer looking at the situation every five minutes—rather than going along the legislative route. As the document points out, that route does not serve the interests of those who are not in work, who are too often excluded from social dialogue.<br><br>
The document talks specifically about taking forward the Lisbon summit. The right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does it contain any deregulation measures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden asked about specific measures on deregulation. First, the document states that one of its objectives is
<br><blockquote><p>establishing framework conditions and removing all remaining barriers to the development of the services sector to enable job creation in services.</p></blockquote>
Another objective—expressed in what is not the finest use of the English language—is
<br><blockquote><p>pursuing economic reform of product services and capital markets and reinforcing their co-ordination with and contribution to a stability-orientated macroeconomic policy strategy, with the objective of strengthening the employment content of growth.</p></blockquote>
A third objective is
<br><blockquote><p>promoting entrepreneurship and job creation, which will be helped by creating a friendly environment for starting up and developing innovative businesses, particularly SMEs.</p></blockquote>
Those are three small examples of issues related to deregulation. However, if Opposition Members are to vote against that policy document, they will have to decide whether they disagree with the objectives. Obviously, the means of putting them into force will be subject to the normal process of scrutiny and debate, but, as the CBI says, the objectives must be right. Most of the European social model and approaches were developed in a completely different age, not the knowledge-driven economy of the 21st century.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden asked another question, which I shall try to answer, about social security Ministers. The fact is that social security Ministers meet regularly, both at informal and formal social policy councils. The modernisation of social protection schemes has been debated on several occasions and the emphasis remains, as it was in Dublin, on sharing experience and learning from each other, not on harmonisation.<br><br>
I have to be in Westminster Hall to handle a debate at 1 pm, but I say in conclusion that we do not want a social agenda that is wholly reliant on unnecessary intervention and regulation and that stifles enterprise and prevents the creation of new jobs. That is precisely the argument that we most recently put forward at the Lisbon summit. That is not to say that we are against regulation where it is necessary; it may be necessary to regulate if—and only if—other solutions are unlikely to succeed.<br><br>
As I said, the Commission's communication is part of a wider process that will culminate in the presidency's proposals to the Nice European Council. Our
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0955">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
discussions are therefore timely as the Government will be able to take them into account when preparing their response to the presidency proposals.</span></p>
<p>12.53 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to keep the Committee long—and I certainly do not want to keep the Minister from his important engagement in Westminster Hall. However, the meaning of our debate today is either that the document is a series of uncosted platitudes—motherhood and apple pie, to quote the hon. Member for South Thanet, although he could have said fatherhood and sauerkraut—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or apple strudel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. It is either that or it is the forerunner of a plethora of new regulations, restrictions and controls. It must be one or the other. We have not been told clearly which it is. Some hon. Members have said that the proposals are bound to lead to further legislation, because action leads to measures—all euphemisms for further legislation—and others have said, "No, we will stand firm. This will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
not mean anything additional—it will just mean co-ordinating what we are doing already." For those reasons, the document and the explanation of it are fundamentally unsatisfactory. We will not press the matter to a vote today, because no measures are proposed. However, when the measures that will inevitably result from the uncosted platitudes come before the Committee or the House, I assure hon. Members that Conservatives will stand up, as they alone now do in the House, for the British national interest.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 9964/00, a European Commission Communication on a European Social Policy Agenda for the next five years; supports the Government's welcome for the Commission's analysis of the challenges facing employment and social policy in the next five years and for the emphasis placed on increasing employability, on combating social exclusion, on promoting entrepreneurship, whilst opposing proposals that impose unnecessary burdensome new legislation particularly upon business, and remaining convinced of the need for proposals to codify, adapt or improve existing legislation or for new legislation to be made clear and workable; and notes the Government's intention to negotiate to this end, and to ensure that the proposals take proper account of the legitimate concerns of employers and the need to raise employment rates across the Community.</p></blockquote></p>
