	<p>	<i>[Relevant Documents: European Union Document No. 13540/99.]</i></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities (Ms Tessa Jowell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome today's debate, which is an important opportunity to discuss some issues arising from the European Commission's proposal to implement article 13 of the treaty. The Committee will be aware that negotiations on the article 13 package have been taken forward much more quickly than we anticipated. That acceleration of pace was due to decisions made by the Portuguese and the French presidencies. The French presidency made it clear that it intends to reach agreement on the proposal by 17 October or 3 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change of pace has made formal consultation difficult. The Commission has not had time to issue revised texts of the proposal in time for the usual process. However, we have consulted a number of relevant organisations since negotiations began, including the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the Federation of Small Businesses, Age Concern, Eurolink Age, the Commission for Racial Equality, the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Disability Rights Commission and representatives of Churches and other religious organisations. We have consulted also the Catholic board of education, the General Synod board of education, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and representatives of the interfaith forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the rapid pace of negotiation, and the absence of an up-to-date public version of the proposal, today's debate should be seen as a report on work in progress. I start by setting out our assessment of the framework directive and our negotiating objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal was published in November 1999 as part of a package of three proposals made under article 13—a directive on racial discrimination, an action programme to support the legislative action taken forward by the directives and the proposal that the Committee is considering today. Initially, the three proposals were considered in parallel, but during the second half of the Portuguese presidency negotiations concentrated on the race directive. That directive has been agreed, and negotiations are now focusing on the employment directive: the subject of today's debate. The action programme is close to being agreed, but a considerable amount of work remains to be done on the employment directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
I shall deal briefly with the relationship between the three measures. The original proposals contained an area of overlap. Both directives covered discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin in employment and training, and a number of concepts were common to both—for example, indirect discrimination. The Commission has not yet produced a revised text for the proposed employment directive following agreement on the race directive, but in the light of consultation with the European Parliament we expect one to be issued in the first half of October. We expect the revised proposal to take up those articles in the now agreed race directive that cover common areas so that, for example, the definition of indirect discrimination will be common to both directives and the grounds of race and ethnic origin will be removed from the employment directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In outline, the proposal will set minimum standards throughout the European Community. It is important to stress that we are discussing a framework directive that is intended to establish minimum standards. It would prohibit direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability and age or sexual orientation in employment or training. It would also prohibit harassment on those grounds. In respect of disability, it would provide for reasonable accommodation to be made to enable disabled people to participate or advance in employment. It would apply to general conditions for access to employment, self employment and occupation. That would include selection criteria and recruitment conditions, as well as access to vocational guidance and training. It would also apply to employment and working conditions, including those which relate to dismissals, pay and membership of workers' or employers' organisations or professional organisations. It would also provide for specific exceptions to allow differences of treatment when that is justified. For example, it would apply in respect of religious organisations that require employees to have certain religious convictions. It provides that direct discrimination on the grounds of age could be justified by a legitimate aim, such as a labour market objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework directive would allow for, but not require, positive action to compensate for the disadvantages people might experience because of their religious belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. It would shift the burden of proof in cases of alleged discrimination, other than in criminal procedures. That would ensure that after the establishment of a prima facie case to answer, it would be for the respondent to prove that there had been no breach of the principle of equal treatment. It is important to understand that the directive is codifying existing case law, which currently allows for that. The directive also covers victimisation, in order to protect employees against dismissal or other adverse treatment by the employer that is administered as a reaction to a complaint on grounds of equal treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those will be minimum standards. As is the case with most framework directives, it is open to member states to introduce more far-reaching provisions should they wish to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have welcomed the proposal. It is important to establish minimum standards to combat discrimination at work throughout the whole European
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
Community. The key to tackling discrimination, however, is not just the aspiration to end it—an aspiration that we all share. It is essential to ensure workable and proportionate mechanisms that deliver redress effectively. Otherwise, we risk introducing a parody of proper standards and unnecessary litigation. Such an outcome would undermine the confidence of the public, employers and employees, whose support is essential to the effectiveness of the measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That principle is in line with our domestic agenda on equality. The Government are strongly committed to combating unjustified discrimination wherever it exists. We have stated that publicly, and it forms a cornerstone of many of our current domestic policies. Unjustified discrimination in work and training can be damaging and wasteful of talent. We are also actively promoting equality and diversity through the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill, which includes a duty on public bodies to promote equality. We will introduce similar measures in sex and disability discrimination legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In negotiating the proposal, we are working towards a final text that is clear and workable to the employers, workers and training providers whom it will affect. We want it to take full account of measures already in place, such as our Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Disability Rights Commission Act 1999 and other disability rights legislation. It is evident both to the Government and to the European Scrutiny Committee that the European Commission's proposal needs to be improved if it is to be clear and fully workable in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Scrutiny Committee focused on the potential problems arising from the inclusion in the text of a single instrument such different grounds for discrimination. In particular, that raises problems for discrimination on grounds of age and disability. The Government agree with the Committee in its assessment that the "one size fits all" approach is difficult. The types of discrimination that the proposal seeks to address are different from each other and require differently tailored solutions. The current proposals do not adequately reflect that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Am I right in understanding that, in European Committees, the Minister is required to make a short opening statement to advise hon. Members of the business and then to allow questions? The Minister has been speaking for 10 minutes. Does that constitute "short"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no fixed time limit for the Minister. The understanding is that the Minister's statement should take no more than 10 minutes; and she is drawing her remarks to a close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gale. I have been addressing my remarks to the Committee with an eye on the clock. I wish to give members of the Committee as much information as possible to help their consideration of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The issue of what requirements religious organisations can make of their staff has been raised by the European Scrutiny Committee and by many outside organisations. I hope that the Committee will be reassured to learn that we intend to do all that we can to ensure that the proposals are modified so that religious organisations may continue to discriminate on the grounds of religion and belief when it is justifiable to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Scrutiny Committee has also expressed concern that loose drafting in the proposal could lead to problems of interpretation and to extensive litigation. We share those concerns. An equality regime that is not clear about what people, especially employers, need to do to comply is likely to be counter-productive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussions with our negotiating partners, we have also been exploring the scope for extending the implementation period, which is currently two years. We attach considerable importance to having a longer transposition period, which would allow time for culture change and change of practice in preparation for the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, we are pledged to combating discrimination and are generally supportive of the Commission's proposal. However, we are determined to ensure that the proposal is right—that it is clear and workable in practice and that it can be implemented in the United Kingdom in a way that is consistent with our existing equality framework. It is most important that we get the law right in this area if we are to move the cause of equality forwards and not backwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We now have until 5.30 pm for the Minister to answer questions. I remind all members of the Committee to keep questions short, if possible, and to ask them singly. That should deliver concise answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bercow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Buckingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for her opening statement. First, I wish to establish whether the Government are unhesitatingly committed to the idea of a directive and have now excluded from the range of possibilities a decision to veto it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and along much the same lines, is the right hon. Lady satisfied that on grounds of proportionality it is proper for the European Union to legislate on the matter? She is doubtless aware of article 3b of the Maastricht treaty and the protocol on the application of principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in the Amsterdam treaty. Is the European Union behaving properly in proceeding with the proposed directive despite the apparent assurances—I use the word "apparent" advisedly—that we received on the passage of both treaties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, will the night hon. Lady confirm that despite the attempt to bring forward negotiations on the directive, the Government have no intention of being hurried towards reaching a conclusion because of the legislative or political ambitions of other member states? In the absence of an assurance on that point, I can only assume that she is happy to be bullied on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0917">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
I have a final question to the right hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is aware that I asked hon. Members to ask one question, not four.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I hope I made it clear in my remarks that the negotiation is in progress and our objectives are clear. The devil of such a directive is in the detail, and several other member states would share that view. We can all sign up to the principle that it is intended to serve, but the key is to establish a framework text that will be workable in practice. That is the answer to the first question. The test that we shall apply will be whether we are happy to sign up to the text that is finally negotiated and whether we are content that it is workable. We are negotiating in good faith to achieve that, because we support the directive's principle objective. However, we would not support a flawed means of securing it; we are engaged in negotiations to secure what the UK Government want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on the question of subsidiarity and proportionality, a responsibility exists with respect to employment and I am satisfied that both tests are met. The question raises important points about safeguarding the text of the directive as a framework text setting minimum standards. We would want to avoid an overly-descriptive text or one that undermined domestic legislation that was working well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finaly, I hope that I have already made it clear that we will not be hurried into signing up to a directive that we do not believe to be workable. The interests that we want to serve would not be served by rushed and unworkable legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Gale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are religious organisations, particularly schools, allowed to do at present in pursuit of preferences with respect the people whom they employ? Will that state of affairs be affected if the measure is passed in its present state?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As things stand, there is clear statutory protection for schools in preserving their religious ethos. One of our key negotiating objectives is to retain the present relevant legislative framework under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. We want Church schools to remain free to recruit teaching staff of the faith in question. As my hon. Friend will know, the current provisions do not extend to ancillary staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare a non-pecuniary interest in that I find, from reading its letterhead, that I am an honorary associate of the National Secular Society. Compared with our current law, in what areas would new rights and protections be introduced for those who face discrimination if the directive were implemented, either in its current form or in the form favoured by the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to disability, the relevant domestic legislation is the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. There are differences between the provisions of that legislation and the provisions in the framework
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
directive that relate to disability. We are seeking to ensure that the definition of "reasonable adjustment" in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will be the test that operates under the directive, rather than the definition of indirect discrimination that currently applies. The extent to which new rights will be conferred is at the margin and open to interpretation. New rights will be conferred in relation to discrimination on the grounds of age, sexual orientation and religion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I formally welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister throw a little more light on the definition of the word "disability" used in the directive, and say when the Commission's proposed study into different definitions of disability used throughout the Community will be completed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directive does not define disability, and that is a problem. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 does define disability, and I can quote the definition if it would help the hon. Gentleman. The Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>a person has a disability … if he has a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.</p></blockquote>
If there is no definition, the risk is that disability will be interpreted differently in different member states. In addition, domestic law could be reinterpreted in the light of judgments of the European Court of Justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Commission's study of definitions of disability, we understand that the proposals were not intended to inform these negotiations. That may come as much of a surprise to the right hon. Gentleman as it does to me, but we do not expect the study to be published this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Borrow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ribble)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow up the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), who referred to the areas in which the directive could extend legislation, and my right hon. Friend specifically mentioned discrimination on the basis of age and sexual orientation. I know that the Minister's policy has been to allow those areas to be dealt with by voluntary codes of practice. However, in view of the fact that we envisage the introduction of legislation following the directive, will the Department for Education and Employment give a higher priority to the speedy implementation of a code of practice, and create the impetus for discussions with employers to ensure that such codes are observed in preparation for legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is already a code of practice on age diversity, which is intended to deal with ageism at work. That has been circulated to about 70,000 employers. We have made it clear that its impact will be evaluated before a decision about legislation is taken. The evaluation is due to be completed towards the middle of next year. The Equal Opportunities Commission is currently preparing a code of practice on sexual orientation, and that work is still in progress. We expect it to be completed some time next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne McIntosh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Gale.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
The Minister referred to existing case law and mentioned that, under the framework directive, the burden of proof would be reversed, so that respondents would have to prove that there had been no breach on the grounds of discrimination. I thought that the Minister said that that burden of proof already existed. Will she help the Committee by explaining what is the relevant case law and say when the European Court of Justice gave a ruling on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The standard case in this area is that of Zafar, which the House of Lords judged in 1997. The matter was considered at great length in the final stages before the race directive was agreed. Previously, there was much uninformed comment about the impact of the shift in the burden of proof The directive clearly incorporates existing case law into the requirement to establish a prima facie case of discrimination before the respondent has to prove that the discrimination did not take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon, Friend will be aware of the widespread concern about the drafting of article 4, which deals with genuine occupational qualifications. Will she make specific representations to the European Union about the definitions of church youth workers and Christian playgroups? They are concerned about the implications for their activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall certainly pursue the interests of those groups of workers during our negotiations, and I hope that I have made our negotiating objective clear. The enormous amount of correspondence that I have passed on to the Commission shows that the matter is of great public concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply concerned about small and medium-sized businesses. On the regulatory impact, the Minister says in her explanatory memorandum:
	<br><blockquote><p>The proposal will have implications for business. A full analysis will be carried out in consultation with … organisations from the business world.</p></blockquote>
She mentions the Confederation of British Industry, the Federation of Small Businesses and many other organisations. However, when the European Scrutiny Committee, of which I am a member, asked the Minister questions at the end of June, she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>We need to consider the impact on business and jobs.</p></blockquote>
The consultation process began in January, but the implications were still being considered in June. Is that because the representative organisations consulted by the Minister remain—rightly—deeply concerned about the implications of the proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not the case. I hope that I have made it clear that we have undertaken consultation with a number of organisations. It is fair to say that substantial concern has not yet been registered. The CBI is most concerned about the consequences of the age provisions. I have met members of the CBI and I know that they are more concerned about the legislation's impact in relation to age discrimination than on any other ground. We shall
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
prepare a consultation document and a regulatory impact assessment at the beginning of September—it would not be appropriate to do so in August as many people will be on holiday—to give us the benefit of consultation before the Council meeting in mid-October.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear to me, as a member of the European Scrutiny Committee, that despite the Minister's comments concerns remain among some members of the Committee. Does the Minister consider it fair that the Government, by diluting the directive, will give less protection to the UK than the rest of Europe enjoys, especially as regards religion? A teacher of mathematics or music will have a different liturgical interpretation of, say, becoming a divorced person and remarrying even though the teachings of the Church of which he or she is a member does not allow that practice. As we know, controversy over that very issue surrounds the Queen's son. Such a person would be banned from promotion to any post, even one in which he or she was in an acting capacity, without the protection of this directive framework. Do not the Government consider that if they dilute the directive and that situation occurs, they will be failing in their duty to give equal opportunities to people throughout Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me reiterate that this is intended to be a framework directive. Some states already have legislation on either a constitutional or a domestic law basis. There is legislation to protect against discrimination on some or all of those grounds. The inequality already exists. It is important for the directive to set a framework for minimum standards for protection against discrimination.

My hon. Friend's second point is addressed in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The example that he gave would be a matter for the individual and for school governors. Redress may subsequently be sought at an employment tribunal, if appropriate. Our objective, as I hope I made clear, is to ensure that those provisions remain in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the Minister's understanding that the directive as currently drafted, or in the form in which the right hon. Lady wishes it to be amended, would ban age discrimination in advertising? If it is, would the Government allow the measure to be talked out on the Floor of the House even though a Government Back Bencher introduced it? Does not the hon. Lady agree that there is already age discrimination, and that many constituents feel strongly that such action is needed even more urgently now than it was two or three years ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is strong public support for protection against discrimination on the ground of age. It is important to remember, however, that the directive applies only to employment and occupation, and some aspects of training, so it would not cover advertising, to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer back to the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) about religious schools. I received a lot of correspondence on this issue. Although it would be generally acceptable for religious schools to be able to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0919">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
appoint members of staff from that faith, who decides whether an individual belongs to that faith? Does he simply announce that he belongs to it or must that be accepted by the governing body? From the tone of some of the correspondence, it seems that a strong link is made between discrimination on religious grounds and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Apparently many religious schools do not employ gay men or women as they could not be a member of that faith because of their sexuality. The Government need to take a strong line on this issue. I should be grateful for my right hon. Friend's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The concern that my hon. Friend raises would be a matter for domestic implementation. I have seen a range of correspondence that has been generated by this issue. We are keen to protect people who have risked discrimination on grounds of their religious faith, but by the same token, that should not enable bigotry to be dressed up as religious necessity. That will be an important consideration when we look at the implementation of the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the right hon. Lady that he Department's explanatory memorandum of 6 January referred to the production of a code of practice on discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation being undertaken not by but in conjunction with the Equal Opportunities Commission. That commitment was reinforced on 14 July last year by the Secretary of State in a communication with the head of the EOC, Julie Mellor, and the Minister for Employment and Equal Opportunities, the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) referred to the production of the code in a debate in Westminster Hall on 21 December 1999. May I ask first for confirmation that it is a joint responsibility to produce the draft code, not merely the responsibility of the EOC and secondly, for an explanation of why it is taking such an inordinately long time to produce?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has taken the time it takes to do the job properly. The hon. Gentleman is right that the work on the code is being undertaken by the EOC at the request of the DFEE, but the code will be produced and published by the EOC. I hope that Ministers will be fully associated with it when it is published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the change in the burden of proof, I can understand why article 9 states that the burden should be with the defendant rather than the plaintiff, because of the problematic nature of obtaining evidence in such cases. What representations has the Minister received from employers' and employees' groups on this issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, we have received no representations from employers' or employees' groups on this issue. There will obviously be a further opportunity for them to make representations, if they want, when we publish the consultation document in early September.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm that article 5 legalises age discrimination in the Community for the first time? If so, how will that help the thousands of people in this country who are over retirement age, but want to continue their employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is correct about the interpretation of the article, which is why we are negotiating to amend it. Many groups representing the interests of older people are concerned. As I said at the outset, in negotiating the directive we are trying to deliver genuine protection against discrimination for the relevant groups. As drafted, the article extends protection against age discrimination to people of all ages rather than focusing specifically on older people, for whom, on the available evidence, age discrimination is most damaging. It is damaging to the individual and to the labour market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 1 is quite specific. It covers discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, but not of sexual behaviour. Does that mean that an employer cannot discriminate because he believes that someone is gay or lesbian, but can discriminate if he believes that they are involved in a same sex relationship?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the answer is almost certainly no. The directive is intended to protect people from discrimination that they may encounter in the workplace—homophobic bullying, name calling and so forth—rather than to extend its reach behind the doors of their homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister had the opportunity to assess the impact on employers of provisions on sexual orientation? My understanding of the Zafar case is that it was a House of Lords judgment about race relations; it was not tested in the European Court of Justice, but may yet be tested there. For the first time, the burden of proof reversal is being extended to the category of sexual orientation. How many cases does the Minister believe might be brought to the courts, and at what cost to employers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the reaction of employers. I have had discussions with the CBI, which took a relaxed view of actions to tackle discrimination at work on grounds of sexual orientation. Several employers' and employees' bodies will be useful in that respect after consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Zafar case was not taken to the European Court of Justice, but the Enderby case was, so the burden of proof has already been tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 15 envisages that the directive will be implemented by 31 December 2002. The Minister said that she hoped for an extension. What representations on implementation has she received from outside bodies? Are we looking at four years, five years or whatever?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had some discussion about that aspect of implementation with Ministers from other member states. I believe that we will benefit from a longer implementation period, which I will actively negotiate with my counterparts. A longer transposition period is important for two reasons. First, good protection against discrimination is based not just on well worked out law, but on a change in culture. That explains our decision to publish a code of practice on age discrimination that focuses on changing the culture of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0920">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
employers while making them clear about the business and labour market benefits of greater diversity. Secondly, if that does not achieve a sufficient shift, we can legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we will be able to negotiate a longer period. I cannot give a fixed date because we are in negotiation. However, I realise that businesses should have the opportunity to adapt. They need to consider and identify internal practices that might be discriminatory. A period of reasonable adjustment is proper. It will ensure that protection is properly extended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that all Committee members have constituents who are being discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or age and that that is not blocked in British or current European law, does the Minister not think that there is an urgency to introducing the protection, especially in light of the Government's record of voting against my hon. Friends' amendments to the Employment Relations Bill that would have banned discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual orientation and age?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go back to what I said earlier. The most important consideration in employment legislation is to get it right. We must deliver legislation that works in practice. Legislation that is based on a hasty, cobbled together set of proposals that unravel in the European Court of Justice or domestically, or which are disproportionately burdensome on business, must be avoided. It is important that anti-discrimination legislation is respected by those it protects and those who are its agents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the proposals are implemented, will the Conservative party have to take on Labour party members who apply for jobs, and vice versa? If so, how will article 2, which deals with indirect discrimination on the basis of display of material, be qualified to allow the display of material that promotes the cause of that particular party in the workplace?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the proposals extend to discrimination on the grounds of political affiliation. Passionately though we may hold our political beliefs, I do not think that they would pass muster or meet the definition for belief that will be represented in the directive. The answer, therefore, is no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under article 4 of the proposed directive, would a Christian school be entitled to insist on employing a Christian secretary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Domestic legislation regards a secretary as an ancillary member of staff rather than as a member of the teaching staff, therefore his or her religious faith would not be stipulated. As I said earlier, our negotiating objective is to secure the same protection in the directive as there is in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) would follow up his previous question, but as he did not do so, I shall. My understanding from the statements made by the Catholic hierarchy during the section 28 debate is that to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
be a homosexual is not against the Church's liturgical teachings, therefore a homosexual can teach in a Catholic school. However, if teachers commit homosexual acts, that would be in breach of the liturgical teachings of the Catholic Church and they would automatically excommunicate themselves and therefore set themselves outwith the teachings of the Church. Could they be asked to leave, as they may not be a practising member of that Church? Is it not time that we moved away from biased and unfair judgments on the lifestyles of people who are there to teach? They should not be judged on their private lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interpretation of the text of the directive in the context of United Kingdom legislation, which is more specific than the directive, is that in the circumstances that my hon. Friend describes, nothing would prevent a Church school from recruiting a teacher who was homosexual if such an individual who was of the faith represented by the school applied for a post. However, there is a further proviso in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 that has an impact on behaviour and provides safeguards to ensure that behaviour is consistent with the teachings of the faith represented by the school. Our objective is to maintain the status quo, which includes redress for individuals within the established means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two terms are used in paragraph 4 of article 2: "reasonable accommodation" and "undue hardship". What do those two terms mean and how will the provisions operate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Reasonable accommodation" is in the text as a result of our negotiation to align the directive on disability as closely as possible with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. A second test in that Act is one of justification or reasonableness. We think that undue hardship is an unreasonable and unduly exacting requirement for an employee to have to demonstrate. It is not helpful and our negotiations will try to remove it from the text. Our objective is to have a text that is as closely aligned as possible to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill), and ask the Minister to contact the leaders of the various faith groups to get some understanding of their views on how they would react to legislation banning discrimination in schools on the basis of sexual orientation. Until now, that has not been an issue and we consequently do not know how the faith groups would react. However, in parts of the country, such as my own constituency in Lancashire, over 50 per cent. of primary school places are in Church schools, and we need to reflect on the introduction of a directive that is supposed to end discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation but will still allow 50 per cent. of teachers to be discriminated against. I ask the Minister, before we go further with the directive, to get views from the leaders of the various faith groups on how they would interpret any conflict between religious discrimination and discrimination on the basis of sexuality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to assure my hon. Friend that we will have those discussions but, as I said, we shall negotiate a position that reflects the status quo.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I asked the Minister about case law, she referred to the Zafar case and then to the Enderby case. What principle was established in the Enderby case? Would not the Government be best advised to leave section 28 until the remit of the directive is clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I am not sure that section 28 has anything to do with the Enderby case or with the burden of proof. That case focused on an occupational therapist, Pamela Enderby, who brought an action on the basis that she was paid less than a counterpart—from memory, I think it was a clinical psychologist—and was therefore indirectly discriminated against. It was a long-running case, lasting for 12 years, and was extremely unsatisfactory because many of the comparators—the people who did work that she judged equivalent—left during that time. The case went to the European Court of Justice and was upheld.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 8 of the directive outlines in full procedures on access to justice to enable the enforcement of any obligations deriving from the directives. Has the Minister considered the implications of that in regard to the ending of legal aid to assist plaintiffs to pursue claims where they are wronged?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the sort of issue that we will consider in further negotiation, but we do not believe that legal aid presently extends to such actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the concern that we share about the representation of women in the House, in all parties and in other professions, has the Minister estimated the directive's effect on the ability of countries to promote positive action to improve the representation of women in legislatures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is none. As the directive does not extend to gender, it includes no provision for positive action to increase the representation of women in legislatures. The Labour party is proud of its record of increasing the representation of women, which we intend to continue. However, we shall not seek the means to do so in law, through the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That brings us to the end of the time allotted to questions. The hon. Member for South Thanet may want to catch my eye to speak in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 13540/99, relating to Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation—[	<i>Ms Jowell.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We note the motion that the Government have tabled, and we are happy to take note of the European Union document, but this is a case of thus far and no further. We are not prepared to give a general welcome to the proposals for two reasons. First, Conservative Members find the content of the proposals deeply unsatisfactory, and, secondly, we do not believe that these matters properly fall within the aegis of European Union institutions. I begin by focusing my remarks on that important constitutional question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Earlier, I challenged the right hon. Lady on whether she thought that it was entirely in order for the European Union, or the European Commission, to present the proposals in light of the provisions on subsidiarity and proportionality in the treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam. Her answer was that she thought that it was entirely proper for the European Commission to do so. My starting point is that of my noble Friend Baroness Miller, who argued on 30 June in the debate in another place that these were properly matters for national determination. Counteracting discrimination and the means by which to do so are quintessentially matters for democratically elected members of national legislatures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the right hon. Lady to article 3b, as it was described at the time, of the treaty of Amsterdam, which covers subsidiarity. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The right hon. Lady looks a trifle perplexed. I assure her that she should not be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am smiling at the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Lady makes the position clear by saying that she is smiling at me. I am grateful to her for her smile, and I apologise for having accused her of being confused or perplexed when in fact she was neither but was merely offering me an engaging smile, which I am happy immediately to reciprocate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On subsidiarity, article 3b of the treaty of Maastricht states:
	<br><blockquote><p>In areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community.</p></blockquote>
Advocates of subsidiarity maintained at the time that that provision constituted protection for the rights of nation states and that it would mean that in most cases decisions would be taken at national or even sub-national—regional or local—level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the treaty of Amsterdam not establish the EU's right to become involved in discrimination matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipates me. He is characteristically well informed. I did not buy into article 3b; indeed, I confess that I described it both at the time and subsequently as the infamous article 3b of the treaty of Maastricht. However, many people did: they argued that such matters should not be matters for a Community initiative because they more readily lend themselves to national decision making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to lead me to the treaty of Amsterdam, and specifically to the protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality contained within it, because what it has to say on the subject is germane to our proceedings. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>The application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality shall respect the general provisions and objectives of the treaty, particularly as regards the maintaining in full—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0922">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
not in part, but in full—
	<br><blockquote><p>of the acqui communautaire and the institutional balance; it shall not affect the principles developed by the Court of Justice regarding the relationship between national and Community law, and it should take into account article F4 of the treaty on European Union, according to which the Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with great care, because I share my hon. Friend's concern about subsidiarity in this matter. I wonder whether, as he develops his argument, he would weave into it a commentary on how article 13 of the treaty impacts on what he is saying. I should be grateful for my hon. Friend's help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that intervention. My understanding is that article 13 reflects the view of the European Union that it is proper for it to seek to legislate in this area. That implies either that at the time of Maastricht and, more particularly, of the treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union fully intended that the protocol should provide it with the legislative wherewithal and the flexibility subsequently to bring forward proposals such as it now presents to us; or that there has been a change of heart within the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend and I can have a legitimate and inspiring debate on that point. My guestimate is that the European Union is likely to have had a fairly fixed view on the subject because non-discriminatory provisions, such as the equal treatment directive, are already in place. A body of European law on the subject already exists and the European Union has a track record of taking a particular view. My guess is that at the time of the treaty of Maastricht, and certainly by the time of the protocol of the treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union fully anticipated that it would be able to bring forward legislation of the kind that it now proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am focusing on that point because, although the contents of the proposals are of the greatest importance and should be debated, it seems to me and to my right hon. and hon. Friends that the question of who legislates, who governs, and to whom the legislators or Government are accountable are the essence of democracy. In a sense, I am grateful to the right hon. Lady because, when I asked whether, in the light of the provisions on subsidiarity and proportionality, she thought that the Community was behaving itself, she answered in the affirmative. I then asked her—but this may have been my first question—whether the Government had ruled out the possibility of vetoing the directive. On that point, the right hon. Lady's position was much less satisfactory. I have to chide her on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not yet had the chance to chide the right hon. Lady, but if she is getting itchy about it, I shall happily give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we know is that no answer would satisfy the hon. Gentleman except the answer no, because he would veto anything that came from the EU. As we know, he is a leading member of the Europhile tendency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Europhile?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant Europhobe. I made it clear that we are negotiating, and it would be foolish to anticipate the outcome. We hope to negotiate successfully, but we have made it clear that a lot remains to be done between now and then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the clarification that she has provided. As most Committee members will know, I am a moderate Euro-realist. I take it from the right hon. Lady's remarks that there is not the slightest prospect of the Government vetoing the directive, at least in this millennium. However, if one wants to exert any sort of negotiating influence on one's European partners, it is not a bad idea at least to convey the impression that there might be circumstances in which the content of the proposals would be considered by the British Government or Parliament to be so unacceptable that they required a veto. Frankly, the right hon. Lady is giving the game away by saying that it is a matter of detail and by trying to finesse the discussion and to secure agreement by removing a few of the directive's less attractive features.

I am grateful to her, however, for the clarity and specificity with which she has shown us that there is no prospect of a veto and that we are arguing merely about the detail. She does not deny the appropriateness of European Union action on the matters with which the directive deals, but my right hon. and hon. Friends assuredly do. That is a key dividing line between us: on one side there is the Europhile tendency, as represented by the Government, who are happy to accept the idea that the European Union should legislate on anti-discrimination provisions that are to apply in the United Kingdom; and on the other side of the fence is the Conservative party, which believes that these are properly matters for determination at national—and assuredly not supranational—level.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman moves off the European issue—if, indeed, he is doing so—I have a question. How would it be possible to operate the single market, for which a Conservative Government voted, without some uniformity in employment rights within the labour market? How could an employee in Germany be allowed to work in another member state, but be sacked for doing exacttly the same work in this country, in the same single market, without redress?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative party has never accepted that it is necessary to introduce uniformity of labour market provision as part of the single market, which is a project designed to facilitate increased trade and the free exchange of goods and services. We have never agreed that there must be a commonality of labour market provisions and anti-discrimination legislation between all member states of the EU—an idea that brings a recent and unwelcome import into the political debate in Britain and which is a new-fangled creation that has been sedulously propagated by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon and others. It was not

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is right. If I remember rightly, strenuous efforts were made by Lord Hunt when he was Secretary of State for Employment and, subsequently, by my right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo), to resist the encroachment of the European Union in respect of the European working time directive. We were unsuccessful, but the rationale behind our opposition to that directive was entirely consistent with the rationale that we are deploying now.

The hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Brown) is getting itchy, but I give way first to the hon. Member for South Thanet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman employ his formidable memory and tell us when the treaty that committed us to the free movement of labour in the European Union was signed? Did the Conservative party agree to that treaty and is it now resiling from it? If it is not resiling, would the hon. Gentleman be prepared to accept that a French company could discriminate against him on the grounds that he is English?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last point is, frankly, vexatious. On the main question, I confess that I do not remember the precise date of the treaty. I should probably be punished for my failure to do so, but that is the fact. In his remaining 11 months or so in the House, the hon. Member for South Thanet is seeking to get me into trouble by drawing me into a debate about past treaties. I would be happy outside the Committee to refer the hon. Gentleman to my past pronouncements on the subject of relations between Britain and the EU. I will not revisit all the treaties. In relation to important point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), the statement of the Advocate General on the application of the working time directive was made, if memory serves me correctly, on 12 March 1996. I remember it and I rue it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to press the hon. Gentleman on his views regarding the difference between labour and products in a single market. He would be the first to be up in arms if British chocolate or a British widget was banned and could not be bought in another EU country, yet he seems happy for a British Jewish grocer not to be allowed to practice his work in Germany or France. Similarly, he would be happy for Britain to be allowed to discriminate against a Belgian Catholic in a way that would not be allowed by Belgians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bereow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a genuine conceptual difference between the hon. Gentleman and me. The hon. Gentleman seems to think that, for there to be a free market, one must have equality of legal treatment in respect not only of goods but of people. He would no doubt argue that one must also have absolutely free movement of labour in a free market, but I would not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
accept that view. It is possible credibly and intellectually to distinguish between the market freedoms that the hon. Gentleman has in mind. A free market in goods and services is desirable, but it does not require the application of uniform rules concerning the employment of persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will make an important announcement—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] No, I will not sit down. I will give way to the hon. Member for South Ribble, who has a long-standing and intelligent interest in the matters, and will then proceed to develop my case. I think that the hon. Gentleman will admit that I have been very generous in giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I pose to him a hypothetical case. While enjoying his summer recess, the hon. Gentleman found his surgery suddenly inundated with 50 or 60 people who had come to see him because a subsidiary of a multinational company had decided to close down its Buckingham operations rather than those in Germany or France. The excuse given to the trade union in the constituency was that the company had had to act not because of a difference in production costs, but because the costs of making people redundant were lower here than in the rest of Europe. Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that having a level playing field for workers would at least allow him to defend his role as a Member of Parliament? Would he instead say—as I think he would say—that he is happy for his work force in Buckingham to have inferior conditions compared with workers in Europe and if that meant that they got sacked, so be it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the case that the hon. Gentleman raises is entirely hypothetical—there is no such prospect in the Buckingham constituency at present, I am pleased to say. Secondly, I am happy to confirm that the Conservative party does not believe an upward ratchet of heavier and more expensive regulation of the labour market, as posited in the hon. Gentleman's example, to be in the interests of business competitiveness. That would not be desirable
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked about a level playing field. It might be important to have a level playing field, but it is important in the final analysis to have people employed in businesses that are expanding, producing goods, making profits and contributing to the prosperity of the nation in which they are situated. The hon. Gentleman's proposal would almost certainly militate against that. It is understandable that he makes that proposal because his party, in government, has been practising an anti-business philosophy and culture for the past three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is in full flow, I should draw his attention to the fact that labour market figures published last week showed that over 1 million more people were in work than in May 1997.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be widely recognised that employment has increased in spite of, not because, of, the Government's policies. The change is attributable,

first and foremost, to the favourable economic legacy bequeathed to the right hon. Lady and her colleagues by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and, secondly, to the wise decision of the previous Conservative Government to free themselves from some of the more burdensome European Union regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is fascinating, but it might be helpful if we returned to the directive under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are absolutely right to chide me, Mr. Gale. I am happy to return to the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady and others have properly referred to the regulatory burden. The Government should show much greater concern about the potential impact on businesses of the European Commission proposals. I say that in the light of business representatives' comments. I think that the Minister and I would agree on one point: that, generally, businesses are keener now than ever to pursue anti-discrimination policies wherever possible. We should probably also agree—although we have not discussed the point—that at present some of the larger companies in Britain are particularly keen on non-discrimination provisions and are particularly good at putting them into effect. That is at least in part because the costs to them are often not as great, either financially—with respect to compliance with regulatory burdens—or in the reaction of their staff, as is the case for smaller firms. Often, the management in a very large company will take a lead and apply non-discriminatory provisions, which is a welcome development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Lady will bear in mind the fact that 99.6 per cent. of firms in this country employ fewer than 100 people; that those account for approximately 50 per cent. of the private sector work force; and that the firms in question generate 40 per cent. of national output. Their concerns are important and should not be dismissed. In that context, I refer the Minister to the verdict—we can disagree about the Government's record between ourselves—of the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. Some chuntering went on from sedentary positions—characteristically from the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)—when I complained a moment ago about the regulatory burden. However, the issue is not whether I, my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde or my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) have complaints to make; it is a question of what business representatives say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Chris Humphries said on 20 January that, whatever their rhetoric, the Government have dramatically increased the regulatory burdens that threaten small business competitiveness. In the light of that comment and the failure to introduce any significant deregulatory measures in the three years that the Government have been in office, Ministers should be wary of accepting burdensome regulation from Europe. They should be particularly wary in the light of the verdict of the director of human resources at the CBI,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
who has been quoted as criticising the present Commission proposals as "fuzzy" and who went on to say that smaller business desperately needs more certainty in employment law and in equal opportunity law. He referred—this is important and salutary—to a 30 per cent. increase in the past 12 months in the number of cases going to employment tribunals and commented that that is a very considerable burden on small businesses in this country. Employees started 164,000 cases in tribunals in the year to 31 March 2000, compared with 124,000—40,000 fewer—in the previous year. I hope that the right hon. Lady will accept that there is a legitimate issue about the burden of regulation on businesses. Baroness Jay of Paddington said on 2 December 1999:
	<br><blockquote><p>We will avoid unnecessary and burdensome regulation and will promote, encourage and support progress through non-legislative means.—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2 December 1999; Vol. 607, c. WA49.]</p></blockquote>
That was an important commitment, which explains why I am keen to press the Minister on the subject of the draft code of practice on discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The right hon. Lady will be aware that Stonewall, which I believe is an honourable and respected campaigning Organisation, has argued for such a code. Indeed, I confess that I recently had a meeting with Angela Mason of Stonewall to discuss the subject. Stonewall would have preferred legislation to be introduced—not a route that the Conservative and Unionist party would want to take—but, on a pragmatic basis, Stonewall is prepared to entertain the idea of a code of practice rather like the Government's code of practice on age discrimination. I want to press the Minister on that point because it seems to me that such a code has been a long time in the offing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is some uncertainty about whether the matter should be led principally by the Equal Opportunities Commission or whether it should be jointly undertaken by the EOC and the Government. Secondly, it is a long time since the Government said, last July, that such a code would be produced. Will the Minister say exactly what the problem is because, although there are issues of principle and there is scope for debate and disagreement, the issues do not seem to me to be especially complex? There are conflicting rights and freedoms and arguments of principle involved, but the court cases on discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation are not hazardous or confusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Minister to two cases. The first, which I expect she will remember, involved South West Trains. The other involved a homosexual employee—called Smith, if my memory serves me correctly—who was discriminated against in his workplace and subsequently pursued a case, which was thrown out. Curiously, when that employee's case was thrown out, it was suggested that he might have succeeded had he been able to show that he was discriminated against by comparison with the way in which a lesbian employee would have been treated. Many fair-minded people would think that that is a strange basis for comparison. Surely, the proper comparison should be whether he was discriminated against by comparison with a heterosexual person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0925">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
Those are interesting and thought-provoking cases, but they are not especially complex. Therefore, the principles that should inform a code of practice that business would be willing to consider are not complex. If the Government are firmly committed to exhausting non-legislative routes before considering legislative routes, we should see the non-legislative route as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to mention the position of religious organisations, in particular Christian organisations, confronted with the European Commission's proposals. I hope that the Minister will accept that there are conflicting rights and freedoms and that it is important to take a balanced view. I want to put it on record that I do not favour discrimination in employment on religious, sexual or racial grounds. There are powerful moral arguments against such discrimination and there is a good case for having a legislative framework, as we cannot rely on voluntary action alone. However, I hope that the Minister recognises the legitimate anxieties of several Christian organisations about the Commission's proposals. There are always people at the margins who hold wacky views or express their views in offensive or unacceptable terms. We have no truck with them. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) may chunter from a sedentary position, but some people have genuine anxieties about the proposals. The anti-discrimination provisions could affect not only Christian organisations seeking to employ Christians only, but Muslim, Jewish, Hindu and many other organisations. I hope that the Minister understands that that is why many Conservatives believe that it is wrong to cede sovereignty on such matters to the European Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a direct relationship between Parliament and our constituents. If we chose to pass an Act of Parliament on discrimination, we would have to take the flak from our opponents and rally our supporters. In the European Union, that umbilical cord between constituents and decision makers does not exist. That is why the entitlement to use the veto is of the essence. If the Minister is open-minded about adopting a directive, she should at least show readiness to use the veto on an unsatisfactory directive. By failing to do that, she leads all Conservative Members to believe that the Government are committed to implementing European Commission proposals either in their present form or in an amended form. That is a source of grave anxiety for the Opposition, and it would be widely opposed throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return the hon. Member for Buckingham to the early part of his speech, in which he discussed the free movement of labour in the European Union. We signed up to that principle when the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) took us into the European Union. The idea was clarified in a 1976 directive, and clarification culminated in the treaty of Amsterdam, which finally established that the EU would need powers to become involved in anti-discrimination issues in member states, to make the free movement of labour a reality. If the Conservative party now resiles from that fundamental principle of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
EU, I am staggered. The Conservatives are effectively saying not only that they do not want to be involved in the euro, but that they want to pull out of the EU altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seeks to make mischief, so I will make it clear beyond doubt that existing provisions on the free movement of labour in the European Union are not in dispute. The Conservative Opposition object only to the idea that existing commitments to a free market in labour somehow oblige us to adopt uniform anti-discrimination legislation across the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals will not create uniformity. They simply propose a baseline below which member states cannot drop. The hon. Gentleman has manufactured the principle of uniformity during the debate. That is specifically excluded from the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the position of religious organisations and schools under the new arrangements, should they be implemented, and about precisely how the proposals will work. I foresee difficult cases unless the text of the articles is absolutely right, and unless subsequent legislation to bring the articles into fruition in this country is absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I want to say that discrimination in any form is bad. It is evil. Discrimination does not become good because it is carried out by good people. Religious people working in religious organisations who carry out a policy of discrimination will be doing a bad thing, whether or not it is for good motives. Nevertheless, practical difficulties exist when it comes to implementing rules on discrimination. In schools of a particular religious ethos, for example, the management and board of governors will be minded to ensure that those who are responsible for religious teaching should be actively involved in the relevant faith. Clearly, that is what the articles provide for; that is not a matter of dispute. It will be perfectly possible for someone who teaches religion in a Catholic school to be a Catholic, and for the recruitment procedures to insist on that person being a Catholic. The same will apply to any other religious denomination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not possible that the best candidate might not be Catholic? Why should such people not be eligible for posts in Catholic schools simply on the basis of their parents' religion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. In teaching a subject, it is not always necessary to believe in what you are teaching. One can teach from a position of objectivity. As a scientist—I know that the hon. Gentleman is a general practitioner, so I shall loosely include him as a scientist—one frequently has to teach theories that one does not hold. When the theory is a matter of debate, and the evidence does not weigh strongly one way or the other, it is taught from a position of objectivity, and it is possible that one teaches the better for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a governor of a Church of England school—despite having been brought up as a Catholic—and I would look for objectivity as the prime requirement in anyone whom I appointed. Nevertheless,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0926">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
I can understand the fear of those who read this framework directive and feel that they may not be able to make a judgment about the best person to teach children in a school, because they will be limited by the provisions. My understanding is that the articles will allow discrimination on the basis of religion in relation to the teaching or passing on of religious information. However, that is under question in relation to ancillary posts. Many Christian organisations argue that one professes one's faith, in a number of different ways, through one's ordinary day-to-day existence and the way in which one carries out one's duties. Such organisations would argue that even an administrative position within a school should be filled by someone who follows the tenets of the faith, in order to demonstrate, in a practical way, what it means to follow that religion. Clearly, the articles do not precisely describe how that will be dealt with in the future. If I were forced to judge the way in which the articles are pushing us, I would incline towards the argument that they would prevent discrimination on religious grounds under such circumstances. That would concern people who hold clear the tenets of a faith and want to see that faith throughout their organisations and schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can suggest only one solution. Were the Government to introduce legislation in this country on practices in the workplace, we would first undertake expensive consultation with the people who would implement them. There has been no discussion about practicality with religious organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman give any weight, if not equal weight, to the hundreds of thousands of teachers who might want to teach religious education and would be good at it—that is the prime objective—but who would be in danger of losing their jobs if it were made clear in some document that church schools funded by the taxpayer were entitled to sack people for not going to church five times in any three-month period? Do they not have a right to be consulted and to have their interests maintained?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. All people have rights. Discrimination is bad, and bad things do not become good because good people do them. We need a framework from which we can implement legislation against discrimination that is as thorough as the articles, but that meets the practical concerns of those currently working in religious organisations. From experience, I do not believe that consultation in search of a practical route has yet been carried out as thoroughly as I would like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, especially as he talks about practicality. As a Jew, I declare an interest. Does he believe that a Jewish school that serves kosher food should be obliged to employ people, including as caterers, who are non-Jewish? That would cause grave offence to many Jewish people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I understand that one has to follow the faith to prepare kosher food. According to the articles, that would be a legitimate reason to appoint a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
Jew to such a position. In the same way, one needs to be a Muslim and to understand the rules of that faith to prepare halal food.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished by this exchange. I do not feel that it is an interest to declare, but I am also Jewish, and I can tell both hon. Gentlemen that kosher food is produced, sold, transported and manufactured by people adhering to a set of regulations. The religion of their mothers is irrelevant to their ability to carry out the job. I worry when I hear hon. Members suggesting that legislation is bad unless a religious organisation is satisfied on whatever it wants. We must accept that some people will not be satisfied by legislation, and we must not go out of our way to ensure that they are satisfied at the expense of many people who simply want to do jobs at which they are good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman corrects me, and I shall take his word for it. I am not Jewish. I was under the impression that one had to be Jewish to produce kosher food. If that is not so, it would not be covered by the articles, so it would be proper for a Christian or anyone else to apply for and be given equal consideration for the hypothetical job proposed by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow). That is fine.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was making the simple point—obviously not to the satisfaction of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, who clearly needs longer than 15 minutes to vote-that, when implementing proposals relating to how conditions at work are to be judged and implemented, it is usual first to go through an extensive consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne McIntosh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need the directive to make it a practical reality that the single market offers free movement of people and labour throughout the European Union. We have established the need for legislation that deals equally throughout the European Union on matters of discrimination. The directive does not provide for equal treatment throughout the European Union, but for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0927">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
a baseline in each country. For very much the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble outlined, if different regulations are available in each country, employers will take advantage and will always want to use proposals in the countries that provide the lowest common denominator. If we believe that discrimination is wrong and that people should have the freedom to work and to contribute throughout the European Union, it is appropriate to have legislation that guarantees that in each country. That is as much in our interests as it is in the interests of employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Members for Vale of York and for Buckingham that, when we explain to our constituents what the European Union is attempting to achieve, the one aspect that people usually agree with is the principle of free movement of people and labour. My constituents consider that that is a practical advantage for them. Some people do not understand the meaning of a single market, but they know what it means to be able to move wherever they want to and to be able to ply their trade wherever they want to do so. They believe that that is freedom and a principle that the European Union gives them. That is what the initiative is attempting to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain the difference in principle between a level playing field in anti-discrimination legislation and a level playing field in taxation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could do so, but Mr. Gale would immediately call me to order because it would be inappropriate to refer to such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initiative is intended to establish a level playing field in respect of discrimination. Its practical implementation is vital. From my consultations with religious organisations and others I do not believe that thorough consultation has yet been concluded. That is why the Government are right to say to the European Union that they will not buy into such a policy until they see the final text and have had time to think about the way in which it will be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite an example of why I believe that such action is necessary. When I asked my right hon. Friend the Minister whether the directive would apply to political parties, she took the view that it did not. I ask her to read it again, because I think that it will apply to political parties, as it clearly states that one cannot discriminate on grounds of beliefs. I do not know what has happened to the beliefs of political parties, if that does not apply to them. I certainly take the view that an organisation that is recruiting needs a code of conduct and a framework for the beliefs that guide its principles, so that it can defend itself against accusations that it has been discriminatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to article 9, which concerns the burden of proof. After one has established that there has been unequal treatment, the burden of proof falls on the defendant, which must prove that the organisation is not discriminatory. Organisations will be able to defend themselves against charges of discrimination only by producing policy, frameworks that clearly state the way in which they will operate, take decisions and make judgments, so that they can demonstrate in Court that they have followed those frameworks. Have there been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
any discussions with political parties or religious organisation, such as Christian churches, about what such a body of policies should constitute and how it will be judged and implemented in order to make a defence against such charges?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initiative is important and may contribute a great deal to the benefits that we as a nation and a people obtain from the European Union. However, it will do that only if we understand the practicalities of its implementation. For that reason, I strongly urge the Government to insist on a thorough review of the detailed documentation, when it is produced. We should take the time and opportunity to discuss that detail with relevant organisations before making the final decision about whether to implement the directive. The motion is right: we should take note of the document today and go on to engage in detailed discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not speak for as long as the hon. Member for Buckingham, because other people also want to speak. In a short time, one cannot do justice to the complex issues raised by the proposed legislation. As a preface to my first question, I mentioned that I am an honorary associate of the National Secular Society, and I speak on that basis from the Back Benches. However, as I am speaking from the Front Bench today, I will restrict my remarks to the views that will be put by the Liberal Democrats when the directive passes through its legislative stages. I refer hon. Members to the excellent contributions made by Lord Wallace of Saltaire and Lord Lester, in the House of Lords on 30 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats warmly welcome the approach of the European Union, and the rights included in the Amsterdam treaty. We want those rights and protections against discrimination to be implemented in this country as quickly as possible. We do not want slowness, and we are worried about the Government's approach in that respect. We do not want those rights to be watered down, as Baroness Blackstone, in the House of Lords on 30 June, intimated that they might be, with reference to article 4. We want the Government to recognise that their record on some of the matters that we are discussing has not been in keeping with the traditions of the Labour party, or with the commitment that they made in their manifesto.
	<br><blockquote><p>to seek to end unjustifiable discrimination wherever it exists.</p></blockquote>
More unjustifiable discrimination still takes place in Britain and the Government have missed opportunities to address that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Buckingham for giving me the opportunity to intervene during his speech. I have a few more words to say about his performance—I think that that is the best word to describe it. It is a pity that Conservative spokespeople so often use significant issues to have a bash at the European Union, particularly in regard to matters that are consequent on membership of the EU and on treaties that the previous Government supported. That is opposition it is of the worst kind though I accept that the hon. Member for Buckingham practises that skill to great effect, even if it does not move

us forward. Why does he believe that great care should be taken to ensure freedom of movement for goods and services, but that it is not necessary to provide the same liberties to mere human beings? It is as if he puts widgets before women. He will have to explain to the people in his constituency who suffer age discrimination what he is doing actively to bring about, as quickly as possible, a ban on age discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows that not long ago—within the past couple of years—I spoke at Stowe school in his constituency. The taxi driver who drove me from the school to my next destination told me that he was unable, at the age of 48, to get another job in insurance, his previous profession. He was not allowed even to apply for many vacancies because of his age. I urged him to write to his Member of Parliament about that; if he did so, I am sure that the assiduous hon. Member for Buckingham would have replied. The Government will have to account to such people and explain why, after four or five years in office, they still have given them no protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed that the Minister defended her Government's record in voting against a measure to outlaw sexual discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation by saying that it was important not to legislate on such matters in haste. Commendably, the Government recently legislated, for Northern Ireland, to ensure that protection from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. That was done quickly—much more quickly than the Government envisage giving protection against age discrimination—but it was done carefully and appropriately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's remarks closely. Is he confirming his disagreement with Stonewall on its advocacy of a code of practice on discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation? Is he saying that that demand is inadequate, that he rejects it and that he insists on legislation now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I discuss that issue with Stonewall regularly. As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, when my colleagues and I tabled an amendment to the Employment Relations Bill, Stonewall published a circular welcoming it. Some Labour Members—the hon. Member for South Ribble may have been one—challenged their Whips and refused to vote against that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of Government willingness to legislate, a code of practice is better than nothing. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman did not mean his question as a trick question—I did not in any case find it tricky. We would have liked Britain to have had taken action in respect of human rights and not to have to wait for Europe to ensure that such legislation is promulgated in this country. The feeling remains that on all matters of equal rights—particularly rights for those minorities that are not popular with the tabloid press—the Government prefer to wait to be forced to do something by the European Union or the European Court of Human Rights than to legislate themselves. The Minister knows well that that applies, on any objective measure, to the issue of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
gays and lesbians in the armed forces. The Government continued to discriminate even though they knew that they were bound to lose a case eventually. Many people lost their livelihoods and careers. The Government were in a position to reject unjustifiable discrimination, but changed the rules only when forced to by a European court judgment. How many people have to suffer before the Government prioritise the issue, as they have rightly prioritised racial discrimination in racially motivated crimes? The victims see no difference between the crimes, and people who promulgate such crimes see no difference between various minorities. The Government have a lot to answer for on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's approach to age discrimination also raises many questions. A Bill to outlaw age discrimination in job advertisements had a great deal to do with employment and training legislation, which is the remit of the proposed directive and the Minister's Department. That was talked out at the Dispatch Box by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, despite having been promoted by his own Back Benchers. I hope that the directive will outlaw discrimination in job advertisements. It will not be before time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the Government's desire to water down the directive. Baroness Blackstone said:
	<br><blockquote><p>it should be acceptable for a Church school to be able to require a teacher to be an active member of the Church in question. We shall press for amendments to the directive to ensure that there is no question of religious organisations being forced to employ people who are not members of the relevant faith, because that would dilute the maintenance of a distinctive religious ethos.—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 30 June 2000; Vol. 614, c. 1238.]</p></blockquote>
That is a dramatic statement. The implication is that it would apply to school secretaries, caretakers, cleaners and maths teachers—indeed, teachers of any subject—regardless of the bearing of their religion on their ability to do the job. If the Minister is going to respond to anything I say, I want her to make it clear what Baroness Blackstone meant by watering down the protections offered by the directive and expanding the exemptions in article 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some organisations are concerned that they will no longer be able to discriminate. The hon. Member for South Thanet said that unjustifiable discrimination by good people for a good cause was still bad. I agree with the principle behind that. Thousands of people who work in Church schools or for charities that are partially funded by religious organisations do not share the faith of that school or organisation, or, if they do, are not active in it. They must quiver with fear of losing their jobs. Although there might be no protection now, if the Government actively introduce amendments and relax the proposals, the fact that people have been in those jobs for years and are the best people for them will mean nothing to those organisations unless they have had their posteriors on pews often enough. I do not mean to be disparaging; that is clearly an important facet of a religion. However, many parents ensure that they are seen in church regularly so that they get a certificate from the vicar to qualify their child for entry to a Church school because that is their preferred school. I question whether we should go further down that road. My colleagues in the other place were worried about Baroness Blackstone's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0929">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
The fundamental consideration when deciding whether someone is suitable for a job is that person's ability to do it. I am not arguing that the prime concern should be objectivity. People who are not objective, are still able to do a good job if their teaching is objective. I would give a good performance at teaching something that I did not go along with. Hon. Members do it all the time. Our voting records show that we often practise what we do not preach. What matters in schools is whether people are good at their jobs. Examining people's personal belief systems and personal conduct can only lead to disaster. It seems strange that some organisations wish to discriminate against people on the basis of whether their life partner is of the same or opposite gender. If the question were whether those employed by church schools were adulterous, it would be a major concern. It is often said—I am not sure that I necessarily accept it—that if certain churches could, at a stroke, get rid of all the priests who were not heterosexual, there would be quite a few empty pulpits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful before we allow discrimination against people, except on the basis of their ability to do the job. Doing a job is not about who one is, but about what one does and how well one does it. There is a fundamental problem with any further watering down of that proposal. The Prime Minister indicated in a recent speech that he wished to see more faith schools, and there is a danger that we will head down a path that has—I think of Northern Ireland—caused difficulties. The more inclusive we can make our job market, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much more that I could say, but I want to leave time for other hon. Members. I want the Minister to be quite clear about how far she would allow the watering down of rights and the expansion of the exemption in article 4. Could she tell us when she thinks that it will reasonable to introduce protections? If one asks people in the lesbian and gay community what single right they most want—this is unscientific but it would be generally accepted—it is the right not to suffer discrimination in the workplace. That is even more important than other rights relating to the criminal law. Polls have shown that a majority of lesbian and gay workers are discriminated against in the workplace. They are harassed, not promoted, and their lives are made a misery. There is currently no protection in this country. That is an outrage. The sooner the Government either bring in their own legislation or allow this directive to come into law, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.52 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, generally welcome the directive. I should like to thank the European Scrutiny Committee for choosing the debate. The subject is important and needs further consideration. A debate like this could easily take a day on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of a general framework in respect of the principles of equal treatment between persons, irrespective of race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation within the European Union is sound. Most hon. Members would sign up to it. There is a lot of work to be done on the directive, but it is not clear, but must be if it is to be effective. It is, admittedly, a framework document, but my experience of EU law, particularly in employment, is that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
interpretation of laws in different countries and the precedent that follows often affect other countries. It is sometimes difficult to follow. When we are making an important step forward in discrimination law, it helps if it is clear so that our subsequent laws can follow it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
UK legislation already covers' equal pay, disability discrimination and race relations, which are covered by this directive. Other countries have some catching up to do. In other areas, such as age discrimination, we have not gone far enough. I appreciate that debate has continued in the House for a number of years. We have talked about Back-Bench legislation through private Member's Bills. My hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) introduced a Bill a few years ago and received some support in the House, and there is support around the country now. Opposition Members have tabled similar legislation, which also received support. It is disappointing that the Government have not yet taken up the cudgel, as they should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with interpretation given by the hon. Member for Buckingham of the EU position. He examined it from a constitutional viewpoint and questioned whether it was right, in terms of subsidiarity and proportionality, for Europe to proceed. I believe that it is. There is precedent for that and widespread agreement throughout Europe. Legislatures are generally falling behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some interesting statistics on age groups in employment were published in a European review last year. The report estimates that between 1995 and 2015, the number of people in the 20–29 age group will fall by 11 million, which is 20 per cent.—a significant shift in the demographics of the European population. As a result of economic cycles in this country and Europe more widely, there is a move away from employment during old age. People are retiring younger. Those two movements are out of kilter. Apart from the discrimination aspects, there are sound economic arguments for ensuring that we lead the way in tackling age discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be nice to have legislation in place overnight, but the Government are right to say that a two-year time scale may be too soon to change the culture. It is important that this House sends out a message—and it should be voiced throughout Europe—that employers should wise up to the issues. I refer not just to the practical management of older people in employment and the skills and services that they can contribute to businesses. I mean that it is in the economic interests of employers to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is dealing with age discrimination, but sex discrimination is another important issue. Does he agree with the chief constable of the south Wales police, Mr. Antony Burden, that the change in the burden of proof in relation to sex discrimination cases from the year 2001 could open up an avenue of expensive litigation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Legislation in this sphere is expensive, but we have to weigh the balance, I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. It is important to shift the burden of proof, especially in employment cases. An employee plaintiff
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0930">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
pursuing a case in court is likely to be at a disadvantage. The employer has the odds in his favour in relation to obtaining evidence. I rest my case on natural justice, which supports shifting the burden of proof in such cases. It can be done sensitively, which is why we must be clear about what we intend to achieve. Consultation is important. If we get the balance right, it will not place an unfair burden on employers, but will offer people the right way to pursue just causes. They should have the armoury to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, article 5 does not provide a sound basis for the necessary legislation and I hope that the Government will examine it further and improve it. I have dwelt on age discrimination because I know that other hon. Members have dealt with other aspects of the treaty and we should spend some time on age discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 as drafted is insufficient and unhelpful, but it can be improved. My worry is that there seems to be an unnecessary urgency about the matter; if it is rushed through without our getting it right, it will not deliver what is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the principles of the treaty are right. Article 8, which refers to defence rights is also important. In a question to the Minister, I said that if the rights are to be subject to legislation, we must ensure that the plaintiff and the defendants have rights of access to the courts; the community legal service needs to be improved in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received representations from my constituency about the genuine occupational qualification. A minister wrote to me and as well as making complimentary remarks about the Government, which I am always pleased to hear, he said that he was concerned about the new European Union employment directive which he understands will make it illegal for a church to require Christian staff to fill church posts. He understands that the Goveniment are supporting the measure. He is grateful for the exemption for clergy and religious education teachers in schools but he thinks that there may still be problems if, for instance, he wishes to employ'a church youth worker who may be an atheist. I understand that point. My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet also raised the matter, about which there clearly are concerns. We need to spend time to get the framework right to ensure that the measure can be interpreted not only by lawyers but by those who have to conduct their organisations in accordance with the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support those hon. Members who have mentioned anxieties about the religious aspects of the proposal. I, too, have received written representations and I endorse requests that the Minister should undertake comprehensive consultation because clearly there is anxiety, a lack of clarity and a great deal more work to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham correctly questioned the justification for the Commission initiating law in this area. One problem with the way in which the European Community works is that we are not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
allowed to know before the Commission acts what individual member states would have required. In many cases, member states might not have wished the matter to be the subject of trans-European legislation; when I asked my hon. Friend about article 13, my eye was taken by paragraph 3.1 of the European Community's explanatory memorandum which points out that in addition to article 13 justifying action in the matter, article 5 states that the community must act only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take a slightly different view of European matters from my hon. Friend and would always ask whether action was justified. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York asked earlier from a sedentary position whether it was justified in this case. The Commission a body acquisitive for power—that is why it exists. Sometimes it cannot see the wood for the trees. The Minister has not jusitified her assertion that what other member states are doing is wrong. We need to act in a concerted manner across the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I must say no, because I have only a few minutes before the Minister replies. The explanatory memorandum goes on to talk about the proposed action being better achieved by the community by reason of scale or effect. It has not been shown that a less difficult way to approach this tortuous subject might have been an accord at a European Council saying that member states should use their best endeavours in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had more time, I would explain in considerable detail the remarks made by Baroness Blackstone in a debate of the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee. She gave a good analysis of the practical difficulties that the directive would create and asked many questions about the directive's clarity, purpose, necessity and content, which helped me to understand why the Government tabled the motion. Having started off with the House of Lords report and the directive, I was glad when I read Baroness Blackstone's remarks, because I then found out the Government's position. They are about as sceptical as we are about many of the practical measures. This is real lawyer's territory. If the legislation is passed, it will start an amazing series of pan-European cases, as people probe and winkle out differences across the European community, comparing and contrasting national legislation with European legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For Parliament's sake, the justification for giving the directive our best wishes should be much clearer. I am against unnecessary discrimination. A person's ability to do a job should be the paramount determinant, but many difficult issues have been raised. The most important is lack of justification, and perhaps the Minister will address that. I agree that this is a matter to which Parliament should return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal in the small amount of time remaining with arguments about the treaty base and subsidiarity. The justification for a framework directive
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0931">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
is that the European Union should act only if the action cannot be achieved by member states. That is important. There is a clear treaty base in article 13 for the directive under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I accept the point made by several hon. Members that, in negotiating the directive, it is important that it remains a framework directive that sets minimum standards, rather than becoming a prescriptive substitute for domestic law. We are trying to achieve that balance in our negotiations. It might be helpful for hon. Members to know that the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee and all those who gave evidence to the House of Lords inquiry agreed that the proposals met the tests of subsidiarity and proportionality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham mentioned the code of practice on sexual orientation. I hope that the status of the code is clear: the Equal Opportunities Commission is preparing it, at the request of Ministers from the Department for Education and Employment. Discussions have taken place with the CBI and other interested parties. That work will be published sometime next year. The hon. Gentleman's remarks suggest that it will receive a warm cross-party welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend refers to the consultations taking place on the code of practice. Are her Department or the Equal Opportunities Commission consulting the various faith groups on the way in which such a code would impact on schools and other religious organisations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to raise that point on my hon. Friend's behalf with the Equal Opportunities Commission, which is compiling the code.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have very little time and I am keen to go through all the points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet asked whether "beliefs" includes political beliefs. That is a good example of the need for greater clarity in the drafting of the directive. Clearly it is not intended that the directive should extend to political beliefs but my hon. Friend was right to make the point, which he did so elegantly. Beliefs in this context are religious beliefs. My hon. Friend rightly said that we must ensure proper consultation on the way in which the provisions will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members repeated the point about the position of Church schools. Essentially we seek to negotiate the status quo. I want to make it clear that that means that church schools will have the freedom to recruit whoever they wish but that there will be provision and protection in law to recruit teachers who are of the common faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In maintaining the status quo for that aspect of church schools, will the Government take care to ensure that religious freedom is not used to discriminate on other grounds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped that I had made it clear that the intention is to apply the provisions pertaining to Church schools, not to provide a cover for bigotry. That will be clearly expressed through the remaining negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to remarks made by my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone in another place which were intended to convey the point that I have just made, which is that the aim of the provisions relating to religious discrimination is to preserve the status quo as represented by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a full and thoughtful debate on the directive. The "moderate Euro-realist" suggested that we are racing to sign a directive regardless, while the Liberal Democrats suggested that we are dragging our feet. We shall do what is right and we shall negotiate in the full determination that the directive will be able to pass into domestic law.
