Environmental Liability White Paper</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><i>[Relevant Documents: European Union Document No. 6055/00, a Commission Communication on the precautionary principle.]</i></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Sayeed. The circumstances in which we come to the Committee could not be allowed to pass without someone registering the strongest possible protest that we are in a Standing Committee rather than on the Floor of the House. A properly constituted quorum of the Select Committee on European Scrutiny decided unequivocally last week the matter should be taken on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
There seems to be complete contempt for the proceedings of the House. At least the Minister of State has been prepared to come to the Committee, which suggests that the Government acknowledge that the matter is important. When the European Scrutiny Committee decides that a matter should be taken on the Floor of the House, it is because it has deemed that the matter is of legal and political importance, and that all hon. Members have the right to examine in open forum the questions arising from it. We need not compare the merits or demerits of that form of debate compared with a Committee such as this. That right is being denied to the House as a whole.<br><br>
True, any hon. Member can attend the Committee, but it is clear that, in the real world, there has been an abuse of the system. The way in which the Leader of the House treated the matter at business questions last week, simply announcing that the subject would be debated in Standing Committee, was outrageous. The European Scrutiny Committee is one of the few Committees to enable the House properly to consider matters in line with an all-party Committee recommendation. In that, it is like the Select Committee on Public Accounts. It must follow that, if the Committee says that the Floor of the House is the right forum, that should be the forum.<br><br>
Convention or political gerrymandering might be a factor. Political gerrymandering has occurred here—the Government do not want the matter to be debated properly on the Floor of the House. As we will discover, an important question arises regarding biotechnology, GM foods, toxic solid waste and the polluter pays principle. The bottom line is that it is a disgrace that the matter is being taken before a Standing Committee.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point but it is not a point of order and is not for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unless you rule otherwise, Mr. Sayeed, it might be useful for me to respond briefly to the point made by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would rather that the Minister did not do that because time is limited.</span></p>
<p>10.32 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Committee for the opportunity to debate an important subject. I take account of your ordinance, Mr. Sayeed, on the point of order of the hon. Member for Stone, but I am sure that today's debate represents an opening shot in what will be extensive discussion of a highly technical and detailed issue. The Government do not intend to deny hon. Members a full opportunity to make their views known on the difficult area of environmental liability. I was asked to come to the Committee and I have responded. Of course, I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the request that the matter be taken on the Floor of the House, but we are at the scrutiny stage and there will be a later stage. The question of genetically modified organism liability will undoubtedly return for debate on the Floor of the House, as we want it to.<br><br>
I am grateful for the Committee's report on the document and on our explanatory memorandum. I am also grateful for its highly pertinent questions, on which we have provided a supplementary memorandum dated 5 June, on which it has also reported. As the Committee said, the White Paper is a significant document that raises a host of issues, both political and legal. It stems from a decision made three years ago by the previous Commission, which in turn followed various earlier proposals for EC action in this area that did not come to fruition. The fact that it did not succeed is perhaps a measure of the difficulty of the subject. The main aim of any environmental liability regime is to make the causer of environmental damage pay for remedying that damage, in line with the polluter pays principle, which, as I understand it, is universally supported. In turn, any such regime should encourage greater prevention and precaution, in line with that important principle. The White Paper explores ideas for a regime across the European Union by setting out various options and outlining elements and features that such a regime might include.<br><br>
The White Paper concludes that the most appropriate action for the Community is a framework directive, which would provide for strict liability for environmental damage that takes the form of contaminated sites, damage to biodiversity and traditional damage—that is, harm to persons or property—when such damage is caused by particular EC-regulated dangerous activities. It would also provide fault-based liability for damage to biodiversity that is caused by non-dangerous activities. The White Paper proposes to make the operator of the relevant activity the liable party.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0720">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
The White Paper argues that retrospection should be avoided so that only damage that occurs after the entry into force of the EU regime would be caught. Member states should be under a duty to secure remediation of the damage in cases that involve a liable polluter. If the state fails to act or does not act properly, public interest groups should have the right to judicial review and perhaps to sue the party that is responsible for the damage. The White Paper also suggests that public interest groups should have a power to obtain an injunction from the courts in order to prevent damage from occurring, a power to take preventive steps in urgent cases and an entitlement to recover their costs from the party that is responsible for the damage. It discusses alleviation of the plaintiffs burden of proof and possible defences.<br><br>
As we noted in our explanatory memorandum, the United Kingdom has a variety of regimes, measures and proposals in its domestic law on these matters, in which the concept of environmental liability is already widely applied. For example, we have just introduced in England a new statutory regime for dealing with contaminated land, which places liability for its remediation firmly on the polluter in the first instance. Last year, we improved the regime for dealing with water and groundwater pollution and introduced a new system of works notices to get such damage put right. The Countryside and Rights of Way Bill, which is currently passing through the House, includes provision to better secure the remediation of damage to sites of special scientific interest by those responsible. In addition to those public law measures, there is also private law, under which people whose interests are directly affected by a case of damage may be able to pursue a claim in the courts for compensation under various torts. Public interest groups can establish standing before the courts in relation to judicial review, and the Government are considering the question of representative actions.<br><br>
We have systems already, and we can understand the desire to explore arrangements at the EU level, where we know that there are certain gaps. One of the main issues is exactly how EC proposals relate to what we already have, what the costs and benefits of changes would be, and what objectives we want to achieve. I would be the first to recognise that that is not an easy area in which to arrive at quick answers. In fact, the White Paper raises more questions than it answers. We are currently assessing the reactions to our consultations with various interested parties, and preparing a response to the European Commission.<br><br>
From the initial response, our views will develop as we further explore the proposals and their implications, and as the Commission itself refines and develops its thinking from the fairly broadly expressed ideas in its White Paper. A full regulatory impact assessment will be needed. A draft directive would be the subject of intensive negotiation and debate, both domestically—I am sure that it will be debated on the Floor of the House—and throughout the European Union, which could take a number of years.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
That is the background to the proceedings. The Committee's views and questions, and this morning's debate, will be fully taken on board in our further deliberations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the brevity of his statement on this complex issue. I remind the Committee that questions should be brief, succinct and asked one at a time. In that way, each hon. Member will be able to ask a number of questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Loughton <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Worthing and Shoreham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that this is an important subject. I agree also with my hon. Friend the Member for Stone that the subject should have been dealt with on the Floor of the House. As a result, we have a great many questions.<br><br>
First, the White Paper originates from a European Parliament request made in 1994, which was debated by the European Commission in 1997. Only three years later it resulted in a White Paper, yet I understand that the European Commission hopes to issue a directive by the end of the year. That seems unduly hasty, because, as the Minister admitted, the White Paper raises many more questions than it answers. The Minister's memorandum is littered with complaints about its vagueness and the doubts that it raises. What is the Minister's view of the time scale, and is his Department pressing the European Commission to think about the matter over a longer period?<br><br>
Secondly, the Minister outlined a great many pieces of United Kingdom legislation on environmental protection. The White Paper attacks the principle of subsidiarity. What does the Minister think that the UK might be doing wrong that could be remedied by a European-wide directive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not quite right about the time scale. The proposal is that a draft directive should be prepared by the end of next year, not the end of this year, so we have another 18 months. I accept that even that much time is tight, bearing in mind that it is an extremely complex and legalistic matter. However, it has been under discussion for 10 years. Indeed, it was a request of the European Parliament that a horizontal directive that covered all aspects of environmental damage should be presented by the Commission by the end of 2001. Mrs. Margot Wallström, the EU Environment Commissioner, has firmly agreed to do that.<br><br>
On subsidiarity, the exact relationship between current UK law and proposed EU law is one of the matters to be considered. There are many detailed differences. I do not want my answers to be lengthy, but I shall spell out specific differences if I am asked to do so. It is for member states to agree directives. They exist only when there is agreement. As with all environment legislation, they are determined on the basis of qualified majority voting. There was considerable political support at the March Environment Council, but I am sure that countries, such as the United Kingdom, which registered strong, well prepared and well documented objections, will have those taken into account. Where one draws the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0721">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
line between leaving matters to domestic regimes rather than to an across-the-board EU regime is something on which we need to settle a view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawrie Quinn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend pointed out that the White Paper raises many issues. As the proposals will have an impact on small and medium enterprises, will he outline the consultation that his Department proposes with SMEs, which will form a basis of representations on this matter, which is important to many of my constituents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the significance of my hon. Friend's question. The burden on enterprises, including SMEs, which have the least resources, is important. However, they might be victims of environmental damage that is caused by another party, so a form of redress is possibly more important to them than it is to larger companies. We must look at the matter from both sides.<br><br>
We wrote to 140 organisations in March, and we have received about 40 replies. We took account of the views of large organisations such as the CBI, the Association of British Insurers and relevant technical bodies, including the UK Environmental Law Association, but we also had regard to the opinions of a number of smaller companies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister to the Committee, but this is not always the best place to take an opening shot at such documents. It might be better to have a wider debate in the House and to involve the public. As he said, the White Paper contains more questions than answers, so is it the most appropriate vehicle for the measure? What is the timetable for assessing responses? When will the Government reply to the Commission, because that might be the time to have a wider debate in the House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whether it is appropriate that the measure should be in a White Paper is a matter for communication, as it is called in EU jargon. That is for the European authorities to determine. We would say in this country that it has significant green edges.<br><br>
On whether it is appropriate to start the debate in this Committee, there is an argument—given the technicality and complexity of the issue—that the measure should be considered in a relatively specialist committee that will make its views known to the House for broader debate. That is sensible.<br><br>
As for when we will make our responses available, we are developing our case on all European Parliament amendments on Second Reading. The deadline for responses is July, which is when the conciliation process on this difficult matter will proceed. We will feed our position on the White Paper into the Council process at that time. That procedure will go on throughout the year. It is not timed for the immediate post-July period only.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the CBI. It said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<br><blockquote><p>The White Paper does not make the case that legislative action at EU level would add value beyond that available from environmental regulations and national tort law.</p></blockquote>
Could the Minister give three examples where the EU holds more competence in the area than national authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument is not that the EU is more competent, rather that gaps exist at the EU level. The polluter pays principle, which the CBI and everyone else supports, and the precautionary principle, should be applied universally across the EU. Our economic interests are now so entangled that United Kingdom companies in other member states could suffer the consequences of environmental damage and not have an appropriate form of redress. Differences of view exist, for example, on biodiversity damage and contaminated sites, and on the process-whether there should be changes in the burden of proof, some alleviation for the plaintiff or some possible liability for permitting authorities. The issues are serious and the Government have strong views on them, which we will put forward. We are keen that the rules apply not only in the United Kingdom, but throughout the European Union, where we carry out much of our trade.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's reference to the precautionary principle. That principle will be at the root of many of our discussions in the coming months. Does he agree that decisions made on the basis of the precautionary principle are often interpreted as trade disputes-for example, in the case of Canadian and American beef? Does he agree that the precautionary principle is often seen as an excuse for trade protectionism?<br><br>
Secondly, is the Minister aware that, according to my calculations, 14 separate interpretations of the precautionary principle are outlined in treaties and non-treaties? We need to clarify the situation. The interpretations include the "do not worry about the scientific evidence and get on and do it" approach, which is applied in the case of mobile phones and cellular telephone base stations in terms of radio frequencies. Different interpretations exist in Switzerland, Italy, the United States and here. Does the Minister agree that we need a hard and fast discussion on the meaning of the precautionary principle?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree strongly with my hon. Friend. I was closely involved in the negotiations on the biosafety protocol in Montreal in January, which, for the first time, established the precautionary principle as a founding principle in terms of international trade. However, having achieved agreement, the next problem is application. My view, which I have suggested to my opposite number in the United States, is that we need an international protocol about the manner in which the precautionary principle is exercised. My American opposite number strongly disagreed with the idea and, in the course of the negotiations, asked me whether it was a matter of religion or emotion. The appropriate response was no.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0722">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
The protocol on the manner in which the precautionary principle is exercised should establish a clear set of criteria that must be met before the precautionary principle can be exercised. That would cover assurances that all relevant evidence has been taken into account and that any new evidential gap will be closed, and that the application is consistent, coherent and non-discriminatory. A detailed protocol is the appropriate way to proceed, otherwise, the exercise of the precautionary principle becomes a trade dispute.<br><br>
We can have free and open trade—which I personally support—that is consistent with the protection of the environment. Given that international good will is not a certainty, that interface needs to be clearly defined. Under the biosafety protocol, the parties must meet in the next four years to reach agreement about a liability regime. That will certainly have to take account of the application of precautionary principles under the protocol.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question concerning changes to the law referred to by the Minister is obviously crucial to our consideration of the White Paper and any future directive. The Secretary of State has conceded that, in the context of the draft directive, qualified majority voting would apply. Fundamental differences clearly arise with respect to the 1993 Lugano convention, which the previous Government, and, at this juncture, present Government, have not signed, because of the changes with respect to the burden of proof and other matters outlined in the papers.<br><br>
An extremely difficult question arises. How, after such lengthy discussions, will the Secretary of State be able to prevent the other countries from using qualified majority voting, other than by using the veto? His memorandum notes the suggestion that
<br><blockquote><p>the Community regime could also contain one or other form of alleviation of the traditional burden of proof, to be more precisely defined at a later stage,</p></blockquote>
and responds:
<br><blockquote><p>It is clear that any such suggestion could not be left to be settled at a later stage.</p></blockquote>
After becoming locked into the draft directive-when confronted by the question at the heart of the liability issue and by qualified majority voting, one is locked in and locked out-how will the Minister respond, in law and in practice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Lugano convention, which, as is explained in the supplementary memorandum, is the Council of Europe's convention on civil liability for damage resulting from activities dangerous to the environment. The previous Government did not sign it, because they considered it tp be of no obvious benefit to United Kingdom law. Even if it would have been of benefit, they considered it so loosely drafted as not to merit signing. The present Government have not signed either, and do not propose to do so.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
The hon. Gentleman, whose views on Europe are well known, takes the view that any intrusion into the existing United Kingdom legal or administrative position is likely to be damaging or unhelpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it would be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not automatically take that view. Many issues of real concern arise, but the Government are strongly of the view that an environmental liability regime, applicable throughout Europe, is desirable, provided, of course, that the details are acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Including the burden of proof.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course. That is an important condition.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman particularly mentioned the alleviation of the burden of proof for the plaintiff. As the supplementary memorandum states, the problem of the plaintiff having to prove facts that are peculiarly in the mind or knowledge of the defendant is already recognised in the English doctrine of res ipsa loquitur—the matter speaks for itself. The doctrine applies where it is so improbable that the act in question would have happened without the negligence of the defendant that it is reasonable that the burden of proof should switch to the defendant. We also make reference in our memorandum to a case with which I am sure the Committee is familiar, of Alphacell <i>v.</i> Woodward in 1972. In that case, it was recognised that the onus placed on the prosecution to prove that pollution was caused intentionally or negligently by the defendant may sometimes be difficult, and that a lot of pollution may go unpunished. It is therefore reasonable to reconsider the matter. It would be wrong to worry that it is being done at a European level. My concern is that our major considerations should properly be taken into account. I obviously cannot guarantee now that they will, but we shall fight hard for it and I see no reason why it should not be the case. If so, there would be a net gain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Dobbin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Heywood and Middleton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Organisations such as the National Trust obviously have a great interest in the White Paper. The trust believes that a definition of environmental damage to natural resources should be included, referring to air, water and so on. To what extent can damage to natural resources be valued?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to an interesting aspect of the European White Paper, which is that past land contamination and water pollution is not covered. That is the result of non-retrospectivity, and one can understand the reason for that. However, our contamination regime, which came into force on 1 April 2000, provides for a person who causes or knowingly permits such contamination to be held to account, or, if not him, the owner or occupier. We may not be taking a harder line than the Commission, but we certainly take a more extensive view than the Commission of the need for reparation of environmental damage. As the authors of that regime,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0723">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
we obviously believe that we are right. It is a matter on which we should seek to persuade other member states.<br><br>
One of the problems with the White Paper is that, even if the EU excludes past pollution, we shall need a clear and workable cut-off point. The cumulative effects of long-lasting and pre-existing pollution will flow before and after whatever point in time is chosen. That issue is not answered in the White Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Brake <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following the question about definitions, I invite the Minister to define significant biodiversity damage. Will he seek to include a definition, or will he simply remove the word "significant" so that the provision would cover any damage to biodiversity? That is pertinent not only to this debate but to today's debates in the Chamber on the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. There are a number of gaps. Significant damage is not easy to define, as those of us who tried to decide what is meant by "significant" or "predominantly" in a different context discovered. However, the White Paper must provide for clear rules on concrete and quantifiable damage.<br><br>
Other relevant gaps are the definitions of due defence against charges of environmental damage; of valuation methods; of trigger thresholds; of standards for remediation; and of the burden of proof arrangements about which we have already talked. All those matters, not only what is meant by "significant", need to be much more clearly defined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Chaytor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify a couple of points on the constraints that are included in the White Paper? The first concerns EC-regulated activities. Will he give an example of a potentially polluting or contaminating process that is not an EC-regulated activity? Are some activities that could lead to damage to biodiversity outside the existing regulatory regime?<br><br>
The second part of my question relates to the sites that will be eligible for the protection that is provided by the regime and which will be covered by the liability requirements set out in the White Paper. Only sites that are listed in the habitats directive will be covered, so will the Minister confirm that the regime will not apply to marine pollution of any sort? For example, would the recent oil spill from a tanker just off the west coast of France have been included in the regime?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks, first, whether some forms of environmental damage are not currently regulated by the EU regime. I cannot immediately supply him with an answer. EU environmental regulation is extensive, but so is our legislation, which includes the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which, in turn, is supplemented by other Acts. Breaches of integrated pollution control and waste management controls are dealt with in that Act, as is contaminated land, damage caused by statutory nuisance and, significantly, harm from genetically modified organisms, which is dealt with in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
part VI of the Act. Pollution of controlled waters is covered by section 161 of the Water Resources Act 1991 and damage to biodiversity is dealt with in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The role of radioactivity is dealt with in the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. This country has a panoply of environmental legislation. I am not sure about the exact degree of overlap and whether some marginal areas fall outside EU-regulated activities, but I shall ensure that my hon. Friend receives an answer to that question. If there are any such areas, their number is small.<br><br>
Secondly, my hon. Friend asked whether the White Paper covered marine pollution. It does not. Again, that is a significant point, as pollution from oil leaks that arise after accidents has a severe impact on marine species. The lack of adequate or consistent rights of address under the habitats directive, for example, as opposed to the protection that could be provided by an across-the-board environmental EU damage regime, is a matter for concern. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that issue, which should be considered in the working group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The more that the Minister mentions the environment protection measures that were introduced by the previous Government, the more he makes a case against having any directive at all. On the question asked by the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor), does the Minister believe that the new directive overrides the habitats directive, especially in terms of its public interest allowances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, there is extensive EU environmental legislation. The Environmental Protection Act 1990 is a landmark Act, on whose countryside and biodiversity provisions we are now building in the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill. That does not mean that there is no benefit in ensuring that rules that are acceptable to us should not apply across the EU. Our economic interest can be affected by a failure to ensure such application, which is in our interests.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether an across-the-spectrum EU environmental regime would override the habitats directive. The framework directive has not been drawn up. I do not expect it to override existing directives, but to be consistent with them. However, I cannot give a conclusive answer until we see the actual terms of the framework directive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of another important strategic resource, water, does my right hon. Friend think that, in the light of recent national legislation, the issue of water abstraction and the significance of water in the future, it will be given special or unique consideration by the EU?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have examined the issue of water abstraction and issued consultative proposals. In the light of the responses that we received, we made it clear that we intend to proceed with those proposals. It is not necessary to have an EU-wide application of the rules. Water pollution,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0724">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
however, is another matter, especially because there is trans-boundary pollution. Although Britain is an island, many EU member states have problems because major rivers flow across their boundaries. The requirement that there should be agreed and standard rules about preventing pollution or remedying pollution when it has occurred is important. It is one of the most crucial parts of the proposed framework directive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister formed a view on the access to justice in paragraph 4.7 and the role of third parties in initiating legislation or judicial review? The National Farmers Union is concerned about the danger of vexatious litigation as a result of that access. Our experience of bovine spongiform encephalopathy has taught us to enforce a tight regulatory regime, but other countries in the EU are about to discover that they should have followed our lead sooner. Will third parties in other member states be able to initiate action if they believe that they have suffered a loss because another nation state has not enforced its environmental regulations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is, again, an important area, about which there is uncertainty. The White Paper proposes that public interest groups—notably environmental non-governmental organisations, but ad-hoc groups of residents or neighbours that have suffered damage might also be relevant—should have the right judicially to review public authorities for failing to take action against those who have caused or knowingly permitted environmental damage. That is the current position. However, there is the additional issue of whether public interest groups should have the right to initiate injunctions against an offending, or alleged to be offending, body that has caused the problem, or to take direct proceedings against an offending body rather instead of requiring the public authority to do so.<br><br>
Those are important questions on which we have not formed a final view. It would be a significant extension of current UK law if the latter two roles were extended to public interest groups. The British Government are considering permitting public interest groups to take representative actions, but allowing them to take out injunctions and directly to sue the offending party is another matter.<br><br>
On the matter of the NFU's concern about vexatious litigation, the White Paper contains a proposal that there should be a cross-undertaking on damages. In other words, if the plaintiff's case fails and an award is made on behalf of the defendant, the plaintiff must pay the defendant's costs. That would impose a significant check on rash claims.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise in defence of the genetically modified pollen grain because the GM debate has been used as an example in the issue that we are discussing. Has my right hon. Friend, who has become an expert on pollen grains overnight, any evidence that pollen grains alight on the female pistil of a plant 600m down the road? Why does he suggest that we should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
investigate the GM pollen crop and not organic pollen or pollen made from conventional crops, because that, too, could cause new genetic recombinants, mutations and new plants? That could cause contamination without GM being involved at all. In the interests of research, science and information, might it not be a good idea not to ostracise GM?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. It is true that the national debate has been fixated on the GM question. My hon. Friend is right that cross-pollination and new recombinant effects are not confined to GM crops, and that it would be right to consider the effects of organic and conventional pollen. The national pollen research unit has undertaken work in that area at the request of the Soil Association and others, and that has been n the main source of empirical data in this country during the past few years. The unit has produced evidence—I shall not say that it is disturbing, because it has been well understood for a long time—that a vast amount of pollen is deposited within a few yards of the plant and then, beyond that immediately adjacent location, there is a marked reduction in deposits until one reaches the traditional agronomic distance, whether that is 200m or 50m, beyond which very small amounts of pollen are deposited. My hon. Friend made the important point that the problem is not the existence of pollen per se, but the fact that it alights on the appropriate part of a receptive female flower and causes cross-pollination. However, in general, I agree that we should not restrict the debate to genetic modification because the wider results of cross-pollination need to be taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already stated that the EU is not especially competent in that area. The problem with the EU is its limited geographical area. A river such as the Danube goes in and out of EU and non-EU states. Would not bilateral agreements be a better solution to pollution problems in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not be so worried about European-wide regimes or so automatically fearful of them. I assure him that they are sometimes helpful, especially if we as partners in the EU have a major role in determining what is said. However, the hon. Gentleman is right; all those issues have been governed for a long time by bilateral regimes, and that will remain the case as long as certain countries affected by the same rivers are outside the EU. That does not invalidate the good sense of looking at the effectiveness of a European-wide environmental regime and considering the merits of the case to see whether, on balance, it would benefit us. In particular, we should consider whether we have any serious objections, with which we should insist on dealing before agreeing to the whole regime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chaytor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask a further question about the restrictions in the White Paper? As the Minister has already said, the proposals will not apply retrospectively. When a process has existed for several years and is alleged to have damaged a species or habitat, there might be a question of the cumulative
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0725">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
effect of that process over that period. However, it would be indisputable that the process, as currently carried out, was causing the damage. How would that situation be dealt with by the legislation? There is a retrospective dimension, even though the process is continuing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises one of the issues to which the White Paper does not provide an answer. It is for us, who are the partners in the process, to come up with our own solutions. There is not a cutoff point in the contaminated land regime that has just come into force in this country. One could argue that there should not be a cut-off point, although that would lead to difficult questions. If those who originally caused or knowingly permitted a contamination cannot be traced, no longer exist or have gone bankrupt, do others carry the accountability for past contamination for which they are not directly responsible? That problem is serious. One must either go down that route or decide on an inevitably arbitrary cut-off point with exactly the problems that my hon. Friend has raised. The issue is not resolved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brake</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister about site restoration. The White Paper proposes that damage to biodiversity should be restored. I would support that suggestion. Is the Minister confident that he has a sufficiently detailed picture of the current situation on sites throughout the country to establish the level to which a site would need to be restored if biodiversity damage had been caused?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the UK as opposed to other member states to be affected by the regime. Our knowledge of sites of special scientific interest is already pretty extensive. However, I agree that that knowledge is not complete and a desirable depth of understanding has not been reached. English Nature—the statutory adviser on such matters—has undertaken further work, particularly in regard to mineral workings. Mineral workings constitute deliberate economic activity as opposed to accidental, unintended damage. The body is considering further work at particular sites and then studying the generality of SSSIs. It will report to us this autumn.<br><br>
We need more information and are trying to obtain it. Again, that is not a reason for rejecting the EU-wide regime proposals. I am not saying that the hon. Gentleman was suggesting that we do that. Having such a regime prompts us to collect the information so that we can apply it properly, and that is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It fell to me to manage a major pollution incident on the banks of the Humber in my professional capacity before becoming an hon. Member. The situation had been caused by an accumulation of waste due to 20 years of fly tipping on British Railways Board land. The bank eroded and waste spilled into the estuary, causing a major incident. That led us, as part of our strategy for managing railway resources, to establish a database. Will the proposal not mean that all landowners,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
especially major landowners, will have to formulate a procedure to build a database, to keep good records and to protect their property from the possibility of third-party pollution caused by activities such as fly tipping?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the benefits of such a regime, whether UK-based or EU-based, is that it pressures potential offenders, who could find themselves liable to the regime's penalties, to take precautionary action. That major feature concerns insurance implications. One might take out insurance to protect oneself. Insurability is no doubt an important objective under the regime because insurers will want clear workable rules with basic standards. That is helpful. If the regime makes landowners or land managers pay more attention than they have previously to particular risks of environmental damage, that is a major gain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the situation as regards penalties? The document does not make it clear who will decide the extent of the liability of any company that is judged to have committed a breach, or the scale of any penalty. Is the penalty made up purely of a remedial cost, or is there a cost plus a fine? In the latter case, to whom does the fine go? As the potential penalties are unlimited and uncapped, is the Minister happy that this is a civil rather than a criminal offence, with all the European Court of Human Rights implications that go with that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong to think a fine is involved. The regime proposes remediation, which will be determined in accordance with EU law if a framework directive makes it to the light of day. The courts will decide whether the law has been breached and, of course, on the basis of the evidence presented to them, determine the cost of remediation. That is perfectly sensible. The EU White Paper does not propose a fine. It is a matter for consideration whether the polluter pays principle means that the polluter simply pays for restoration to the previous state, but not an additional cost, which could act as a deterrent. That is not covered in the White Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a nightmare, which is substantiated by climatic researchers, that the glories of the Norfolk broads and the fens, with their bird and animal life, will disappear as the cruel North sea moves into the county of Norfolk. In that case, who would be responsible for the effects of global warming and the widely predicted consequent loss of life? God, or somebody else?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking about environmental defences. Force majeure, or God, is clearly relevant here. The effects of global warming and the impact of the rising seas would not fall within the purlieu of the regime, which covers parties who have knowingly committed environmental damage. Human activity on a global scale, which has global consequences, is not a matter for the regime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: During the debate last week on GM foods on the Floor of the House, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was put in a difficult
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0726">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
position because a cross-reference was made about the legal positions of the Minister of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on the one hand in respect of environmental liability, and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the other. Furthermore, the Minister stated that there had been a considerable delay in the delivery of legal advice. Will he assure us that the delay did not relate to the problem with GM foods as respects the White Paper and the movement towards the directive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly assure the hon. Gentleman that there was no question that the delay, to use his words, or, to put it in more neutral terms, the time that it took to make a public statement, had anything to do with environmental liability. That regime does not exist other than as a tort of negligence, which is fault-based under English common law, or a tort of nuisance or a breach of statutory duty, which is a strict liability. Those liabilities are in place, and the famous Rylands <i>v.</i> Fletcher case comes to mind, although it may seem obscure.<br><br>
It is surprising, in the light of the Advanta case, that no civil liability cases have been brought under those English common law provisions. Had Advanta not decided to give what we believe to be fair and equitable compensation to the farmers affected, those common law provisions might have been exercised for the first time. On 3 April, Advanta discovered evidence from a German laboratory that contamination was possible, but it did not approach officials in my Department or in MAFF until 17 April, which is a significant time. It did not know then exactly which GM line was involved, although we now know that it was Hyola RT73. It seems a long time, but much hard evidence had to be collected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings us to the end of the time allotted for questions.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of the European Union Document No. 6230/00, a Commission White Paper on Environmental Liability; and supports the Government's welcome for the publication of the White Paper, its endorsement of the general principle of environmental liability, and its intention to scrutinise the proposals in order to establish implications for existing arrangements and assessment of the full Regulatory Impact Assessment on UK businesses.—[<i>Mr. Meacher.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>11.31 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Loughton <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Worthing and Shoreham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I thought, questions flew thick and furious; many were not answered—almost as many as were left unanswered by the White Paper. I shall quickly list our concerns. The Opposition are happy to take note of the White Paper, but we cannot possibly welcome the publication of a document that the Minister admits is rather closer to a Green Paper—and a very green one at that. A great amount of work remains to be done, and the House needs to be given more details before a decision can be taken. Of course, we agree with the general principle that the polluter should pay, but the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
polluter should have to pay in way that is clear and fair—one that benefits the environment, the Community and nation states at large.<br><br>
I echo the seven questions about the White Paper that were raised in the report of the European Scrutiny Committee. The Committee was not merely making observations, but asking fundamental questions about the White Paper's viability. The Committee mentioned the problems of placing an undue burden on enterprises; of it not being made clear in the White Paper whether the defence of compliance is admissible; and of alterating the burden of proof, which, as my hon. Friends have said, has severe implications for English law.<br><br>
How on earth one can value natural resources? That is the approach required under the White Paper. How would that fit in with existing tort law on negligent damage, the treatment of public interest groups and questions regarding the Lugano convention? The Minister has twice listed the many items of United Kingdom environmental legislation that make us one of the more highly regulated EU member states for environmental purposes. We welcome most, if not all, of that legislation, which was passed by the previous Government. Those national liability rules cover the traditional damage element of the White Paper—damage to individuals' health or to property—without unfairly distorting competition among United Kingdom companies. The terminology used in the White Paper would add undesirable complexity to the environmental legislation affecting United Kingdom companies. Any liability regime should, in principle, be fault based; that allows appropriate defences for the accused, such as a test of foreseeability.<br><br>
More worrying are the question marks remaining in respect of damage to biodiversity and who is responsible for the unowned environment. The White Paper is full of uncertainty about which sites would be covered, what would constitute damage to biodiversity, and how clean-up and restoration costs would be calculated and covered. Of course, uncertainty also exists about the Natura 2000 network. The list has not yet been drawn up, so we have proposals regarding sites that are yet to be identified. Will the Minister give us the state of play on drawing up the list of UK sites to be covered by Natura 2000?<br><br>
The CBI has pointed out that companies strongly object to the prospect of being held liable for damage that is difficult to define and not quantifiable, and therefore not insurable. That has serious consequences for the competitiveness of European companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) has mentioned.<br><br>
The Minister, understandably, was unable to answer all my queries about the habitats directive. He said that he did not expect that which would flow from the White Paper to override it and he expected the two to be compatible, but it is difficult to see how that can be. The habitats directive allows the carrying-out of plans or projects that adversely affect the integrity of the protected site
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0727">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<br><blockquote><p>for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature,</p></blockquote>
on condition that
<br><blockquote><p>the Member State shall take all compensatory measures necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of Natura 2000 is protected.</p></blockquote>
As for protection of species, derogation for social and economic public interest reasons is provided by article 16. On my reading, the White Paper makes no allowance for overriding public interest.<br><br>
I am also concerned about the stifling of enterprise, especially small to medium-sized enterprises, and the implications for competitiveness. It is unreasonable for the legislator to assign the entire risk of unnamed future damage to one party whose activity might benefit society as a whole. Failure to permit development risk as a defence is likely to stifle innovative developments by industry. The impact on investment, jobs, innovation and the structuring of companies could be considerable. Regulation in which business has confidence rests on sound science, a proper assessment of the risks of environmental impairment and a careful weighing up of the benefits of a measure against the costs of compliance and enforcement. We cannot see how that has been allowed for in the White Paper, which would impose disproportionate costs on small and medium-sized enterprises. Does the Minister envisage being able to obtain any concessions from the Chancellor? His boss, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, is notoriously bad at getting anything from the Chancellor for environmental measures. Would tax breaks, for example, be possible for training to help small and medium-sized enterprises not to fall foul of such environmental obligations?<br><br>
I am not a lawyer like some other hon. Members who are present and who have far greater expertise. However, it strikes me that the implications of the White Paper in respect of a diminishing burden of proof run completely contrary to the traditions of English law: it smacks of someone being presumed guilty until proven innocent, which is contrary to our legal system. It is a basic principle of United Kingdom law that the plaintiff should bear the burden of proving that the defendant caused the damage. The Commission's proposals to alleviate—I think that that is the term that it uses—that burden are vague: there is a difference between alleviation and reversal. Will the Minister clarify the extent to which requirements relating to the burden of proof are likely to be changed?<br><br>
I have already spoken about penalties and I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification, saying that they would be purely remedial—although I still wonder whether the courts have any powers to force companies that have caused environmental damage to desist from future action that might lead to the same sort of damage. Is the requirement for remedial action a cash requirement based on the cost of undertaking the work that has been deemed necessary? If the charge is not a fine, it is an unlimited penalty. The Minister said that he thought that the White Paper should entertain the possibility of a fine rather than a remedial penalty. Has he reflected on the fact that such an approach has the potential to make cases a criminal
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
matter under the European convention on human rights? In that respect, it could have profound implications for equality of arms and for the concept of a safe harbour. It is unreasonable for a company to be taken to the cleaners by an unlimited penalty for environmental damage, when it thought that it had complied in perfectly good faith with all the rules that it was required to obey in order to avoid causing such damage.<br><br>
The White Paper's references to the liability of the regulatory authorities are highly confusing. On the one hand, it provides that a defence of complying with an authorisation should not be allowed, so there is no safe harbour; on the other hand, it suggests that regulators might be made liable to contribute if the damage is entirely and exclusively caused by explicitly permitted emissions. That approach means that regulators might impose unreasonably tight requirements in order to minimise their risk. As the Minister said, companies that carry out activities that comply with all the regulations in force at the time might fall foul of subsequent changes in the law. I served on the Committee that debated the Financial Service and Markets Bill, which discussed this issue during wider debate on market abuse. The Opposition argued strongly that the compliance of an activity with specific authorisations by regulatory authorities should offer a defence to a company. That does not appear to be a basic tenet of the White Paper.<br><br>
Questions about continuing liability arise from that point. I appreciate that there is a limit on retroactive penalties, but who exercises control—I think that that is the proper term—over an activity and will, therefore, be liable for any penalties? Will the limit cover trustees in bankruptcy of a firm that has gone bust, or bank-appointed administrators? What about multiple contractors who have built an industrial site that later causes pollution because of faulty design or construction operations problems? Such projects can involve a combination of different contractors, builders, engineers and electricians, so who will be responsible? Who will have exercised the control that led to the polluting activity? We need a proper and clear basis for the allocation of responsibility, but the White Paper does not provide one. We also need a clearer definition of what constitutes new and old pollution. For example, if a landfill site starts to leak because of problems with its design some 20 years ago, is that retroactive pollution? Who would be responsible and who would exercise control, especially if the landfill site had long since ceased to operate?<br><br>
Pressure groups are a fairly new concept in English law. Allowing applications for judicial review to be made by environmental or other groups might lead to companies being harassed by vexatious complaints. Article 6 of the European convention on human rights provides that there should be equality of arms, and the Minister said that there are undertakings on the cross-payment of damages when complaints fail, but the White Paper does not explain how a business will be compensated if it is found not to be liable after direct action has been taken against it by, for example, a non-governmental organisation, and it has suffered
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0728">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
financially during a period of closure because of an injunction that halted its operation. That has serious implications for small and medium-sized enterprises, the future viability of which might be entirely at the mercy of vexatious action by NGOs. Even if an action is found to be false, the company involved might have gone bust in the interim.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Wearing my legal hat, I have had some experience of that problem. If the courts issue a certificate of public interest to determine whether an action is vexatious or frivolous—in many cases, it is neither—and the NGOs or whatever have not got the resources to support the public interest, too much emphasis is put on the assumption that the public authority or the Government are necessarily right. Therefore, it is important to have a public interest certificate that enables and supports public interest groups in their attempts to protect the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I defer to my hon. Friend's greater knowledge of the law. However, I am most worried about a vexatious complaint, started by an extremist group, which is not in the public interest. That is especially relevant to genetically modified organisms, which are a controversial subject. Governments are legitimately—it depends on one's point of view—going about their business, but the so-called public interest groups that are dedicated to destroying anything to do with GMOs can make highly vexatious and mischievous complaints. One GMO firm went bust as a result of such action. A compensatory measure must be available, not only because of the costs incurred in fighting what might be an expensive case that goes to Europe, but because of the costs that a company incurs when it has been prevented from carrying out its legitimate business. I express no opinion on the legitimacy of GMO-related operations, but that issue raises many questions that are yet to be answered.<br><br>
Finally, on the key issue of insurability, I was glad to hear the Minister say that he had consulted the Association of British Insurers. What was its advice? Insurability is an absolute prerequisite for any form of liability, but if the probabilities and extent of liability cannot be determined, a firm—especially a small firm—is unlikely to get insurance cover, which would make its activities untenable. The White Paper makes no provision for financial security. No insurance company would underwrite an open-ended liability that involves the biodiversity of the planet, on which a value cannot be placed. How does one cost the death of 10,000 fish in a river pollution incident? One could cost the remedial action needed to take the oil or chemicals from the river, but how on earth could one calculate for insurance purposes the accompanying biodiversity penalty? Practicality is the problem.<br><br>
I urge the Committee not to support the motion. The proposal has been published far too early and is far too unfinished. The White Paper might be described as a Spanish hotel measure—unfinished and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
needing much more work. Many questions must be answered. I have been to many Spanish hotels, of mixed quality, but the best are very good.<br><br>
We agree with the principle that the polluter should pay, but we need clear demarcation if penalties are to levied against polluters. We must settle the questions of who is responsible, what standards have been transgressed and where the liability ends. We also need a safe harbour for firms that expend money and other resources and go out of their way to comply with regulations.<br><br>
The White Paper has serious implications for subsidiarity and proportionality. We already have substantial liability regimes for environmental mispractice in member states, especially in the UK. In their current unfinished form, the White Paper's measures are highly anti-competitive. They would give the green light to vexatious pressure groups disrupting the legitimate activities of many companies. Great uncertainty would be brought to many businesses. Enterprise could be stifled and many, if not all, firms would be given a potentially open-ended financial liability.<br><br>
The White Paper fails to meet the tests of subsidiarity and proportionality. It does not make the case for action at EU level, or for the value of the environmental legislation that would affect this country. The paper seems to be heading towards potentially draconian terms.</span></p>
<p>11.50 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brake</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had a wide-ranging debate in the question-and-answer session, which could have gone on for much longer, if only time had allowed. We support the principles of environmental liability and polluter pays. However, much more must be done on a couple of areas in the White Paper from an environmental perspective, and I shall focus on those. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) will make a few points on the White Paper's legal and business implications later.<br><br>
The marine environment has been mentioned. The absence of that subject from the White Paper and national legislation must be addressed. I do not know whether it can be addressed through the White Paper, but the Government must focus on it. The other environmental area that has been highlighted is the question of damage and significant damage to biodiversity. Were the Minister likely to support changes in the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill so that it referred to damage as opposed to significant damage, it would be appropriate for the White Paper to refer to damage. The question of disturbance to biodiversity, as opposed to damage, is also not addressed. There are many concerns from a drafting perspective about the definitions used. Much tighter definitions are needed, not only in the environmental proposals but in those relating to business liability, insurance and other matters.<br><br>

The Minister has said that the White Paper raises more questions than it answers. We agree, which is why we do not consider the White Paper in its present form to be fit for the intended purpose.</span></p>
<p>11.53 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already alluded to the reasons why the European Scrutiny Committee decided that the White Paper should be considered on the Floor of the House, and our debate has reinforced my view. As the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) has just said, and as my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) also suggested, the more one considers the issue the more questions arise, not to create hassle or as a result of anti-Europeanism— that is just rubbish— but because some intrinsic and important questions need to be addressed. The Secretary of State and his advisers prepared a whole list of questions that occurred to them, which merely demonstrates the fact that they are deeply worried about the issue. Had the Secretary of State made protestations to the effect that everything in the White Paper was fine, that would have seemed thin, but he did not. In fact, he suggested that the White Paper raises some serious questions.<br><br>
The problem is that the European Commission issued the document as a White Paper and adopted it on 9 February 2000. That creates a situation. It is not a hope or a wing and a prayer; it is actually the policy adopted by the European Commission. How will the White Paper be implemented? We do not have control over the European Commission— frankly, no one does— and it has published the White Paper. Admittedly, the Council of Ministers can get to grips with it when the draft directive is implemented, but a serious issue arises time and again in relation to all such matters. As I said earlier in my question to the Minister, we will then be confronted with qualified majority voting. From reading the papers, it is obvious that the White Paper raises different legal considerations, not because we do not want to deal with trans-border environmental pollution—frankly, I do.<br><br>
Perhaps I should declare an extremely ancient interest. In the 1960s and 1970s, when I was embarking on my legal career, I was in private practice, and I advised the CBI on a whole range of matters relating to pollution control legislation, toxic solid wastes and pollution of rivers. I continued in practice for the best part of 20 years, so I am not exactly unfamiliar with the problems that arise in that area, with Rylands <i>v.</i> Fletcher and the whole question of strict liability. It is a nightmare of law. Having read some of the papers, I pay tribute to the way in which some very skilled lawyers in the Department are attempting to pick out the problems to try to stem the tide of consequences of adopting the White Paper.<br><br>
There are times when I would like people to regard me as pro-European because many of the issues on which somewhat artificial differences of opinion are created, for the sake of sensationalism or to demonstrate so-called party splits, turn out on closer investigation to demonstrate that I have more in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
common with people who favour a stable regime in Europe and in the United Kingdom than might be thought to be the case. When one gets down to the nuts and bolts and starts asking questions, one realises that the purpose of this entire exercise is to create a pan-European environmental liability regime. That is what the White Paper says, but if it is to happen, it will be necessary completely to overturn precedent for cases in the House of Lords— I am not being nostalgic; I am talking about the practical development of law— and the whole basis on which people think, behave and act, in terms of the burden of proof and the manner in which our law of negligence operates. Are we simply to turn around? Environmental liability is one example of our being tested.<br><br>
I put the question to the Minister of State, who is one of the more reasonable Ministers. He does not make cheap points, and never has done. I believe that he is aware of the issue that I am raising although he was cautious this morning. Adopting the White Paper will raise some important questions because it will mean overturning an array of British law. It is not a matter of being a little Englander, or whatever. What is the best way to proceed when dealing with environmental pollution? What are the proper tests? What is the correct use of negligence, tort and so on?<br><br>
I am bound to put the question: is it not now obvious? Why do we not start setting out the case, because nothing will change the basic framework of the document? We already know the result. We will almost certainly be outgunned because of qualified majority voting. A principle lies at the heart of this issue. Are we prepared to accept it in the first place? We ought to know. I do not want to accuse the Minister unfairly of being reticent, but there is a case for making it clear that we cannot follow this route.<br><br>
The Minister's own questions are extremely good. The consultation process may result in many more questions. It will involve 140 organisations, including the CBI, in the upper tier—although I do not care to use that term—with those representing multinationals and organisations of a similar type at one end of the spectrum and the Federation of Small Businesses at the other. There are massive questions involving international pollution, because companies have the same policies across the world. They could not operate if they did not.<br><br>
Environmental pollution affects everybody. It affects the air we breathe and the food we eat. As the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) said earlier, questions of liability could arise in the most extraordinary circumstances. Environmental pollution is an all-pervasive issue. We should recognise that we cannot accept the intrinsic proposals. We are not being curmudgeonly. It is impossible for us to accept them without bending our entire legal regime. The two things will not gel.<br><br>
A number of points in relation to the matters raised by the Department clearly illustrate the difficulties resulting from the White Paper. I have already mentioned my concern about GM foods. I heard what the Minister said, but there is a GM foods aspect to the issue. The polluter-pays principle could lead to rather
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0730">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
aggravated arguments down the line as to who is ultimately responsible. It is possible that the Government will become involved because it is not known—just as it was unknown with BSE—who will ultimately be responsible for giving consent. In a chain of legal actions, people inevitably try to pass liability down the line. A position of last resort may have to be taken. It may be covered by insurance, but Governments are not covered by insurance.<br><br>
Some big questions arise concerning GM foods, and are certainly matters of concern in relation to environmental liability. Regardless of whether the White Paper is directly relevant, I suspect that the issue will turn on the principles of Rylands <i>v.</i> Fletcher and so on. I was therefore rather impressed with the Minister of State's grasp of the legal implications. It never ceases to amaze me, when listening to hon. Members, that many have little in the way of legal training; but, my godfathers, when they become Ministers or Secretaries of State, it is astonishing how much knowledge they can acquire—and how relevant it is. I pay a small tribute to the Secretary of State—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is he Minister of State?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue calling the right hon. Gentleman Secretary of State. In any event, those important questions were tackled sensibly in the departmental response.<br><br>
A response was necessary because the European Scrutiny Committee said that the matter had to be debated as a matter of political and legal importance. It recommended that it should be debated in European Standing Committee B, but the Minister's response to the document gave rise to a range of other issues and questions. The members of European Standing Committee A—I beg the Committee's pardon; I gave it the wrong name a moment ago, but whether it is A or B is probably important only to the Chairman. Not unnaturally, the issue is whether or not we get to grips with the question in whichever form.<br><br>
It is precisely because we received that useful response that the responsible members of the Committee, who happened to be members of the Conservative party—the Committee can make of that what it likes—[HON. MEMBERS: "Conservative with a small 'c'".] We happened to be in a majority on that day. Would it not be wonderful if the Conservative members of the Committee turned up for a crucial, three-line Whip debate—for example, on the intergovernmental conference in Nice—only to find that Labour and Liberal Democrat Members had gone for the day to a Butlins holiday camp? We would win the vote. That is how our procedures function.<br><br>
We had the opportunity to use some common sense, which is exactly what we did. It was consistent with the Department's questions. There was nothing irresponsible in what we did. Indeed, it was necessary.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
I shall briefly glance at some of those questions. For example, we have already discussed what the Department calls the undue burden placed on enterprise, which has been conceded as being a matter of considerable importance. The question of whether there should be a defence of compliance with relevant Community or national legislation has not been tackled—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The shadow Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, says that it has been mentioned, but I add that the departmental response stated:
<br><blockquote><p>An express defence of compliance with any relevant legislation would be unusual.</p></blockquote>
The Department then asked:
<br><blockquote><p>Is it justifiable to place enterprises already faced by a strict liability regime, under a duty to disprove an alleged causal link between their activities and any damage to the environment?</p></blockquote>
That is the burden of proof point that I have already dealt with. It then said:
<br><blockquote><p>It is clear that any such suggestion—</p></blockquote>
that is alleviating the burden of proof—
<br><blockquote><p>could not be left to be settled at a later stage.</p></blockquote>
It therefore must be dealt with immediately. That raises the question of the change of law and what I have already said about the necessity for a yes or no answer to the question of principle that lies at the heart of the White Paper.<br><br>
The question of the valuation of natural resources is a recognised difficulty. Then the question arises of relating the White Paper's approach to tort law on negligent damage to individuals or property. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham mentioned public interest groups, for which I have some affection born out of many battles. While advising business, I have on several occasions made suggestions that I thought might be helpful, because I knew that the only chance to get the public interest right at a public inquiry was for the inspector to have the opportunity to listen to both sides of the case. A public interest certificate seemed to me in those days to provide an opportunity to take part in an inquiry with the proper equipment from Mitre Court buildings or Harcourt buildings—the best barristers available. Lastly, the reason for not signing the Lugano convention needs to be considered.<br><br>
Huge questions need to be answered. We should be rational and clear. I am not a member of Standing Committee A, but none the less I am interested in the matter and am a member of the Select Committee. If I may offer advice, it is that the White Paper should be rejected. There are grounds for doing so now. The serious question of dealing with European legislation in a manner consistent with proper scrutiny should then be tackled.</span></p>
<p>12.10 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chaytor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly about the issues that have been raised and, to begin with, about matters of process. I do not want to reopen the matter of whether the debate should have been held on the Floor of the House, but the hon. Member for Stone raised an important point. The White Paper is a document of overwhelming importance and needs the widest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0731">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
possible circulation and opportunity for debate. Will there be a further opportunity to discuss the Government's formal response when it is ready? The argument for a debate on the Floor of the House now is weaker than an argument for such a debate after the Government have formulated their response, which is when real decisions will be made and it will be possible to tackle the meat of the issue, rather than dealing with it in the tentative way we have been doing this morning.<br><br>
My understanding is that recommendations of the Scrutiny Committee included a reference to the Environmental Audit Committee and a request for its opinion on the White Paper. I understand that that is a comparatively new power, which has not been used before. I am a member of the Environmental Audit Committee. Yesterday we considered our response to the request, but I do not see a copy of it in the papers this morning. Even if it were available it would be useless as no hon. Member would have had time to read it. [<i>Interruption.</i>] It is there. I apologise. My point is that when documents are requested from other Committees it is crucial to operate on a timetable permitting hon. Members adequate sight of the documents before the debate.<br><br>
The White Paper is enormously important. I was pleased that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham welcomed the principle of environmental liability, but he seemed to go on to undermine his welcome of that principle. Excepting the fact that he drew attention to many of the ill-defined and unanswered questions asked by the White Paper and to many complicated legal issues that have not yet been resolved, I felt that he none the less undermined any support whatever for the principle of environmental liability. It is very disappointing that the Opposition intend to oppose the White Paper. Although I have referred to some of its shortcomings, it is fairly tentative and green. It would be unfortunate to oppose it, because the best way of obtaining clarification of the many issues that remain open is for the document to be published and circulated. It is completely self-defeating to oppose the White Paper if one is serious about pursuing the debate on environmental liability and clarifying the questions about which many of us remain concerned.<br><br>
The White Paper introduces the concept of environmental liability and makes it clear that that will become a reality in due course. Of course, it is an idea whose time has come and it cannot be resisted. There is overwhelming and increasing public support for the concept, regardless of the difficulties of establishing the details. Sooner or later, there will be a European environmental liability regime. However, the White Paper is important not only for that reason. It sends an important signal to business and to the wider community, in whose economic processes natural resources have traditionally been seen as capable of exploitation for short-term gain, that natural resources are not infinite and need to be sustained for the long-term benefit of all of our futures and that traditional economic processes must now be restrained to a greater or lesser degree. We cannot continue to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
organise our economy as we have done, especially during the past 200 years, by unthinkingly accepting the plundering of scarce and precious natural resources, be they air, water, earth, species or rare habitats.<br><br>
As we move into the new millennium, the most successful, innovative and profitable economic processes are likely to be those which involve an understanding of the importance of sustainable development and of protecting natural resources to ensure that the planet does not gradually decline into an arid desert. Many companies are beginning to appreciate that need and to see that there are huge markets to be developed in what might loosely be called the new, renewable technologies, which can serve our natural resources and yet generate significant gain for the population as a whole.<br><br>
I support the resolution that is before us and the continuing debate on the White Paper, with a view to clarifying all the open questions that it raises, not because I want a ruthless authoritarian regime that clamps down on companies and puts them out of business when they make errors and destroy scarce habitats or species, but because I recognise the White Paper's value as a deterrent. As the document and one or two of the papers that comment on it mention, it will concentrate the minds of the whole population and of specific businesses on the consequences of their actions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Environmental Audit Committee touched on that matter in paragraph 6 of its response, where it said that it saw the White Paper as providing an "end-of-pipe solution". Will the hon. Gentleman expand on his Committee's thinking? Did it think that there should be more preventive measures rather than deterrent measures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chaytor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would love to expand on my Committee's two minutes' thinking about the matter yesterday morning, which brings me back to my reservations about our procedure. We met yesterday, when the paper was presented to us, but had little time to consider it because our agenda was fixed for an evidence session.<br><br>
I take the point made by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine completely: it is an end-of-pipe solution, the last resort. The value of firmly establishing within the Europewide legal framework the concept of environmental liability is that it will act as a deterrent. No one wants companies to be prosecuted, because the object is to prevent damage from occurring in the first place. Equally, no one is so naive as to assume that once an environmental liability regime is enforced there will be no damage. There have been some appalling examples of pollution in the past year or two: in the Danube; in southern Spain, which had disastrous effects on bird life; and off the west coast of France, where spillage from an oil tanker destroyed the biodiversity of huge swathes of Brittany.<br><br>
In two weeks' time, the Ospar conference, named for Oslo and Paris, will meet to consider the specific issue of radioactive pollution in the North sea. There are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0732">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
many examples of pollution, some of it marine, that are not included in the new regime. In recent years, rare species and habitats that have developed over many years—remarkable examples of almost unique biodiversity, especially surrounding the Danube—have been destroyed. We will stop such things only by ensuring that a firm regime of environmental liability is in place.<br><br>
I regret that the Opposition oppose the measure. If they are serious about supporting the principle, the best way of doing so is by contributing a continuing, wide-ranging debate on the White Paper. No one argues that it will be easy; no one says that all the questions have been, or can be, answered. There may be a continuing debate about the precise means of evaluating natural resources, about the various legal issues of tort, negligence, the defence of compliance and the diminishing burden of proof. Those issues must be clarified, but no law would ever be passed if we required absolute assurance that everything had been resolved before it was enacted. We must accept some imperfection in the light of the overwhelming importance of putting in place the principle of environmental liability. I hope that the Committee will support the proposal.</span></p>
<p>12.21 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would help if the Minister for the Environment would explain how Members of the House could influence the process of legislation because, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is extremely vague and uncertain at present. The problem with our procedure is that there is no clear point at which the House can influence the final stages of the Government's stance. In the end, it will be how the Government behave and how they cope with negotiating with other members on qualified majority voting that will decide what European directive will apply to the United Kingdom. The Government's stance will be crucial. The House should have a direct influence on how the Minister proceeds in the light of that stance at a later stage in the process, but that may not be possible.<br><br>
It may be the arcane language, but it seems premature for the Government to welcome the White Paper when they are still considering the consultations and when they are worried about the vagueness and uncertainty of much that is in that document. We may need longer to consider statements, and to raise some key matters, such as the issue of third parties becoming involved.<br><br>
The Minister for the Environment did not have a chance to say whether those third parties can operate across national boundaries, or whether, for third party ability to initiate legislation, the parties have to be based in the nation in which the pollution occurred. There is a lot of concern in this country about the fact that we are tougher and harder on ourselves in a lot of legislation than some of our competitors. It might be perversely helpful if third parties could work across boundaries.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
The Minister also talked about the cross-undertaking as an attempt to deter vexatious litigation, but is the ability of those involved to meet any liability considered before they initiate legal action? Ill-defined third parties could come into existence and then disappear. Having limited their liability as one organisation, they could re-form their memberships in other third parties and reappear to carry out further legal action. There should be some expansion of how that would work.<br><br>
Concerning whether it would be beneficial to act at a European or UK level, the key fact is that pollution can be transnational. As some hon. Members have pointed out, that requires the EU to work beyond its boundaries when negotiating. It is important to consider making best use of a framework for making common regulations that can be mutually beneficial.<br><br>
When it comes to effectiveness, our businesses have to compete in two directions. They have to compete internally within the European Union, given that 50 per cent. of our trade is there, so it would be helpful if the Government provided us, either now or later, with an assessment of the competing regimes that currently apply in other EU nations. It would give us an idea of whether such regulation will impose more burdens on UK business or on our competitors in the rest of the European Union. We want to ensure that having a more effective environmental regime in this country than in others does not mean that our business are unfairly disadvantaged in internal competition in the EU. Our pig farmers are a classic example of imposing increased regulations on an economic sector in this country without making them EU-wide at the start. Those farmers have been exposed to open competition with no protection.<br><br>
The EU as a whole could happily feel that it is internally competitive, and then find that it is gently going down the pan when it comes to surviving in the world economy. It is important that the Government encourage our partners in the EU to consider their actions in the context of the wider world. In the long run, the thriving of the European economy requires a recognition of where costs and burdens fall.<br><br>
We have to recognise that there are long-term pollution costs to society and individuals, and our regime must ensure that the right people meet those costs. The Government have to tackle the detailed concerns being made in representations; it seems back to front that we cannot time our deliberations to occur when the Government have assessed them. In response to the hon. Member for Bury, North, the Minister may highlight more firmly when, if or how he will ensure that we can see his ideas when they can still be influenced, and before it is too late in terms of influencing the rest of the European Union.</span></p>
<p>12.27 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Sayeed, as I serve on the European Scrutiny Committee as well as on this Committee. I want to repeat what my hon. Friend the Member for Stone said, that we had a properly constituted Select Committee last week, and we asked
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0733">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
for the debate to be held on the Floor of the House, where more hon. Members could attend. A debate at 10.30 in European Standing Committee A, which I have attended on many occasions, always has a thin response. Although anyone can come here, many hon. Members are tied up in Select Committees. I should have been at the Agriculture Committee this morning. This debate is not an adequate substitute.<br><br>
That is especially sad, because the Minister's response made interesting reading. It showed that the Government are not happy, and that, at best, the document is inchoate, has not been properly thought through, and raises many questions.<br><br>
I do not say that for party political reasons; it is simply an unsatisfactory document. It is an ideal subject to be dealt with on the Floor of the House when more hon. Members can attend, as the hon. Member for Bury, North suggested. The best time to discuss the matter is not 10.30 on a busy morning. It is sad that the Leader of the House ignored the majority decision of the Select Committee and insisted that the matter be dealt with this morning, when only 10 Members are here to participate. I endorse the Environmental Audit Committee's conclusion that
<br><blockquote><p>If and when the Commission proceeds to firm legislative proposals we would welcome a full debate on the floor of the House.</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will take up that sensible suggestion. When this woolly, open-ended document is firmed up with concrete proposals, we should have a real opportunity to debate it and enable many more hon. Members to attend. As the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby said, if the document is not properly scrutinised and improved, it could have devastating consequences.<br><br>
I shall explain my argument briefly, as I want the Minister to reply, and my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has raised many of the points that I wanted to make. The document is basically saying, "We don't know what the liability will be in relation to your business, but you will have to pay for it. We do not know whether there is a limit, what the time scale is or who will raise the issue, and we cannot give you recourse to an appeal mechanism. You'll just have to stump up."<br><br>
I object to the little-Europe approach, which is present in many of the documents that are discussed in this Committee. It implies that the outside world can be shut out, and that we can limit consideration of such questions to the geographical area covered by the 15 nations of the European Union. The world does not work like that. The Danube, for instance, flows in and out of EU and non-EU countries, some of which will not become part of the EU for a long time. Joska Fischer said a couple of weeks ago that Romania would not come into the EU until 2020.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chaytor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman's comment on the wider international perspective. Will he accept that the logic of his remarks is in favour of a global environmental liability regime?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in many ways I would be more sympathetic to United Nations involvement, so that all nations could be involved. I do not see why the EU has special competence in this area. That was the subject of my first question to the Minister—I asked for three examples of how the EU is especially competent in the environmental sphere, but could not obtain an answer. In fact, the EU is one of the greatest polluting agencies. One of the greatest pollutants in the North sea is the common fisheries policy because more dead fish are put back into the sea than are landed live for human consumption.<br><br>
The raft of existing UK legislation, which is listed in annex B, shows that damage from breaches of integration pollution control and waste management can be addressed. There is not enough time to list that legislation now. However, I cannot see how imposing another tier of legislation at European level will improve matters in this country. It will drive businesses out of Europe, and especially Britain, because, inevitably, as the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine said, we will impose the rules much more strictly than other European nations. Anyone running a risky or innovative business will not be tempted to stay here for long if there is a danger that the precautionary principle will be imposed by a fanatical interest group. There will be an incentive to go abroad, outside the EU. That is the reason for my earlier comments about the little-Europe approach. Businesses no longer have a special reason to stay here. If the regime is made too difficult or expensive, they will leave. Signs of appalling equity are appearing.<br><br>
The way to have a successful and clean environment is to have successful business. Anyone who has seen the damage done by state planning in Albania or the Caucasus knows that it is capitalism that delivers a clean environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chaytor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must respond to that point, given that I am probably one of the few Members of Parliament who has spent some time in Albania, both under the previous Stalinist regime and during the current mad rush for privatisation. The difficulties in that country are caused by 10 years of obsession with the transfer to a completely deregulated free market. We cannot conclude that any one political system leads to a greater or lesser degree of pollution.<br><br>
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that companies have been relocating out of Europe for the past 15 or 20 years as part of the globalisation process, without there being an environmental liability regime in Europe? It is already happening for other reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are eating into time, so I shall be quick. I went to Albania shortly after the wall came down and saw the horrific consequences of state planning. I stood in a brook that was running black crude oil. To say that the difficulties in Albania have been caused by what has happened there during the past 10 years is a bad argument to use, when it has suffered 50 years of communism. Oil extraction has been carried out in the North sea under a capitalist

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
regime and money is being made, yet there has been dramatically less pollution than has occurred as a result of oil extraction in Albania.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although companies have performed effectively in the North sea, they have done so in a regulatory environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly my point. We have a satisfactory regulatory market. To save time, I have not read out all the various Acts of Parliament that were introduced by the previous Government to establish that situation. People have made money from the North sea; much oil has been extracted, yet there has not been any major environmental damage, whereas there has been catastrophic environmental damage in the old, centrally planned states in Asia and Albania.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine referred to the pig regime. If we introduce standards in this country or in Europe that render businesses uncompetitive, those businesses will either close or move out. That is what has happened with the pig industry and I fear that it will happen with chicken businesses because of the cages directive. Those real worries were brought to my attention in a memo from the NFU.<br><br>
Can the Minister guarantee that a serious study will be undertaken into the impact of the proposal on small businesses before it comes back to the House? That is the most useful action that the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions could take. Can a study be undertaken also into limiting liability? Under the White Paper, the liability could be grossly disproportionate. Has the Minister had discussions with the insurance industry? If not, will he outline the insurance industry's reaction to the White Paper and how it will take it on board?<br><br>
It is extraordinary that, acting within a permit will not count as a defence under the regime. An SME could be affected by the level of a river dropping if the climate had changed, although it could be well within its constraint limits on emissions into a river. Under the White Paper, the business could be closed and completely disproportionate measures could be brought against it.<br><br>
It is unacceptable that interest groups should be able to bring cases against businesses, especially if that occurred across international boundaries—a point to which my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham drew attention. It is relevant to organic and GM issues, because this country has a much tighter definition of organic than elsewhere. Today, one supermarket said that 47 per cent. of its organic products were purchased from abroad, but I doubt that the regimes which sell such products would qualify. The ability for outside interest groups to open up vexatious litigation could cause genuine problems for legitimate businesses that qualify under current UK qualifications.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
Both the NFU and the CBI sent hostile memos, which is not usual for either of them. There are real dangers in imposing an extra layer of authority on environmental matters that have not been thought out. Real damage could be done to legitimate businesses that function profitably and responsibly in a detailed UK regime. I shall therefore oppose the motion.</span></p>
<p>12.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a rather good, detailed and well argued debate, with not only differences of view but a good deal of agreement about the fact that the White Paper is inadequate—a view that I share, as I said. Our discussion has been less confrontational, more open and, perhaps, more seriously engaged in genuine debate than it might have been had it been taken on the Floor of the House. I hear what hon. Members on both sides have said about the importance of a debate involving all hon. Members on the Floor of the House and I shall certainly undertake strongly to relay their comments to my colleagues.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made the case that the White Paper fails the test of subsidiarity and proportionality. I agree that several matters have not been dealt with properly. He pointed out that the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which the previous Government introduced and which I greatly respect, involves fault-based litigation. That is not always so: UK statute and common law contains a mixture of fault-based and strict liability, especially in private law, but in some statutory regimes too. As I said, provision is made for strict liability in the case of contaminated land.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked about damage to biodiversity and how clean-up costs would be allocated. It is for the regulatory bodies, not the courts, to decide whether remediation is needed. If it is, and a case is brought, it is for the courts to determine the extent of the remediation required and to allocate costs.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked about Natura 2000 sites. I am well aware that within the Atlantic biogeographical area the number of sites and species that have been submitted under the habitats directive to the Commission has not been as large as it believes is justified. Fourteen of the 15 member states have been subject to pressure from the Commission and the threat of infraction proceedings. That includes us, although many other member states are involved. A conference was held in Kilkee in Northern Ireland a few months ago, at which the UK made it clear that we shall now comply with the new criteria. We genuinely did not believe that the implications of the directive went as far as the Commission now says.<br><br>
The CBI has made it clear that the extent of damage, the impact and, therefore, the liability must be quantifiable, precise and clear. I entirely agree. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked whether the habitats directive could be over-ridden. The liability regime would ensure that, when damage occurs on habitat sites, restoration can be required by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0735">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
regulatory bodies, people whose interests are affected or public interest groups. The liability regime would therefore be compatible with the principles that are applicable to habitat sites. He is right to say that this is a complex area, and I undertake to have a further look at this important issue.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also raised the key question of defence. He asked whether a company that is contemplating a major development would feel inhibited by the risk of liability, and whether enterprise and new investment would be stifled. Clearly, it is critical that that should not happen, and the White Paper certainly should not stifle enterprise, development and future investment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North said, it will act as a proper deterrent against reckless investment and activities that damage the environment. We are trying to strike a balance, and I believe that it is possible to do so, but I agree that, at the moment, the White Paper does not. Unless it is significantly improved, we would also find it difficult to support it.<br><br>
I have already commented on the burden of proof. There are matters that are so exclusively within the mind of the defence that English law takes the view that there should be some reduction in the burden of proof on the plaintiff. That is not an EU concept but a perfectly reasonable and traditional UK concept. As I have said, res ipsa loquitur: the matter speaks for itself. It is reasonable that the burden of proof be transferred to the defence, who must show that what was alleged is not the case.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham also asked about cash remediation. Cash remediation means that the environment must be restored to its previous state, and in many cases the work would be undertaken by the offending body or company. It is not necessarily a question of handing over cash to the courts, although I presume that cash remediation could be achieved through such an arrangement. There is a cash equivalent, but the basis is not one of cash payments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point, what would happen if an environmental feature were destroyed, and it could not be restored to its former state? What remediation would occur then?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. The proposal is that there should be an equivalent alternative resource if restoration to the pre-existing state is not feasible. As other hon. Members have said, there is no established way in which to put a cash value on natural resources. The Italian courts and the United States courts have tried, but no one has devised rules with sufficient certainty and predictability to prevent further recourse to litigation. It is probably impossible to devise such rules, and the issue remains a difficult one.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham also asked about the question of a fine, on which I have commented. As he says, we are talking about a criminal offence, which is a matter for the existing UK regimes. The Department accepts that the courts are imposing fines that are too low—that is certainly my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
view—and the matter is being considered and guidance for the courts formulated. However, I should make it clear that that issue is separate from the White Paper proposals.<br><br>
I turn briefly to the other points raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. He asked a question to which the White Paper currently provides no answer: who exercises control, or in other words, who is the liable party? For example, if a company or organisation has gone bankrupt, are the trustees liable? What about cases involving multiple contractors? Those are relevant questions, and we shall advance our views on them to the Commission working group.<br><br>
On the question of vexatious litigation, I said in my earlier response that, although this is not in the White Paper, the UK Government propose that there should be cross-undertaking in damages. In other words, the plaintiff would pay the costs of the defendant who was acquitted. That would be likely to deter unreasonably vexatious or frivolous litigation. It certainly should do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will not resolve the question. I do not want to repeat what I said earlier about public interest certificates, but the non-governmental organisations will simply be wiped out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be telepathic, because that was my next point. We should look seriously at the hon. Gentleman's idea of public interest certificates, because whether a matter is genuinely in the public interest is an important point. I agree that the GM issue has reached—I must choose my words with great care—a frenzied state. We need to examine carefully the difference between a genuine public interest issue and a totemistic fetish. These are genuine issues. I am well known in the Government as quite a sceptic on this issue, but some of the allegations border on the absurd.<br><br>
Insurability is an important objective for which we need clear, coherent, non-open-ended rules. Again, that is one of the matters that we shall be pressing. I should like to take up the point made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington about "significant". I was going to say that that was a significantly complex issue. It is certainly very difficult. It is addressed in the recent contaminated land regime that came into force in April. We have extensive guidance on what that means in relation to contaminated land, and we intend to work closely with the Commission on the issue. That does not exactly answer the hon. Gentleman's question, but if he would like to write to me I can certainly spell out in more detail what we have in mind. I respect the attendance here of the hon. Member for Stone. He is not a member of the European Scrutiny Committee, but he takes these matters extremely seriously and advances a range of important points on them. I thank him for that.<br><br>
The case for EC action is to implement the provisions of the treaty that relate to polluter pays and the precautionary principle, but I repeat that the key point is to determine in exactly what form that should be done, and how the interface with existing law finally works out. Several issues remain to be clarified in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0736">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
manner broadly acceptable to us. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine wrongly stated that we welcomed the White Paper. If he reads the terms of the motion, that is not what we say. We welcome the publication of the White Paper and state that there should be further intensive discussion about its details.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stone raised the question of GM involvement. Obviously, that is a classic area in which the application of environmental liability is unclear. It is possible that the tort of nuisance will be able to cope with it. However, as far as I know it has not been tried—I am not aware of any civil liability cases affecting GM—and we do not know. It would be sensible to examine what might be the best regime for dealing with the effects of cross-pollination on other farmers within close proximity. We have also read in the press about the impact on beekeepers. These are difficult issues, and we need a clear legal provision to deal with them.<br><br>
I have responded to the question of defence of compliance, which the hon. Gentleman raised. The fact that persons have licences and do not breach them does not automatically protect them from the consequences of their actions. That is not an EU idea; it is already the case under some UK regimes.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right that the alleviation of the burden of proof must be decided early on. It is not a matter that one can postpone, because it fundamentally alters the nature of the regime. We need clear answers now, or over the next few months, about exactly what is being proposed. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the Lugano convention. We share his party's view that the wording is not as clear and as sharp as it should be.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North made two procedural points, and I have said that I shall take them on board. There is a clear desire on both sides for the matter to be debated further and for Back-Bench Members to be able to influence the Government at a formative stage in their thinking, instead of our reaching a conclusion and presenting it as a fait accompli. If Parliament is to operate properly, Back-Bench Members should be able to have an impact while it still has time to register.<br><br>
My hon. Friend referred to the Environmental Audit Committee's response being ready in time. I shall leave that to my colleagues—the business managers and the Committee itself. He made a case for the general principle of environmental liability and for continuing debate, which I strongly endorse. He is right that that would concentrate the minds of companies and act as a deterrent.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine mentioned preventive influence. I see the proposals as being a preventive influence. The fact of not having taken appropriate action to secure one against liability at a later stage in one case is an effective driver for proper precautionary and preventive action. The hon. Gentleman has had a chance to read the motion, and we are not welcoming
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
the proposals at this stage. He asked about public interest groups operating across boundaries. I do not believe that the system operates quite like that. If a public interest group in the UK was advised by a French or German member, that would not be ruled out, but we would not hold our companies responsible to a public interest group in Paris or Bonn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just considering whether there was a reverse benefit. Where a competing company in another country was avoiding the costs of pollution, because there was less desire to implement its public interest there, could an aggrieved company in this country use its third-party status to argue that its economic viability was being undermined by lack of environmental control in the other country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting near the time limit. I am not entirely clear how the principle would work. I shall look into it further and write to the hon. Gentleman. He talked about evasion of liability through a change in the corporate identity. My understanding is that the courts have a great deal of experience in assessing that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I am wrong on that point, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will write to me. He talked about our companies being disadvantaged by a tougher environmental regime, and the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) raised a similar point. However, that seems to me to be an argument for raising standards across Europe so that the competitive challenge is levelled up. I accept that the hon. Member for North Shropshire was talking about companies moving outside the EU, but, as he rightly said, the White Paper is concerned not simply with EU legislation but with the effects of globalisation, which is a much wider issue. It cannot be an argument for diminishing proper and desirable environmental standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As it is the hon. Gentleman, I shall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Loughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make an offer, as the Minister is about to run out of time or sit down. As he shares many of our concerns, if he can guarantee to take up the suggestion of the hon. Member for Bury, North that there should be a full debate on the White Paper on the Floor of the House, with the Government's recommendations at that stage, so that all hon. Members can participate, I shall urge Opposition Members not to vote against the motion. Can he give us that guarantee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give that explicit guarantee, because the hon. Gentleman knows that I would have to have the business managers' agreement. I certainly believe that that would be desirable and I shall make a strong representation to my colleagues and to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that is as far as I can go.<br><br>
If I may conclude, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North said, I do not believe that it is right to reject the White Paper at this stage. It undermines the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0737">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
position of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that he favours the principle of environment liability, because it suggests that that is not altogether serious and that anything from the European Union should somehow be rejected out of hand.</span></p>
