Convergence of the Telecommunications, Media and Information Technology Sectors</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>[<i>Relevant document: European Community Document No. 12793/97, a Commission Communication on the information society and the protection of human dignity.</i>]</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Commission's Green Paper on convergence. Unfortunately, my hon. Friend the Minister for Arts, who together with me signed the explanatory memorandum, cannot be with us today—he and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport are hosting the United Kingdom presidency's European Union audiovisual conference in Birmingham.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Minister for Arts and I stated in our explanatory memorandum, the Green Paper aims to start a debate on issues raised by convergence. Chapter I of the Green Paper considers the scope of convergence; chapter II deals with its impact on telecommunications media and information technology sectors and its social and economic context. Chapter III examines existing and possible barriers to convergence, chapter IV deals with regulatory implications of convergence and chapter V considers principles and options for future regulation.<br><br>
The Green Paper poses a series of questions. My hon. Friend the Minister for Arts and I have provided the Committee with a draft outline of the Government's reponse. The Commission's paper covers some important issues that are also being considered in the United Kingdom—including of course, by the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport—so this debate is timely. The Commission's consultation period extends until the end of April; the Government are reflecting on our reply to the Commission on questions raised by the Green Paper and we will submit a response by the end of the month. As I mentioned, I have provided the Committee with the most up-to-date draft of our response—I emphasise that it is a draft—and we will ensure that Parliament receives a copy of the final version. The timing of this debate allows us to take the Committee's views into account when drafting the final version.<br><br>
In our response, we will also take into account the views of industry, users, consumers and other interest groups—we asked for their views by the end of March. Several broad themes emerged in the responses that we received: regulation should be consistent, transparent and fair; we must avoid dividing society into the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
information rich and the information poor; regulatory bodies should be based at national level, but there should be strong co-operation between regulators in different member states; and public service broadcasting is important.<br><br>
Understandably, views on future regulatory models differed. Several respondents commented that it is important to keep an open mind, as the converged environment is still developing. None the less, broad support emerged for an evolutionary approach that does not rush into a totally new framework but builds on existing structures.<br><br>
Views also differed on the question of whether regulation should be horizontal or vertical. In the former, content is regulated separately from the means of delivery; the latter applies different rules to content delivered by telephone and by broadcast media, for example. Several respondents thought that broadcasting—public service broadcasting in particular—should be a special case. Others were keen that sector-specific regulations should not stifle the growth of new information society services.<br><br>
During the coming weeks, we will be revising the draft outline in the light of the comments already received—and of course the comments of the Committee.<br><br>
Under the United Kingdom presidency, the Green Paper has been discussed at the Telecoms Council meeting that I chaired on 25 February and at an informal seminar for Ministers responsible for culture and audiovisual technology, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister for Arts hosted in Macclesfield from 15 to 17 March. Public consultation on the Green Paper continues until the end of April. The Commission then intends to produce a report on the outcome of that consultation by the summer break. It has said that it is likely to prepare what it calls a convergence action plan by the end of the year. On that basis, proposals for Community legislation, if there are any, will not be drawn up before next year.<br><br>
The Select Committee on European Legislation suggested that we include in this debate the Commission's communication on the response to the Green Paper on human dignity and the protection of minors in audiovisual and information services, including a proposal for a Council recommendation.<br><br>
For the new audiovisual services to reach their full potential, there must be a climate of confidence. That will be achieved only if public interests such as human dignity and the protection of minors can be secured. The draft Council recommendation will foster international co-operation and promote a self-regulatory framework, which should help develop that confidence. I hope that it will be adopted by the Council of Ministers at the Audiovisual and Culture Council on 28 May.<br><br>
As I have already said, major cultural issues are clearly linked to the convergence debate. Indeed, the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport considered those matters last week. However, I am obviously interested to hear the Committee's views, and I will happily pass those on to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0338">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Minister. The Committee has until 11.30 am at the latest to question the Minister. I ask hon. Members to keep their questions brief and to ask them one at a time. There is ample opportunity for all hon. Members to be called.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the explanatory memorandum, Ministers place a heavy and entirely welcome emphasis on subsidiarity. Does the Minister see any advantage in having a co-ordinated European Union approach, rather than allowing the bilateral evolution of UK and other national policies or taking a more global approach? What is the particular added value in the European dimension?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) raises some important points. On some issues, an EU approach is correct—a good example is telecommunications. Our presidency has coincided with the single market in telecoms, which came about on 1 January. Indeed, what the EU has achieved in that respect—a driving forward of the agenda—is widely appreciated because broadcasting and telecoms are important.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman rightly asked what was important at the national level. Matters such as the granting of licences are clearly for national jurisdiction, as is detailed enforcement. However, some European Union recommendations may be helpful, as, for instance, was the EU recommendation on harmful material on the internet.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked what global considerations were important. Copyright is a good example, as it is a matter to be considered world wide, not only by the UK or the EU. Another subject for global consideration is electronic commerce, and a conference in Ottawa in October is concentrating on that enormously important subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's opening statement, particularly the Government's emphasis on subsidiarity and on taking broadcasting separately. Where convergence is seen to be advantageous, will the Government seek to ensure that best practice is pursued rather than having to make unacceptable compromises; and, if best practice is UK practice, will the Government press the UK's case hard in discussions with other member states?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. The audiovisual and culture council noted that cultural diversity is strong and that people clearly want to enhance it. However, this is an odd area for politicians because technology is driving the debate forward at an enormous pace. We have yet to see how individuals, communities and countries respond to that. My hon. Friend's remarks about best practice are important. We shall endeavour to ensure that those remarks are kept on board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has very helpfully tabled the draft United Kingdom response to the Green Paper and, in her helpful introductory remarks, given us an indication of the flavour of responses. Given that the documents were prepared a week or two ago, can
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
she update us on any new responses or on any additional thoughts that she might have had? Can she say more about the definition of "information rich" and "information poor"? I sought to obtain from her colleague, the Minister for Science, Energy and Industry, similar definitions of fuel poverty, and it would be helpful to know what she has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first question, we are still in the response period and we are analysing the responses that have come in, which are in line with the draft recommendations. The recommendations are in outline, almost note, form, but I was anxious to give the Committee as much information as I could. Some of our first thoughts touch on my answer to the previous question in that convergence is more a technical than a market phenomenon. We must have a coherent response. We shall seek to develop the principles of coherency in economic regulation and of consistency in content regulation. I need not remind the Committee that this is a complex and evolving matter.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's second question deals with an important point about perhaps one of the greatest challenges for all of us. We are in the middle of an information revolution that will affect not only our economic life—electronic commerce will alter how we do business—but our social and cultural life. Indeed, it will affect everything that we do. Therefore, it is important that we develop existing initiatives so that everyone is included in the information society. We cannot truly have an information society until everyone is included.<br><br>
I shall do my best to give a definition, but this is a difficult matter. As the hon. Gentleman will know—he had the pleasure of being a schools Minister—it is important that everyone starts IT training at an early stage, and we are trying to ensure that that happens. It is also important that teachers keep themselves updated. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has proposed the national grid for learning, which involves not only school equipment, but the role of teachers and keeping them constantly updated.<br><br>
We have other proposals, such as the Department of Trade and Industry's "IT for all" initiative, which was started under the previous Administration. We have continued to support that initiative indeed, we have provided extra funding for it in the past financial year. Under that initiative, we seek to provide hands-on experience for people who are perhaps apprehensive about new technology or find it a little frightening. It is difficult to give the hon. Gentleman an exact definition, but I have mentioned some of the steps that the Government are taking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister has mentioned a couple of times the problem of harmful material on the internet and the draft Council recommendation on the protection of minors and human dignity in audiovisual and information services. Can she tell the Committee a little more about what is envisaged in that recommendation? In particular, is it intended to adopt at European level the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0339">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
self-regulatory approach to tackling this problem, which I think is widely recognised to have been effective in the United Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raised the important issue of harmful material on the internet and referred to the related document that has been tagged for this debate.<br><br>
We have a duty to tackle the problem of harmful material for two main reasons. First, such material needs a policy to deal with it. Secondly, although the amount of material is quite small in relation to the overall content of the internet, it gives those who are not familiar with the internet an impression that we would not want to give. We want to spread the message that use of the internet can bring great advantages.<br><br>
We have therefore built on an approach which, although self-regulatory, is based on the existing law of the land. I receive quite a lot of correspondence from Members of Parliament passing on letters from constituents who are worried about the internet being totally unregulated. I always reply that there is no difference between the law of the land on line and off line: the law is technology neutral. Harmful or illegal material will be dealt with by the law of the land.<br><br>
The Committee will be aware that the Government support the Internet Watch Foundation, which works with industry and works very closely with the Home Office. It was backed by the previous Government and we have continued to support it. Indeed, I have asked for a review of its activities, to see whether we can extend them. Therefore, the police, the Home Office, the Government and the industry are involved in the industry's self-regulatory approach. We always keep an open mind and shall ensure that further legislation is introduced, if necessary.<br><br>
The industry has taken a similar self-regulatory approach to audiovisual and information services. As my hon. Friend will know, there is a live debate on the subject in Euorpe at the moment. I am glad to say that it is a key area where the UK is providing a valuable lead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed an important subject, and the Minister has answered helpfully so far. We readily make allowances for the fact that she is operating at the margin of her departmental interest, but can she clarify—although it is pretty clear from the explanatory memorandum—that the Government are happy with the idea of a European Council recommendation on the protection of minors and human dignity and that they hope to secure an agreement on it during their presidency?<br><br>
However, there is one glitch in relation to the legal base. The Council's Legal Service has queried the use of article 130(3) because it is a competition article. Can the Minister tell the Committee whether that glitch has now been ironed out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The matter was raised, but I understand that, following discussions with the Commission and the UK presidency and some amendments to the text of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Council working group, the Council's Legal Service has now withdrawn its reservations and is content. I certainly hope that we can make progress and reach agreement. I shall check on the progress so far and make it known to the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee. We are keen to make progress—as we shall with the Telecoms Council in May—because of the effect on the use of the internet. Ministers with responsibility for telecommunications are also keen to make similar progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These issues are of hugely significant importance to millions of people, yet it appears that they are largely unreported. How would the Minister suggest that the Government work with industry and the media to open the debate to the public?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has posed one of the key questions that faces us. The document has many ramifications and covers many matters. Quite apart from the inevitable changes in our social and cultural life, it proposes considerable changes for our economic life. One effect of one part of it could be that the increasing convergence of IT industries, telecoms and broadcasting will affect our economic and business life and result in many new industries being established.<br><br>
There is also a good opportunity for the UK to win a strong competitive position for itself, because convergence will mean that all those content industries will become increasingly important. Historically, the UK has been strong in its content industries. We have only to think of our traditional skills in film making. There are probably few American blockbuster films to which British firms have not contributed. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell), this could be one way of engaging public debate. We shall soon hold our own consultations, and I hope that that will add to public discussion. My hon. Friend is right to say that the subject is vital to the country's future; I agree that it needs the widest possible debate among the public and industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The paper focuses on competition in the European Union. It refers to opportunities for job creation and growth through convergence. Are the Government also alert to the international dimension and the potential for the export of jobs and growth through the increasing use of electronic commerce and electronic media? In view of that threat, do the Government have a view about the dangers posed by the relatively strong regulation of the labour market, the relatively high taxation within the European Union and the threat to those mechanisms from electronic commerce based outside the EU? Do they foresee potential attempts at protectionism hindering the freeing up of electronic media in EU member states that perceive its development as a threat to the social structure of their economies and their taxation bases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman poses an interesting question. I chaired the Telecoms Council in February. There was a fascinating discussion among Ministers from all member states on what approach to take. There was a desire for differing approaches and for a light regulatory touch in some areas. Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0340">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
states feel that if the matter is handled correctly there is potential for wealth and job creation. There will be many opportunities for entrepreneurship.<br><br>
I take a more optimistic view of electronic commerce than the hon. Gentleman. There are many challenges—let us make no mistake about that. However, if we get electronic commerce right, smaller UK companies, our small and medium-sized enterprises, will be able to take advantage of the new technologies to export and expand. It will revolutionise the way in which we think of the supply chain.<br><br>
We shall need many discussions on electronic commerce, in relation to such matters as cultural diversity, which is a strong and understandable desire of many member states. It is important for Ministers in the European Union to understand that the new technologies and the digital revolution will benefit everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the law is technology neutral. Does that also apply to the laws governing competition and monopolies? Does current or forthcoming legislation deal with the issues that we are discussing today? Was the competition legislation that the House will be debating over the coming months framed with such issues in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Competition Bill that is currently going through Parliament was framed to take account of these matters. That will be useful, as will the responses to the Green Paper on the utilities. Furthermore, we shall introduce a consultation document, which will engender public debate, and will ensure that we adopt the correct framework. That is important not only for the present, but for the future. We face that challenge in the Committee and in Parliament as a whole. It is a fast-moving area and we must get the framework right for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware of the media speculation that tax revenue in the developed world might emigrate through the internet? Companies could trade from low-tax areas in far away countries. Has this possible long-term trend been discussed at the European level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we have said, those issues are relevant at a European and a global level. I am sure that they will be raised at the Bonn and Ottawa conferences. We start from a position that is technology neutral, but we must look carefully at such matters as convergence and the speed with which transactions can move across national frontiers and beyond European Union boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain interconnection to the Committee? It is not clear from the documents. Does she agree that one of the drivers towards convergence will be switch-based resellers? They will offer a range of different technologies—perhaps single switches, voice-fixed data and mobile—and interconnection will be important. Will fully
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
distributive costs or incremental costs form the basis for designing regulations for interconnection between existing mobile networks?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can give a technical opinion, but the hon. Gentleman is right to mention interconnection. The deregulation of the telecoms market, not only in the United Kingdom, but elsewhere in the European Union, partly drives the debate. The hon. Gentleman will have seen the interconnection directive. The single market must be fully implemented for that to work. New entrants must be able to move into new markets, and interconnection should be as swift as possible. The date of 1 January 1998 has passed, and must be followed by implementation.<br><br>
The Commission's great task—and that of the UK presidency, which will be handed on to our Austrian colleagues, and all member states—is to ensure that implementation works in principle. Therefore, we must support the Commission when it makes its regular reports on implementation. The hon. Gentleman made an important point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister to comment on an important aspect of our debate. We have considered information and technology skills, which are important to access. But the pricing framework is also important. Will that be discussed in the negotiations to ensure that it allows access to as many people as possible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Access is important. The answer that I gave to the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) is relevant to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coakes). Access is connected to liberalisation, which we should encourage because it leads to falling prices. They encourage access to the internet.<br><br>
Liberalisation is helpful, but it is not the only answer. We must show the economic, social and cultural benefits of the internet. Therefore, programmes such as "IT for all" are important. The initiative, "Programme for Business" has learning centres, often in the business link network, and encourages small businesses to use new technology.<br><br>
Prices are not the only barriers. Often, small firms have new technology, but do not use it fully. They are so busy with the day-to-day running of their businesses, that using IT sometimes seems like a bit of a luxury. We need to convey the message that IT is central to a business. Learning centres can help to promote that. We need to pursue several factors in that context. However, the Government can add some value by speaking about and promoting IT. That is why we are pleased to have conducted benchmarking studies of the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To follow on from the question by the hon. Member for Gedling and to keep questions focused on the perhaps rather mundane aspect of the business comprising the local loop and access to the network, I wonder whether I am correct in thinking that while BT still charges substantial premium prices for the installation of ISDN lines in the United
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0341">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Kingdom, in other European Union states ISDN provision is universal. Do the Government plan to deal with that problem? Do they see it as a potential impediment to the growth of those technologies in the United Kingdom, likely to place it at a competitive disadvantage in the European Union?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think so. In a comparison of the penetration of internet use in this country and in the rest of the European Union, the United Kingdom does well. As for transmitting by ISDN, we shall be able to receive internet services and digital technology by a variety of means. We are keen to promote competition in this sphere. Promoting competition in infrastructure services will enable us to achieve the take-up that we want.<br><br>
I remind the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) that, as I told my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling, it is important to communicate the case for use of the new information and communication products. That is vital to the achievement of the necessary take-up and penetration.<br><br>
My saying that the United Kingdom is doing very well does not mean that we should not learn from what is happening in the rest of the European Union. I have been impressed by some of the projects in other member states. Sweden and Finland provide good examples, particularly in work done with schools, which has demonstrated the information revolution. The United Kingdom is playing a full part in what is happening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of information, I do not think that many countries have universal ISDN. [HON. MEMBERS: "Germany."] Germany—possibly.<br><br>
My question relates to the passage on page 24 of the Green Paper, under the heading "Conditional access systems", which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Browsers and search engines are inherently independent … Recently, however, competition concerns have been raised about the possibility of Browsers being packaged with other software or even becoming fully integrated to the software itself."</p></blockquote>
That relates to what is widely reported to be a forthcoming court case in the United States, to be brought by the trade Department against Microsoft for bundling the Internet Explorer into Windows. The case will have a major impact on the industry, however it goes.<br><br>
The Green paper states, cautiously:
<br><blockquote><p>"An extension of the principles already applied to the digital television field with the object of ensuring that new entrants will not be excluded from access to such systems should be considered."</p></blockquote>
The attitude of the parties in the court case might be relevant in this context. Microsoft knows that the European Union will go one way or the other; it could be influenced. Will the Minister discuss the matter with her colleagues?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The relevant areas of competition policy are important. My hon. Friend refers to a Department of Justice case in the United States, which is still pending. As he said, the Green Paper raises an interesting issue. This is another example of how good
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
the Green Paper is in focusing the mind on complex issues. Technical issues are discussed clearly and concisely.<br><br>
The overriding principle is that there must be competition. At the end of the day, that will deliver the best result both for consumers and for industry. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) and the Committee may also wish to know that when Telecoms Ministers meet at the Council, we are fortunate in that both Commissioner Bangemann, who is responsible for telecoms, and Commissioner Van Miert, who is responsible for competition policy, frequently attend our deliberations, which is always helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At various points in the helpful notes in preparation for a response that the Minister has provided—she will have noticed that Conservative Members find much to commend in the Green Paper—there are some references to national contexts and others to international, global contexts. How does the Minister envisage convergence, not only of technologies and services but between the World Trade Organisation, the International Telecommunications Union and the European Union? What role does she see the EU playing in attempting to achieve global liberalisation on a basis that will allow convergence of mobile telephone systems—the "mobile satelite—and others to work, not only in the EU but globally?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point, as did the hon. Member for Daventry earlier. Some issues are rightly viewed as a matter for national regulation. I provided earlier the example of licences, to which deregulation and achieving a single market in telecoms could be added. Other issues, such as copyright and intellectual property rights, are clearly world wide.<br><br>
Much discussion is currently taking place between the EU and the OECD about preparations for the Ottowa conference, in which the issues raised by the hon. Member for West Dorset are relevant. We need to identify which issues should be for the UK, which for the European Union and which need to be addressed in a world-wide context. It is not easy, but we are anxious to resolve and make progress on those difficult issues. There is already some agreement in the WTO on the basic telecoms network issues.<br><br>
I may not have heard the hon. Member for West Dorset correctly, but I believe that he asked about what he called the mobile satellite. In this sector there are many regulatory bodies, and the UK is actively involved with them. For example, the Radio communications Agency takes a leading role in representing the UK and also in the implementation of policy. I thought that the hon. Gentleman might have referred to third generation mobile phones, but I shall not take the liberty of replying if he did not. However, if we can get the world standard right in this sector, it would be advantageous not only for the EU but for UK industries, which is why we are keen to promote it.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I return to the policing of some of the technologies, particularly the internet? I welcome the Minister's statement that the law applies equally on-line and off-line. I am sure that she knows that national newspapers have attempted to use the fact that information is illegally available on the internet as a justification for publishing it. For example, the fact that the identities of young people involved in criminal investigations have been made available on the internet has been used to justify their publication in national newspapers. Can she reassure us that the availability of illegal information will not undermine the application of the general law for the newspaper industry? That would be a real cause for concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have a technology-neutral approach, and the existing law of the land applies. We are keen to make progress in this area. It involves only a small proportion of material on the internet, but some of it is illegal and highly worrying, particularly the child pornography. We all want to see that dealt with in the strongest possible manner, which is why organisation such as the Internet Watch Foundation are working closely with the police and the Home Office. There is no room for complacency. We want the existing law of the land to apply. We always keep an open mind about whether there is any need for regulations. The increasing filtering and rating of bits of technology will also help parents to control the material that their children see on the internet. While that is not the whole answer, it can make a helpful contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Staying on the same theme, may I take the discussion on not to harmful or illegal material, but to material that infringes the law in one member state or another? I am thinking in particular of the absurd situation recently in which material was available on the internet and had been published in other EU member states, yet newspapers in this country were not allowed to publish it. Material published in one member country might infringe the strict French privacy laws. Even more bizarrely, some member states have rules concerning the publication of political opinion polls in the run-up to elections; such information could be made available on electronic media. Does the Minister believe that there will be pressure to harmonise the legal position across member states in response to the availability of this information in electronic media? Can she give the Committee an assurance that the toughest rules in each area will not eventually be brought to apply across the whole European Union, and that we will not find ourselves burdened with the whole gamut of French privacy laws?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not see that happening. The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. There are certainly no European Union proposals on that. His example of opinion polls is a good and interesting one. It illustrates that with the dawning of the information age, each member state will want to consider its own systems in the light of what new technology brings. But the principles that we would adopt are exactly the same
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
as those for the internet, which are that the law that applies on-line is exactly the same as the law that applies off-line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was reassured to hear the Minister speak in her opening statement of information-rich people and information-poor people. Will she say a little more about the Government's thinking on that subject?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes; it is probably one of the biggest questions that faces us, and it affects several Departments. The Department of Trade and Industry has the "IT for all" initiative and the "Programme for Business" initiative, which is often located within the business link network. The Department for Education and Employment has the national grid for learning and the development proposals for the university for industry. Other Departments are considering other aspects. It is a key issue. Few jobs have no need of some basic IT skills. Being a Member of Parliament may be one of the few.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not for long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says, not long long—because although we may not use the new technology, our offices are certainly dependent on it.<br><br>
We need to get across two messages. First, we need to be sure not only that more people have access to the new technology but that they feel familiar and comfortable with it and are not frightened of it. I came across a project the other day that was aimed at improving the IT skills of older people, some of whom want to use it for social or leisure reasons, while others want to start their own businesses.<br><br>
Secondly, we must make the technology much more friendly and easier to use, which is a challenge to the IT industry. All of us are good at using the telephone. We are operating a complex piece of machinery, yet we are not frightened of it or intimidated by it. The great challenge is to ensure that, as the industry progresses, the technology becomes easier to use and that people do not feel apprehensive about it.<br><br>
I hope that I have given my hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Mr. Twigg) some idea of how we can bridge the gap, so that everyone can feel included and welcome the opportunity that the information age can offer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us what she thinks are the implications for cross-media ownership rules when those rules are quite different in various European Union countries? In that context, the Minister spoke about future-proofing newly developed systems; technology is developing fast, but the law must not be left behind. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the Competition Bill has been adequately drafted with a view to future-proofing the convergence between information technology, media and telecommunications?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Competition Bill of course reflects the Government's thinking, and I hope that that will give the hon. Gentleman some reassurance. Questions of cross-media ownership were extensively canvassed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0343">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
during the passage through Parliament of the Broadcasting Act 1996. In this case, we are looking at the spin-offs of technology. The present revolution is dictated not by questions of ownership or of what market forces are doing, but by technology. This sitting of the Committee and the responses to the Green Paper will be helpful in deciding how convergance is to be addressed—not just in technological terms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the Minister's comments about phones. I remember the instruction to push button A or button B—[<i>Interruption.</i>]—although not, as one of my hon. Friends said, the line being closed. That just shows how technology moves on. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary mentioned consultation with industry. Will she tell us a little more about what consultation is taking place and what is the industry's attitude to the Green Paper—which, I think that most of us agree, is a good document?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend is far too young to remember what he describes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So is the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Atkinson, I am going to repeat that because I want it on the record. The hon. Gentleman gallantly said, "So is the Minister." I am very grateful to him.<br><br>
We have consulted industry extensively about the Green Paper, as has the Commission. I know that Commissioner Bangemann regularly consults the industry in round-table discussions, which is welcome. In our outline draft document, we have tried to include industry's preliminary responses. The general response is that this is an incredibly complex area that is moving quickly, so it is difficult to predict the outcome in a few years' time.<br><br>
Industry appreciates what the Commission is trying to achieve in the document, but it wants the Government to provide it with a framework for competitiveness, so that there can be new entrants into newly emerging markets. It is important that we do not inhibit newer industries, some of which may be difficult to predict, but which we would want to emerge in the European Union and especially in the UK.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the advent of digital broadcasting, it will be possible to release spectrum from analogue services. How can we make use of such released spectrum? Do the Government have any plans in that area?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important issue. It is too early to predict what will happen to analogue spectrum. We will need to consult widely on that question, but it will not arise for some time. Of course, we will consult widely on future use of such spectrum when it becomes available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's answers, reference is made in the paper to the European Union needing to co-ordinate an analogue switch-off date—I take it that refers not only to telephony but to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
broadcasting services. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the UK will resist any attempt to impose a switch-off date, which would place a burden on consumers by requiring them to replace equipment the life of which had not yet expired?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman may know, the Government are consulting on a joint report, which has been sponsored partly by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and partly by the Radiocommunications Agency, which comes within the ambit of the Department of Trade and Industry. There will be widespread consultation on that.<br><br>
We would not want there to be any switch-off until digital equipment is common in people's homes, much as analogue equipment is now. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall pay strong heed to the views of consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That brings us to the end of the time allotted to questions. We now move to the debate.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 13289/97. a Commission Green Paper on the convergency of the telecommunications, media and information technology sectors, and the implications for regulation: <i>Towards an Information Society Approach:</i> shares the Commission's assessment of the importance of convergence to support the development of the information society: welcomes the Commission's recognition that the development of convergence provides substantial opportunities for job creation and growth; and notes that the Government intends shortly to launch a consultation on the future regulation of broadcasting and telecommunications in the United Kingdom.—[<i>Mrs. Roche.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regard the Commission's Green Paper as an entirely splendid document and that the Government's response to it—based, as the Minister acknowledged, on proposals being developed under the previous Administration—is pretty good, too. I need not belabour the Committee with a lot of politics.<br><br>
We must start with the reality that convergence is taking place willy-nilly. I confess a relative technical inadequacy in such matters. I am by no means a technophobe, but I am only now beginning to psych myself up to work up an internet entry. That is the direction in which most of us, as Members of Parliament, will be going.<br><br>
I am reminded of my definition of a computer nerd. The moment of crossover is the point at which a computer nerd ceases to be someone who knows much about computers and becomes someone who knows nothing about computers. I always thought it healthy, in those long-forgotten button A and button B days when I studied the classical languages, that I did so under a notice, copied from the motto on the door of the school of Alexandria, that advised me in ancient Greek, "Let no one with no knowledge of geometry enter here." That is right, because IT skills are key, as the Minister agrees, and we, as older persons, must be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
aware of that. We must facilitate the opportunities that are emerging for our generation, too, because they are emerging so quickly.<br><br>
The assertion, which has not been mentioned, in the Green Paper that more personal computers than televisions will be sold this year is remarkable. Without making a final judgment, the Green Paper rightly touches on the issue of whether the change will be TV driven, involving set-top boxes, or whether it will be PC driven. Those are interesting, but essentially technical, issues. Having recently done some work on digital audio broadcasting, I know that audio technology might be attractive because of the ability to reduce costs through using a relatively inexpensive card that can be bolted to the computer, allowing two things to be used at once.<br><br>
I should like to get another issue out of the way, not because it is unimportant it is extremely important. Both Opposition and Labour Members have mentioned the question of what is communicated. Clearly there is continuing concern about the availability of damaging, unattractive and positively dangerous material. It must be realised that such material exists and is used. I remember reading recently that a certain hard-core porn website based in the United States is the most visited website on the internet. It is difficult to deal with such problems. It would be difficult to do so even if we began to criminalise the users, for example. However, we must do everything that we can—primarily through self-regulation—to try to curtail such activity and create a cultural climate in which it becomes a less obvious means of recreational recourse because there are better things to look at.<br><br>
I shall touch on the centralisation, decentralisation argument. It is important to realise that these technologies should be liberating, in the best sense of the word, and should provide opportunities for minority interests—not the disreputable kind, but minority languages, cultures or whatever it may be—to communicate among themselves, either through a closed user group or openly. That is a great asset, although there is some concern about whether such technologies affect family cohesion, because people go up to their rooms to use their computers instead of sitting in a family group in front of the television.<br><br>
I leave those thoughts, because they are in a sense speculative, and return to the main industrial issues that are the substance of the Green Paper. We are glad that the Government's general approach is clear, because the main input should come from industry rather than from Government. Industry is closer to the evolving market and to the technical aspects of development, and of course those two interact: as the technology changes, so the market expands. The Government, and even at first instance the regulator, are in a sense second-order players, because they come along behind the technology. There is a constant need to be alert to what is happening and to catch up where it is appropriate. As we said in the context of pornography or unacceptable material, we must
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
accept that it is difficult for governments, whether at national, EU or global level to catch up with some of the changes, because the technology moves very fast.<br><br>
Therefore, the European Union's approach—of producing a Green Paper, which is essentially facilitative and not conscriptive, and then for it and our national Government to consult users—is the right one. The eventual framework must be able to be adapted over time and must be flexible. The only thing that I have against a framework is that, having set one up, we might say "Haven't we done a great job?" then stand away from it and say "We don't need to revisit it" because we may quickly need to revisit some of the areas to get them right.<br><br>
In that context, I welcome the Commission's statement of principles set out in chapter V, on pages 33 and 34. The five principles are entirely sensible. It is no accident, not least because we are in a highly technically influenced area, that the present Government's approach in the UK evolves from their predecessor's. That is one reason we find it convenient. I particularly want to commend the Government on their emphasis in the explanatory memorandum on subsidiarity, on which we have touched, and, as the Minister has also said in exchanges, on UK interests. This country has been at the forefront of setting up deregulatory regimes for telecoms, which have hugely advanced the adoption of technology; we have a powerful manufacturing sector in a number of areas which can clearly benefit and we have a relatively high computer awareness. Those are all strengths on which we need to build, which the flexibility advocated by the Green Paper would enable us to do.<br><br>
The different options set out by the Green Paper to find solutions create some difficulties in over-arching concepts. For example, if the concept is technology-driven by a horizontal approach—in other words if all these things are doing the same job teleologically, but there are different technical solutions, because one comes from a computer, one is a piece of broadcasting and one is a piece of telecom technology—there may be difficulties in fitting it together, not least at the European level, where there will, by definition, be 15 Administrations with slightly different approaches and different institutional arrangements.<br><br>
As is my wont in this Committee, I should like to flag up the fact that the word enlargement does not appear in these documents. The possiblity of another 11 members with different public law and technological development standards adds to the complexity of what might be called an integrative or holistic approach. As things develop, the basic approach should be to bolt on to the existing national regimes and to look at areas where European intervention may be appropriate, not least to represent the position of the 15 Administrations internationally. The global side should also be considered as it is bound to be important.<br><br>
The Green Paper notes:
<br><blockquote><p>"Increasingly matters concerning electronic commerce need to be treated at international level. National regimes will need to adapt to convergence as it affects them. The key Community role is to promote further liberalisation."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0345">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
That is right and what the Community is about. Some things such as technical standards will have to be settled at an international level: aspects of commercial law are clearly important as the internet becomes a vehicle for international transactions. The approach needs to be open and evolutionary rather than seeking huge areas in which we can produce what the Germans would call a "Gesamtkonzept", trying to put it all together, then driving it back. We in the UK, if the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) will forgive me, are liberals on these matters and long may that continue. We want an open system.<br><br>
The Community's role, which is what we are always looking at in this Committee, should be to concentrate on promoting further liberalisation. The documents show that that is seen to some extent as moving forward the principles of the open market and stimulating the laggards within the existing EU 15. The stakes are high and that is where the document is refreshingly positive. The introduction to the Green Paper is so good that it is worth repeating: amazingly enough it also appears in the conclusions as the Commission thought so too. The most positive statement is:
<br><blockquote><p>"If Europe can embrace these changes by creating an environment which supports rather than holds back the process of change we will have created a powerful motor for job creation and growth, increasing consumer choice and promoting cultural diversity."</p></blockquote>
That is all very good. It goes on to say that if Europe fails to do that there will be certain disturbing consequences.<br><br>
This is one of those rare occasions on which we can all more or less sign up. There will be reservations and issues which the Minister has to take forward and sort out. Constant alertness will be needed and the issues will need to be revisited on occasion. Covergence is a bus that we collectively in Britian, in Europe, and globally need to catch. The role of the Committee in our discussions and questions is to see what sort of bus it is, how many passengers are going to go along with us and to what fare stages. We can then define how we get the vehicle to go forward—but go forward it must.</span></p>
<p>11.44 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first welcome the Government's draft response to this extremely important document on areas of immense complexity. There is a cross-party view in the Committee that that is the case. I should like to emphasise for my hon. Friend the Minister one or two aspects of concern, the first of which concerns the sections on dominant market position.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge spoke about cross-media ownership. I browsed through the document while at the same time hearing reports of Rupert Murdoch's recent speech. He welcomed the document—which flagged up warning signals for me. I could not help but reflect that Mr. Murdoch and those like him favour market forces and liberal regimes provided that they own them. Bearing in mind what has happened in Britain, with the media especially—there is BBC television and, effectively,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
Carlton and Granada control the rest—there is great emphasis on an almost single dominant cross-media ownership of those important areas.<br><br>
The document states that the Commission is determined not to allow agreements or mergers whose effect would be to foreclose markets and create dominant possessions. I welcome that, but I urge my hon. Friend to ensure that it happens. There is a need for early warning systems in the negotiations.<br><br>
The second point relates to the balance between regulation and the market. The Commission's Green Paper lays emphasis on the market. It refers to market responses and solutions to barriers perhaps being more appropriate than any regulation. While it is right to have a light licensing regime and we are right in aiming to liberalise these areas—there is agreement on that—there is a great difference between market responses and a liberal regime. The latter can be as liberal as possible and the licensing system can have as light a touch as possible. However, almost to discount regimes of regulation, where they are appropriate, and be they light or heavy, in favour of market solutions—as the document seems to suggest—would cause considerable concern.<br><br>
The other issue in the Government's draft response is subsidiarity. The term brings to mind integrated transport. We first raised the subject of integrated transport at the 1948 party conference. We did not know what it meant then; I wait to see whether we know now. I have the feeling that subsidiarity is falling into that category. While I welcome the Government's emphasis on it, as we all do, I am not sure that the Commission understands it. The document gives us and opportunity to make clear to the Commission what subsidiarity means. I have tried my best to identify a Commission initiative that has tried to quantify it but have not found one. I do not think that the Commission is interested in subsidiarity. I say that not in any critical sense but because I think that it is a fact. That point is important, especially as the document provides a sting in the tail of subsidiarity. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the barriers resulted from measures which are fully consistent with the Treaty"</p></blockquote>
and we should note the phrase "fully consistent"—
<br><blockquote><p>"and where principles of mutual recognition could not be applied."—</p></blockquote>
hon. Members can interpret that in whatever way they choose—
<br><blockquote><p>"Community measures (such as harmonising legislation) might be justified."</p></blockquote>
Bingo! The Government's correct emphasis on subsidiarity becomes meaningless as far as the Commission is concerned, if we accept that statement at face value. We can interpret that paragraph in any way that we choose, but the sting is there. The intention is clear. Unless things have changed since my 10 years as a member of the Commission between 1984 and 1994, people will be beavering away—not in the Berlaymont building, but whichever building they are now in—to determine what the Commission means by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0346">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
measures that might require harmonisation. The Government must set out what they mean by subsidiarity at an early stage.<br><br>
My final point relates to public service broadcasting, which is almost dismissed in the document. Although there are many pages dealing with competition, regulation, market forces and goodness knows what else, there are only four paragraphs on public service broadcasting.<br><br>
There are a number of reasons for that. One was reflected in Mr. Murdoch's views on the BBC and public service broadcasting. He said recently that public broadcasters were a set of dinosaurs who stopped entrepreneurs, such as him, entering the market. He is entitled to that opinion, but what worries me is that the Commission might share it. If that should be the case, my hon. Friend the Minister would do the country and the House a service by making it clear that it is not the UK Government's view.<br><br>
Another reason for the lack of consideration of public service broadcasting is that on the continent the concept of such broadcasting, especially television, is not the same as in the UK. The Commission document states that public service broadcasting will have a difficult time. It will not be able to compete with pay-as-you-view and cable services. That is worrying. If we are not careful, there will be some people who are media and information rich, but others will be poor.<br><br>
Progressive and positive public service broadcasting is important for cultural and other reasons, and also to ensure a balanced provision so that access to the media is available to all. I fully support, therefore, the section in the draft response relating to the application of existing provisions on competition. It states that they
<br><blockquote><p>"should deliver satisfactory access to networks though, in certain cases, a common protected system may be preferable to guarantee public interest."</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely right. I repeat that this is an important issue and that it is almost dismissed in the document.</span></p>
<p>11.53 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a broad consensus on this issue, and on the appropriateness of the Government's response, as other hon. Members have said. I should like to elaborate on one or two points that have been made.<br><br>
I am especially concerned about the mechanisms for enforcement. The Minister referred to the importance of a common legal base for on-line and off-line services. We have also discussed future-proofing of systems and of regulatory regimes. As such debates develop, the Government must ensure that the resulting laws regarding electronic media are not honoured only in the breach. That will bring the law into disrepute and create serious anomalies. They already exist; for example, some information cannot be published in the print media, but is readily available from the electronic media. That is what hon. Members mean by the division of society into the information
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
rich and the information poor. Some people have access to information while others do not, because the less technological media are prevented from publishing some information.<br><br>
As I said in my earlier question, I am worried about the potential erosion not only of the tax base, which other hon. Members have mentioned, but of the employment base in the EU. I acknowledge the potential of the electronics era for generating growth and employment, especially in a relatively highly educated society. I hope that I am not an unmitigated pessimist, but the Minister is a little too optimistic. She should realise that many services will be cheaper to generate electronically outside the EU, because of its high labour costs. We must accept that more and more information that we receive electronically in the EU could have value added to them in countries such as India, where technical skills are high and labour costs are extremely low.<br><br>
Jobs in the EU will be threatened as convergence takes place. It is difficult to envisage a rosy future for the postman in 2050. Employment will also be challenged in less obvious areas.<br><br>
The jobs of those at the lower end of the scale of educational achievement will come under particular threat. I am worried about the reaction of the citizens and Governments of EU countries when the threat is realised. The United Kingdom is an instinctively liberalising nation. We must be alert to a potentially protectionist stance by Governments of other member states to protect jobs and tax bases. I hope that that will not happen, but we must be aware of the possibility of electronic Luddism in the next millennium.<br><br>
We have not yet discussed the potential impact of information technology on the political situations in countries that have more oppressive regimes than those in the EU. We must be aware of the risk of pressure on western Governments by regimes that do not want their citizens to have access to the vast range of information that the electronic media can provide. I hope that the British Government will brush aside such pressures and that we will do our best to ensure that there is no division between the information rich and the information poor not only in the EU, but in the world.<br><br>
Earlier, I mentioned information that is not harmful or illegal, but that transgresses the rules of a nation state. Information technology will drive convergence more effectively than any political discussions, unions or agreements between nation states. In the next 20 or 30 years, convergence in the market for goods and services will occur. Perhaps there will also be pressure for convergence of the laws and regulations of different states as the non-electronic world has to create a level playing field with the services, goods and information available in the electronic world. I fear that it will not be possible to regulate the electronic world as politicians would want, so they will have no choice but to deregulate the non-electronic world.<br><br>
Deregulation is something to which many of us aspire and the coming convergence between telecommunications, broadcast media and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
information technology will be a great driver towards it. However, depending on one's point of view, there may be downsides to the convergence of pricing across markets; to the convergence of taxation as a result of the possibility of electronic commercial transactions; to the convergence of income taxation as a result of the possibility of sheltering through electronic media; and even to the convergence of employment regimes resulting from the difficulty of sustaining different labour costs in different countries in a world of electronic media.<br><br>
Finally, I support the Government in proposing that while regulation will be necessary to deal with access, networks and interconnectability, the regulation of content on electronic media must be done with a light hand if it is not to be self-defeating. The key is to ensure that consumers have available the information that they need to make their own informed choices and exercise a form of self-censorship regarding potentially harmful or unpleasant material.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and other hon. Members raised the important issue of the European Union's role. Some matters relate to national competence, national laws and national jurisdiction; but as soon as those are challenged or threatened by the growth of the electronic society, we move immediately into a global environment.<br><br>
Beyond representing a collective view of the member states of the European Union—if such a collective view can be achieved—there is no obvious role for the EU in this matter. I echo the sentiments of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) and hope that the Minister will ensure that we do not allow the European Commission to create a role for itself—as it has in other respects—where there is no obvious, logical or relevant role for it to play. These matters are much better dealt with at a national or global level.</span></p>
<p>12.3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo the comments of the shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Daventry, in noting that the document is well written—in English rather than a translation into something approximating to English. It certainly gives the impression that it was originally written in English and I hope that the Commission will provide more documents as readable as this one.<br><br>
I intend to emphasise many of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South, who spoke well and strongly. The balance between competition and regulation is a problem. There may be a shade of difference on the two sides of the Committee on that matter, with the Government leaning towards regulation and the Opposition towards liberalisation and competition. I shall follow my hon. Friends in emphasising regulation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a consensus debate and I do not wish to change that. May I gloss the Opposition's position as being about carefully considering regulation in order to achieve the most feasible and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
practicable means of achieving the most desirable outcome. If the hon. Gentleman is on that line, I am with him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. A consensus appears to be emerging across the Room today, especially on subsidiarity and on what needs to be done at the European, national or global level. However, I emphasise my point about regulation, because the markets are almost inherently oligopolistic at least—if not monopolistic. The big players are powerful and can squeeze out or gobble up smaller players and new entrants, if care is not taken to prevent that. The relationship is reminiscent of Sir Isaiah Berlin's phrase about the pike and the minnows. Freedom for the pike does not necessarily mean freedom for the minnow. Regulation is appropriate in those markets. Technical factors as much as commercial ones can be involved. One technology is victorious over another. Among video recorders, for example, VHS—while not necessarily even the best technology—won the market. The market is suitable for a degree of regulation. I hope that the Government will recognise that and make the point strongly in European discussions.<br><br>
I know that broadcasting is not strictly the area of expertise of my hon. Friend the Minister, and that her colleagues are unavailable, for good reasons, but I hope that my remarks on this topic will at least be passed on. I am, like my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South, very concerned about the possibility that the quality of the media in Britain could be undermined or destroyed by excessive commercialisation—particularly of television.<br><br>
Our television compares favourably with that anywhere in the world. It may be the best—I would not know about television in every country—and it is certainly near to being the best. I was fortunate enough to go to Tuscany on holiday in 1992, but had the misfortune of having to watch the Olympic games on Italian television. The quality was unbelievably low. At crucial moments, for example just as a race was finishing, advertisements would begin; the information provided was poor, and so on. The contrast between that and the BBC's sports broadcasting was staggering.<br><br>
Competition in the media—particularly television—creates a tendency to drive down costs. Driving down costs to appeal to advertisers results in cheap, poor quality programmes. Rather than an expansion of freedom, the outcome is restriction of choice for the consumer. Choice is available for the provider, but not the user, whereas competition is supposed to provide freedom of choice and wide choice for consumers. We could drift towards a lowest-common-denominator television service, comprising sport, soap operas, pop music, cheap video films, game shows, advertising and even soft porn. That might feature in the world as described by Aldous Huxley or even George Orwell, but not in the world that I would like to live in. I want to live in a world that can provide the good television that we now enjoy, with its range,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0348">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
objectivity, freedom from commercial pressures and scope for airing every point of view. That leads to genuine debate, interest and variety.<br><br>
We must protect public service broadcasting, which requires a degree of regulation. We are approaching the end of a century in which unpleasant dictatorships have given rise to a justified preoccupation with questions of the dictatorship of the state. We do not want the next century to be characterised by the dictatorship of key players in the market, by which certain individuals would control the information that we would receive—or, indeed, control our lives. Information is today more important than almost anything else. Governments of all colours are very sensitive to what is said about them in the media. Those who control the media have a big say in who governs. That is not a healthy way to start the new century. I would like the Government to stand up strongly for public service broadcasting, for independence in broadcasting, for freedom from commercial pressures and for a range of opinion in our media. If that is guaranteed, we can move forward happily into the next century.</span></p>
<p>12.10 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Colin Breed <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cornwall)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Government's response to the Green Paper, and I agree with a vast amount of what has been said this morning.<br><br>
We need to consider three critical factors. First, we live in a fast-moving technological world; indeed, technology is now moving at such a pace that it is difficult to keep up. Secondly, we all accept the need for proper access to and the liberalisation of those important services. Thirdly, we must consider how control and regulation will affect those services. The key to success is being able to develop technology in such a way as to achieve those three ends.<br><br>
Many people are worried that technology, not only in telecommunications but in medical matters and other areas, has left them behind. They feel rather impotent, because they are always trying to catch up and get ahead of the game. We introduce controls and regulations, only to find that technology has leapt on once again. That matter needs to be addressed.<br><br>
The worry is that access and liberalisation may be used to by some people to gain a dominant position and give themselves influence and a more powerful voice in all sorts of media. I agree with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South that there is widespread agreement on that matter. Of course, access and liberalisation will allow people who want to use the media in the wrong way to put on the screen things that none of us want to see—the sort of thing that can affect young people in so many different ways. We want access and liberalisation, but we must ensure that the right things get on to the screen.<br><br>
In some respects it is almost impossible to control and regulate what will happen. We all know what we would like to do, and we all want the so-called light touch, but regulation and control will still be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
necessary. That, however, will require a considerable amount of co-operation. I do not believe that any one country, or even Europe as a whole, will be able to maintain the necessary regulation and control over those who would use the internet for their own ends.<br><br>
To get the fast-moving technologies of telecommunications working for us in the right way, we will need access and liberalisation. We need to ensure that cost, regulation, lack of education and so on do not put a barrier in the way of that, but we also need to ensure, through co-operative regulation and control, that those valuable services provide what we want, rather than what we do not want.<br><br>
The Green Paper is extremely readable, and I hope that it will provide the basis for our contribution in Europe. We have perhaps the longest history in communications. As the hon. Member for Luton, North, said, our development of public service broadcasting, the quality of our services and the way in which we have developed our telecommunications mean that we can give a lead in Europe. I hope that we do.</span></p>
<p>12.14 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to keep my remarks brief, because there is a great deal of consensus on the subject, and I shall restrict what I say to matters on which I may introduce a note of dissent—that is usually the job of the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin).<br><br>
I am worried that the principle underlying the Green Paper may be one with which I disagree. I may be wrong, but it appears that its underlying principle is that the future of such technology is predictable and that somehow it can be managed, controlled and regulated. We can predict the future of the industry and regulate it only in the sense that we can control a tiger and prevent it from biting us by hanging on to its tail—we can do that for only so long; pretty soon we will have two handfuls of hair and no leg. That is how the industry works.<br><br>
We have seen the pace of change in the industry, and seen generations of technology come and go. For example, after the war, the mainframe computer dominated, and everyone was convinced that it would rule the world for ever. It lasted for about 20 years before the minicomputer destroyed it. Everybody then said that the minicomputer would rule the world forever, until the micrcomputer and the personal computer came along. Now everybody is saying that they will rule the world for ever. The predecessor of today's computers came on the market in 1984, and I doubt whether today's generation of technology will succeed far into the next millennium. Something else will come along, and not one of us knows what it will be.<br><br>
We have talked about broadcasting today—but I would bet the Committee that there will be no such thing as broadcasting in 2020, and probably sooner than that. Why should I have to watch the latest adventures of Deirdre Rachid—to find out whether she will be locked away for six months or for six minutes—at the same time this evening as other hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Members? Why cannot I watch the programme at a time that suits me? In the next millennium, we will see not broadcasting but "pointcasting". Why should I have to watch football matches at the same time as the rest of the Committee does? I may want to watch football matches live, or I may want to delay watching Liverpool thrashing Manchester United until a time when I will not be disturbed by the Division Bell just as Robbie Fowler is scoring the winning goal.<br><br>
The whole industry will change under our feet; we cannot predict how it will change, and we should not try to do so. Every time that we have tried to predict and control the industry in the past, it has been a disaster.<br><br>
I shall now reveal myself as something of a cyber-anarchist. I do not believe, either, that we can control much of what happens on the internet. An earlier question mentioned the business of the Home Secretary's son's name being broadcast on the internet, and suggested that we might have to regulate such activity. I know of at least two ways in which hon. Members could have discovered the name of that gentleman; one was to sit in the Tea Room and ask a pal. Are we to regulate tea and fruitcake because going to the Tea Room was a way of discovering information that should not have been disseminated? I doubt it. Information will be available and we cannot control it.<br><br>
Let us set up a general framework for competition, decency and control of the dissemination of information. Let us, as my hon. Friend the Minister said, keep that absolutely technologically neutral. Let us try to restrict it to basic principles, and let us hope that as technology moves forward we can adapt those principles to meet the challenges of new technology. It may be that that is what is intended by the Green Paper; that is certainly one interpretation of it. Let us never kid ourselves that we can control technology or that we have the slightest clue where it is going. The world 20 years from now may not include Parliament as we know it today; even the need for Members of Parliament may have been swept away.</span></p>
<p>12.19 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have stressed the role of public service broadcasting, and have gone so far as to say that Britain leads the world in such broadcasting. It used to, but I have personal experience of television and radio in the three Scandinavian countries, and in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and they are all superior to Britain in public service broadcasting. Britain's television broadcasting is dominated by game shows and comedies to an extent that would be incredible to anyone on the continent. That is all a matter of taste, and I am well aware that hon. Members might disagree, but I mention it because commercial pressure is forcing the BBC in that direction.<br><br>
The BBC is forced to compete with the other channels because successive Governments have told it that it needs to preserve a respectable market share. We must decide what we want to do about that. Do we want the BBC simply to be market driven, in which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
case it might as well be private, or do we want it to have a specific public service role, in which case we must define what that is?<br><br>
The main question that I want to raise is content control, which several hon. Members have gingerly touched on. As the hon. Member for South Thanet has said, it is difficult, if not impossible, to exercise any content control. The examples usually given are relatively minor—such as rumours about Princess Diana or the naming of the Home Secretary's son—but some cases are relatively serious. I shall give some concrete examples. It is possible to access child sex on the internet. It is possible to access neo-Nazi sites based in Denmark, which has a particularly broad view of freedom of expression. I mention that because Denmark is within the European Union. It is also possible to access information helpful to those wanting to commit violent crime—for example, information on how to make a bomb.<br><br>
I accept that it is difficult to do anything about any of those examples. However, I am pretty relaxed about the soft-core sites that people tend to get worked up about. I always tell children that if they look for nudes on the internet, they will find that they are the slowest nudes that they have ever seen.<br><br>
The message that I want to pass to the Minister is that the European Union has a role as a lobby group in world-wide discussions on what limits should be set on the information available on the internet. I agree with the hon. Menmber for South Thanet that such limits should be pretty relaxed, as are those on what we can send one another through the post and what we can read in newspapers. However, most people across the world would accept that the line should be drawn somewhere. I balance that by stressing that the internet is predominantly a force for good. It is predominantly a tool that allows people to access information to an extent that has not been seen before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his earlier remarks the hon. Gentleman acknowledged the difficulty, if not impossibility, of policing content, but he has just said that most people would want to draw the line somewhere. They might want to do so, but can he give the Minsiter any practical advice on how to enforce that line when it is drawn?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Content provisions always originate somewhere. The problem is that they usually originate somewhere that it hard to get at. If the European Union put pressure on a country—Guyana springs to mind in connection with telephone sex—it might take more notice than if Britain, or the hon. Gentleman and I, put pressure on it. That also answers the question of whether the European Union has a role; because the EU is a large body, it might have a certain weight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about my hon. Friend, but my father laid down rules about what sort of magazines I could bring into the home. However, I could have bought the magazines that he had banned at the local newsagent and hidden them under my bed. Surely it is exactly the same with the internet; parents will have to lay down rules about what children may
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
and may not access, and children, being children, may break those rules. If they do, they will have to deal with their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To a large extent, yes. That will certainly apply to soft porn and suchlike—which, throughout history, children have looked into a little more than their parents might have wished. Neo-Nazism, violence and child pornography are perhaps areas relating more to adult viewers, when parents are no longer around. I do not want to labour the point, but it is a proper issue for the European Union to address.<br><br>
I believe that the European Union should also stress the positive role of the medium and take the initiative to supplement our own national grid for learning with similar European-wide learning tools, so that we can all become used to the idea that the internet is a Euro-friendly as well as a world-friendly medium, that it goes naturally with the Community and that we are using it as best we can.</span></p>
<p>12.26 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a brief contribution, because I am conscious of the time.<br><br>
This has been a non-partisan debate, for the second week running. For those of us brought up on adversarial politics, that is a bewildering and strange experience. I was therefore grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet for introducing a note of division into the debate, although he may have introduced a division between those on the Government Benches, as opposed to one between those on the Government Benches and those on the Tory Benches.<br><br>
I accept my hon. Friend's argument that the technologies that we are dealing with create a beast that is difficult to control, but that does not mean that we should not attempt to introduce regulation. If we simply accept that the technologies are uncontrollable and there is nothing we can do, that leads to anarchy. The example that he cited—that because information that should not legally be available was now available on the internet, that was justification for it to be more widely available—is worrying. We heard that at Christmas in connection with the Home Secretary's son. We have also seen reference to the example of the opinion polls in the run-up to the French general election. We could have a debate about whether that law in that country was justified; none the less, that law exists. If we simply accept that, even though it exists, because the information is available on the internet it should be more widely available, we would see a regrettable undermining of confidence and belief in the applicability and functioning of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene, in accordance with the spirit of the debate, only to make the point that the situations to which the hon. Gentleman refers are legal in the country of origin. It is the fact that they are banned in other states that creates the difficulty. The possibility of ready electronic exchange of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
information—as opposed to the post, which might be seized by Customs or by someone else—creates the means. It is the coincidence of a legal jurisdiction, which we might want ourselves in some repsects, with another jurisdiction in which the material is banned, that causes the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an effective point, because it underlines the need to seek legitimate harmonisation of the law across the European Union as to which information is legally available and which is not. Clearly that should not involve reducing the law to the tightest definition and the strictest example, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet said. Unless there is harmonisation, the application of the law will increasingly be undermined, which would be regrettable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for inserting into what was turning into a love-in a note of extreme contention. I thoroughly disagree with him. Does he agree—I am sure that he does not, but I should be interested to hear why—that the harmonisation that he describes would be, as the hon. Member for South Thanet put it, holding on to the tail of the tiger? He might achieve complete harmonisation in the European Union by banning all materials of a certain kind—let us imagine the unimaginable—and find that they were readily available to everyone in the European Union by the simple flick of a switch and the searching of a web site in Guyana or Moldova.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a real danger of pessimism entering our discussions. Is the idea that we should simply accept that we are dealing with a situation wholly beyond our control? I am not sure that our constituents would accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have given way twice, and I have two other brief points to make. First, this is a crucial and hugely significant debate that is going completely unreported. The time of the national newspapers that constantly run xenophobic and anti-European campaigns about the perceived inadequacies of the EU would be better spent reporting some of our debates in this Committee. It would be wholly beneficial to open up the decision-making procedure within the EU.<br><br>
Finally, the Minister needs to keep focusing on the danger of the two-tier information society. Yes, we have been right to provide computers and the internet to schools, but I know from the experience of my children and their friends and from visits to schools in my constituency that there is a danger of a growing divide between chidlren who have access in their homes and those who do not. That is a real problem in terms of the educational development of those young people, and we need to focus on it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
<p>12.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a fascinating debate, which has illustrated the great importance of these scrutiny procedures. A number of important issues have been raised. I will not pretend that ready answers are always available. As has been pointed out, this is a developing situation, but I can assure the Committee that we will take the points that have been raised this morning very seriously, and that they will help us in our deliberations.<br><br>
As I made clear at the beginning, we welcome the Green Paper. I am grateful for the welcome that the hon. Member for Daventry and the rest of the Committee have given it. We regard it as a useful first step. The Commission is looking for responses by the end of April and we will submit our comments along the lines of the outline in the papers before the Committee today. As soon as possible after that, we will launch our own consultation on UK regulation, which will take the debate a stage further.<br><br>
Digital technology is clearly providing a common language for information and is driving convergence. We expect to see new digital services introduced in the UK later this year in cable, satellite and terrestrial media. The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about the implications for family cohesion, and about children going off to their bedrooms to use their PCs rather than gathering round the piano, the fireplace or the family television. But of course, digital technology means that television will be able to provide advanced on-line services, and that revolution may mean that the family can still gather in that way. The UK will be in an important position because we will be first to provide that delivery across all three platforms towards the end of the year.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised some important points about diversity. He also talked about the importance of IT skills and what they will mean. That was a common theme. My hon. Friend the Member for Harlow ended on that important point. The Government are mindful of the need to avoid divisions in society between information have and have-nots. We shall continue to work to that end. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe also raised that matter, which I think has met with general respect in the Committee. He referred to the role of the European Union in introducing measures to ensure that such divisions did not exist in European society.<br><br>
It is interesting that in some of my discussions with EU telecoms Ministers we have focused on national programmes to enhance take-up and use of the new services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister would agree that the practice of exchanging ideas—bilaterally and multilaterally—about good practice should be continuous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. My colleagues and I held a number of bilateral meetings with our ministerial colleagues in other member states as part of our preparations for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
United Kingdom presidency. We shared experiences and learned from each other and that process will continue when our presidency ends.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet—I hope that I have described him correctly, as I know how important that is—pointed out that such matters were incredibly difficult. We might think that we have all the answers and that we can put them in place tomorrow, but next week they will be different because the technology will have moved on.<br><br>
I said earlier that we all face the challenge of introducing the appropriate framework—I think that the hon. Member for Daventry used the same phrase. It should not be set in stone, but it should enable us to take account of any changes in future.<br><br>
I take issue with the hon. Member for South Thanet on one point. He envisaged that Members of Parliament would disappear and I felt a frisson go through the Committee. I realise that you, Mr. Atkinson, must remain neutral, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman's vision does not come to fruition.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for Stoke-on-Trent, South and for Luton, North referred to public service broadcasting and cross-media ownership. There must be a plurality of voice and we must ensure that the new technology brings greater choice and competition for quality broadcasting. However, we are entering a multi-channel environment which will bring challenges and difficulties.<br><br>
In the United Kingdom, we are rightly proud of our public service broadcasting. The Government believe that it has a continuing and important role, delivering programmes that are not editorially driven by commercial perspectives. The Government strongly believes that there must be a quality benchmark for broadcasting.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South also mentioned subsidiarity and I take his comments seriously. We must recognise what it is best for national Governments to do, and what it is best for the EU to do. It is also important at a global level. The Green Paper poses important questions about the way ahead.<br><br>
Regulation of the internet was discussed at length, and I appreciate many of the points that were made. As I said to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the laws that apply off-line should also apply on-line. The self-regulatory approach that we urge industry to take towards some matters should not exist in a vacuum, but should be based on the law of the land.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made an important point about the serious problem of child pornography and the need to tackle that. The hon. Member for Daventry said that we should use all available means to deal with the problem. I assure the Committee that we are doing that.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe also mentioned racist, criminal and terrorist material. It applies only to a small part of the internet, but we need to tackle the problem. I asked for a review of the Internet Watch Foundation's work to be conducted, and, as part of that, for my colleagues in the Home

Office and I to be able to consider widening the foundation's remit for dealing with racist material. At the next Telecoms Council in May, we hope to consider an internet action plan for dealing with some of the important issues that have been mentioned.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) asked important questions about the balance between deregulation and competition. They are intertwined, and it is important to achieve the right balance, which will take account of consumer interests and aid competitiveness. We must ensure that some of the newer entrants to the market can take advantage of that. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet said, some plans that we cannot currently imagine will come to fruition.<br><br>
We want to get the framework right, and to cope with the possible changes in the future. We cannot predict all those, but we want to avoid putting unecessary barriers in the way of new industries. I say to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
that I do not want to sound like Pollyanna, but I am optimistic that, if we get it right, we can drive the new industries, and take advantage of the welcome prospects that they offer.<br><br>
Our domestic thinking and our response to the Commission's Green Paper suggests an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary approach. I commend the motion to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 13289/97. a Commission Green Paper on the convergence of the telecommunications, media and information technology sectors, and the implications for regulation: <i>Towards an Information Society Approach;</i> shares the Commission's assessment of the importance of convergence to support the development of the information society; welcomes the Commission's recognition that the development of convergence provides substantial opportunities for job creation and growth; and notes that the Government intends shortly to launch a consultation on the future regulation of broadcasting and telecommunications in the United Kingdom.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at sixteen minutes to One o'clock.</i></p>
