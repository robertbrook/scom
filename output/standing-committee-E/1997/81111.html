	<time>Wednesday 11 November 1998</time>
	<p>[MR. ROGER GALE 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Agenda 2000: Financial Aspects</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>[	<i>Relevant documents: European Community Document No. 7138/98, Commission report on the functioning of the Loan Guarantee Fund and draft Council Regulation (EC, EURATOM) amending Regulation (EC, EURATOM) No. 2728/94.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Members of the Committee may remove their jackets for their greater comfort if they wish to do so. Before I call the Minister to make her opening statement, I should tell members of the Committee and others present about the arrangements for 11 o'clock. I propose to suspend the sitting as close as possible to 11 o'clock to enable those who wish to do so to observe two minutes' silence. At that time, I will interrupt whomever is on his feet, unless 11 o'clock conveniently strikes when somebody has just finished speaking. I will then invite members of the Committee who want to observe the silence to stand for the relevant two minutes. The sitting will resume two minutes after 11 o'clock. I hope that we shall be able to hear the chimes of Big Ben; otherwise, I will rely on the Annunciator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the chance to set our discussion in context. As hon. Members will be aware, Agenda 200 encompasses four rather challenging dossiers. First, there is the enlargement of the European Union to incorporate 10 states from eastern Europe plus Cyprus; secondly, there is reform of the common agricultural policy; thirdly, there is reform of the structural and cohesion funds; and, fourthly, there is a financial package for the next seven years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents before us set out the Commission's proposals for the fourth of those dossiers. There are four documents. The first two, which were published in March, concern the expenditure side of the account and deal respectively with budgetary procedures and spending ceilings. The third and fourth documents, which were published in September and October respectively, deal with the revenue side. The documents are closely interconnected, which is why the most effective approach to parliamentary scrutiny is to deal with all four together. There are also links with enlargement and policy reform. I will be happy to deal with those linkages, but I hope that hon. Members understand that I am a Treasury Minister and not an expert on agriculture, structural policy or enlargement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
The great issue that links all the aspects of Agenda 2000 is the level of European Community spending over the next seven years. At first sight, the Commission's proposals seem quite frugal—at least by the standards of its predecessors. It proposes to keep the own-resources ceiling at 1.27 per cent. of gross national product. Its proposed financial perspective ceiling on spending by the existing community—the existing 15 members—rises to 105 billion euros by 2006. Spending in the acceding states will, of course, come on top of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one looks further, however, one sees that the proposals are more expansionary and that the need for tight finance is more pressing. Actual spending is substantially less than the ceiling for 1999, and of course, all of this relates to commitments—the value of the new contracts that the Community can take out. The value of spending on existing contracts is much lower still—about 85 billion ecu for 1999. That is the figure with which we should compare the Commission's proposal of 105 billion euros for 2006. In other words, the proposal represents a 23 per cent. increase over the current level of payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Government's view, that is an inadequate response to the challenges that we face. In particular, it is essential that we ensure that there are sufficient resources in the budget to make successful and affordable enlargement possible. Furthermore, European approaches to public spending are now much more disciplined as a result of the stability pact criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need to spend all the money. The Commission proposes a further real increase in common agricultural policy spending, a 19 per cent. real increase in the structural and cohesion funds and large increases in other types of spending. I should stress that all of that money is for the current 15 member states. The costs of enlargement will come on top.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government therefore advocate that by 2006, the EC budget for the existing 15 member states should be stabilised at about the present level of spending. That will in turn produce a spending level of some 20 billion euros less than the ceiling proposed by the Commission. I am happy to say that our position is shared by several other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the level of spending has important effects throughout the dossier. I shall dwell briefly on its implications for contributions. Britain and the other member states are currently paying for about 85 billion ecu of spending. The cost of those contributions is causing public concern in a number of states, notably Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The further increases in spending—and therefor in contributions—proposed by the Commission are precisely the wrong response, not least because of the further additional contributions that will inevitably arise from enlargement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Relative to the Commission's proposals, the stabilisation of spending that I have described would save about 1 billion euros from Germany's net contribution by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
2006, and 250 million euros from that of the Netherlands. The Government understand the widespread concern in those countries about net contributions, because Britain has experienced the problem for such a long time. We seek to co-operate to ease the problem, so long as the United Kingdom's existing abatement, which remains well justified, is not undermined. We are, for instance, exploring with interest the Commission's idea of partial reimbursement of direct payments under the CAP, known more briefly as co-financing. Hon. Members will doubtless want to address that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that throughout the debate, hon. Members will recall that the Government are engaged in negotiation. For that reason, in the same way as my predecessor, I might sometimes have to choose my words with care and be a little less forthcoming about the Government's view than the Committee, and I, might like. I know that hon. Members will understand the need not to prejudice the Government's negotiation in this extremely important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Economic Secretary to the Treasury for setting out the background to the documents. She will be aware that a considerable proportion of the document about the financing of the European Union is devoted to the United Kingdom abatement and to the need for reform. The Prime Minister is on record as stating that he will maintain the UK budget rebate, and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury has repeated today that the Government believe that the rebate continues to be amply justified. Will she make it clear that the Government will not accept any change to the present formula for calculating of the rebate, and that they will veto any proposal to change it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to repeat the assurance that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister gave in the House last week. The Government will not accept any weakening or reduction of our abatement. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the Commission's report on own resources, which explicitly states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"even after the rebate the United Kingdom remains a larger net contributor to the EU budget than Member States with a higher capacity to pay".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Gale, to the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Committee questions the nitty-gritty of the documents, I should like to refer the Minister to paragraph 3.40 of the Court of Auditors special report 6/98, which is headed "The need for a measure of data quality". In the paragraphs under that heading, the Court of Auditors points out that unless the data on which we base our decisions are reliable and accurate, those decisions are not likely to be good. In those paragraphs, although it is stated that these statistics have been gathered—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This type of hybrid sitting always presents a problem. I remind members of the Committee that the first hour of the debate is devoted to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
questions to the Minister. Members should not, therefore, delve too deeply into the substance of what I recognise are very complex documents. That can be done in the hour and a half following questions. If the hon. Gentleman would be kind enough to put his question to the Minister, I am sure that she will try to answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just coming to that, Mr. Gale. Paragraph 3.40 states that the data are inaccurate as they have been gathered from different sources using different measures. Can my hon. Friend tell us whether the corrections that it is necessary to apply to the data have been applied so that they are accurate? If she cannot tell us that, can she give us an idea of when the data will be sufficiently accurate to allow decisions to be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may need to come back to my hon. Friend on that point. However, we share his concern about the quality of statistical data across the Community. The Office for National Statistics has been working closely with the statistical authorities of other member countries to improve the quality of data collection so that we have comparable statistics across the Community on which we can base this and other decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us the welcome news that the Government are committed to ensuring that the budget of existing members will remain at 85 billion ecu. Will she give us some idea of the scale of increase that she envisages will follow enlargement? Even more importantly, can she tell us more about her welcome commitment to the rebate as a veto item, and whether it is in absolute or proportional terms as regards the budget before and after enlargement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that there can be no confusion, let me underline the point that we will not accept any proposal that weakens or reduces the United Kingdom's abatement. The abatement will, we believe, continue to be fully justified even after enlargement. The numbers will, of course, change because of the application of the arithmetical formula, as indeed they change from year to year even now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there was an additional point to which the right hon. Gentleman wanted a reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister give us some idea of the range of figures that enlargement might involve?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most helpful figure that I can give is the own-resources ceiling—the upper limit set by the treaty. For the 15 members of the European Union, that currently represents a figure of 117.8 billion ecu. After enlargement to 21 states, it will represent 122.2 billion ecu.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult at this stage to give any precise figure for the costs of enlargement. We think that the Commission may have underestimated on its present figures, but at this stage broad-brush figures are all we have. The own resources ceiling at least gives us an idea of the upper limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the negotiating stance that the Minister has set out. In negotiations, will she push for agreement on Agenda 2000 before the end of the German presidency? My fear is that without such agreement, the momentum towards enlargement will run off the buffers, and it will be put off for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely share and welcome my hon. Friend's point about the need to maintain the momentum for Agenda 2000 and for policy reforms, particularly of the common agricultural policy. It is clear to us and to many other member states that we have to drive through the necessary policy reforms so we can deliver a stabilisation of spending by 2006. That will give us headroom for the enlargement of the Union, which we of course want to see. As hon. Members will know, the negotiations and screening process for the first six applicants commenced yesterday, and progress is already being made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely heartening to hear much of what the Minister says. There is a remarkable degree of consensus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may draw the hon. Lady's attention to footnote 22 on page 18 of the Commission's document on own resources. She will doubtless have noticed the reference there to a study conducted by the Commission into regional aid within member states. Have the Government asked why such a study has been conducted? Do they believe, as I do, that there is a danger that the Commission is simply putting forward proposals to approximate the EU's regional distribution figure to that which it has observed being used in some member states, namely, 4 per cent. of gross domestic product?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not aware of any such proposal, but a question of such detail on regional imbalances and, by implication, structural funds, is for my colleagues at the Department of Trade and Industry rather than the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may take my hon. Friend the Minister back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) about the accuracy of the statistical data. Will she confirm that, as well as trying to achieve some consistency between member states, the Government will address the continuing issue of fraud, which is raised again by the report? If such problems are not addressed, people will lose confidence in the statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government entirely share my hon. Friend's concern—as do many hon. Members—about fraud within the EU and, in particular, the recent serious allegations about fraud in the European Commission humanitarian office. My hon. Friend will understand that I do not want to comment in detail on a matter that is subject to criminal investigation. However, it is essential to tackle the problem, and we will continue to take and to support strong measures to eliminate fraud wherever it is found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the broader issue of data quality, we will continue to use the best available estimates in such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For its next financial framework the Commission assumes a figure of 2.5 per cent. growth for gross national product. How can we have any confidence in that? It appears to have been plucked from the air and is undoubtedly a median figure. Between July and November, our own Treasury had to downgrade its estimates of growth for this country by a percentage point; could not this figure also be wildly wrong, with extremely serious consequences for the budgetary perspective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's view about that estimate. There is a surprising degree of cross-party consensus this morning—long may it last. We believe that the figure is too high. However, the own resources ceiling is expressed as a percentage of GNP and is not dependent on its rate of growth. I emphasise that our proposal is expressed in terms of the current real value of payments by the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are committed to a clearer focus on poverty reduction in external expenditure. Does that policy meet with acceptance from the other member states? I know that there is a traditional emphasis on developing Mediterranean countries, which are not necessarily the poorest countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is fair to say that the Government—particularly my colleagues at the Department for International Development—are worried that the allocation of European Union aid to developing countries may not be as efficient and effective as it ought to be. I have recently been made aware of a World bank study on the allocation of aid that should assist us in arguing for a more effective and efficient allocation of humanitarian aid to emerging countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although conditions in European Union member states are not comparable to those in the poorest countries of the world, there are deep pockets of poverty and disadvantage in many member states, including the United Kingdom. It is important that the structural and cohesion funds in the European Union are used as effectively as possible to ensure that all people within the European Union can benefit from the opportunities that European Union membership is designed to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a firm defence of the UK rebate: that is welcome. She also said, however, that the Government understand the desire of the other major contributors to have a system that provides them with an equivalent form of abatement. Will the Minister explain how she envisages that such a system would operate? Would the United Kingdom rebate system continue to benefit the UK alongside a new system to help other member countries? Can the Minister see any way in which the other major contributors could benefit from the same system that applies to the UK? What would be the financial implications if such a system were to be established? How would the resulting shortfall in receipts be made up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As our fellow member states well understand, our position regarding the United Kingdom's abatement is clear. The abatement will not be weakened or reduced in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The arrangements that are to be made for other member states are primarily a matter for them rather than for us. However, I should point out that the Commission's outline scheme for a generalised rebate suggested that if other large net contributors were to be given an abatement on the same scale as that of the United Kingdom, the remaining member states would be required to contribute an additional 11 million ecu. The Commission rightly concluded that that would be unaffordable. The only other way in which every country could be given the same relief would be to reduce the United Kingdom's abatement, which would be unjust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission and other member states may wish to come forward with other options on redistribution: if so, we will look at them in due course. The best way to deal with the concerns that are emerging in other member countries about the level of their net contributions is to stabilise the budget in the way that we are proposing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister think that it is realistic to put a ceiling on structural funds and to expect member states to accept what is described in the documents as a fair reduction in their receipts while individual Members of Parliament—myself in particular—have made it clear that we are not prepared to accept a reduction in structural funds for our own areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position that my hon. Friend and other hon. Members adopt in relation to structural funds within their own regions must be a matter for their own judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If enlargement is to be affordable, we must see among current member states some reduction in their allocations after 1999. Without reform, the cost of the structural and cohesion fund could virtually double after all the applicant countries—the central and eastern European states, Cyprus and Malta—have joined. The reductions must be shared equitably among the existing 15 members. We could not accept any proposal that led to disproportionately large cuts in receipts to the United Kingdom in comparison with other, wealthier member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister offer an explanation of the data represented in graph 7 on page 21 of the report on own resources? It shows that the United Kingdom's budgetary imbalance doubled, both before and after compensation, in terms of percentage of GNP.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I have read table 3A in great detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to graph 7 on page 21.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah, I see. The formula for the United Kingdom abatement is highly complex and involves extremely technical and abstract definitions of contributions and receipts. The UK's net contribution varies considerably from year to year, partly as a result of exchange rate movements and partly because of compensation for underpayments—or, in some cases,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
overpayments—in the previous year. Those underpayments or overpayments often arise because of differences in the level and timing of our payments into the budget and our receipts from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the principal reason for the higher net contribution in 1998 is that we expect to make a substantial correction for an underpayment in the 1997 European Community budget. In contrast, in 1997 we qualified for a substantial recovery in respect of an overpayment in the previous year. Both corrections were due principally to exchange rate movements. Rather than looking at the figure in specific years, one should consider the abatement formula. Over time, its effect is to reduce considerably the imbalance and the net contributions that we would otherwise make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that size of the abatement is a result of our relatively low level of agricultural spending and the fact that we do not benefit much from the common agricultural policy? A fair arrangement would reflect gross national product and income from the European Union. The abatement need not be the only way to do that: would the Government consider another arrangement that was equally beneficial to the United Kingdom but which lacked some of the abatement's artificial effects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Utopia would be very nice, too. The low level of receipts to the United Kingdom is not a result only of spending on agriculture from the common agricultural policy. Per capita, we receive only about 55 per cent. of the average in the EU for spending on the CAP, but we receive only about 55 per cent. of the net per capita average in respect of other sources of receipts from the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, we should like European Union spending to be distributed more fairly, but that must be in the context of stabilising overall European Union spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a long time since I was a Member of the European Parliament, but I should be interested in the Minister's opinion of what quaintly used to be called the gentleman's agreement. I am sure that it is called something different in these politically correct days, but it always struck me as odd that institutions could not examine or influence each other's budgets. The European Parliament, for example, was keen on spending but had not responsibility for raising money. That must remain a crucial factor. Is the agreement still in effect and, if so, does the Minister believe that it should remain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. On that note, I intend to suspend the sitting to allow those hon. Members who so wish to rise and observe the two minutes' silence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
the Council and the European Parliament is dealt with under the treaty and the inter institutional agreement—an agreement that we believe helps to achieve a more sensible level of payments and commitments. A new inter institutional agreement is being sought in negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Court of Auditors report calls Britain's abatement an anomaly, but my hon. Friend the Minister says that the abatement is amply justified. Will she say more about the arguments that the Government intend to use in support of retaining our abatement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question. The central argument for our abatement is simple: depending on which per capita measure of GNP is used, we are the ninth, 10th or 11th most prosperous of the 15 Community countries. However, we are the fourth or fifth—again, depending on the measure used—largest contributor. In other words, our net contributions are significantly higher than those of more prosperous member countries which have a greater capacity to pay. That will remain so, even after enlargement, which is why, our abatement is amply justified, as the Commission's report recognises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Economic Secretary to the paragraph on building works on page 18 of the Commission's report on the establishment of a new financial perspective for 2000 to 2006. Many of the monstrously grand buildings for the Council and the Parliament have been completed, but what has happened to those for the European Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors? Is expenditure on the extension of the Court of Auditors, to house all the additional accountants who will be required, justified? Is the purpose of the extension in fact to house the many reports that have accumulated and gathered dust over the years, none of which seems to have had any effect on fraud and waste in the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that question; I shall investigate whether the European Court of Justice and other bodies of the European Union make full use of microfiche and other means of electronic storage. Tight control of administrative spending is a key part of our proposal for overall stabilisation of the budget. We in the Treasury scrutinise extremely carefully proposals for spending by other United Kingdom Government Departments. We also scrutinise—and seek the support of other member states in doing so—proposals for additional spending by the European Community. Expenditure on buildings is sometimes justified because over the longer term it will result in lower spending on, for example, rent. We judge carefully the value over time of such proposed investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of us who are true supporters of the European Union are often dismayed by spending on administration and management, in which regard I agree with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson). I press the Minister to do all that she can in the negotiations. Will the Government tackle not
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
only existing spending on administration and management, but the proposed growth in such spending, which is not acceptable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give my hon. Friend that assurance. We shall be equally tough in our scrutiny of existing and proposed European Community spending. I have no doubt that in plenty of examples spending is not justified, and, as I said earlier, we shall be able to secure the support of other member states for our general desire to stabilise spending at its current level by 2006.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Annexe 2 to "Financing the European Union: Commission Report on the Operation of the Own Resources System" lists several tax options for additional own resources, which, we are told, the Commission is not interested in pursuing at present. However, there is no doubt that they are on the Commission's agenda. Will the Government make clear that they will not accept a directly imposed tax from Brussels and that they will veto any such proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made very clear that fiscal policy is a matter for member states. Increasing the financial autonomy of European Union resources is not a desirable objective. Member states' finance and economic ministries—in this country, the Treasury—have a legitimate interest in what their taxpayers pay, and they must continue to exercise control. The alternative resources discussed in the Commission's report are unlikely to attract sufficient political support from member states to make them a serious item on the European agenda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Select Committee report states that the Commission proposes limited roll-over funds from year to year, of which the Government take a critical view. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor envisages greater use of roll-over because of the rather perverse effect of the world's coming to an end on 31 December every year. Will the Minister elaborate on the limited roll-over proposed, and on the Government criticisms of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Following the United Kingdom spending review, we have put in place a three-year planning horizon which will enable Departments to plan and fulfil expenditure much more effectively. As to the European Union, we are somewhat concerned about the rather extended period for which roll-over of spending for structural funds is permitted. We feel that a commitment entered into one year may not be paid for until many years later. That can produce inefficiencies in allocating resources in recipient member states, as well as genuine difficulties of peaks and troughs in member states' net contributions. We are attempting to put in place proper control mechanisms to ensure that structural funds are invested within a reasonable time of payments being committed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit, with increasing astonishment, that I agree with most of what the Minister has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come over here; sit on the Government Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not continue that line of debate, Mr. Gale, for fear of intruding on your patience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question to the Minister is a more general one. What does she consider is the purpose of structural funds in the first place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that structural funds are designed to achieve a regional policy in the EU as a whole, and to provide an investment capacity in physical, and to some extent social and human, infrastructure of regions which, for many historical reasons, fall well below the average standard of living and quality of life. Thus, in the long term, the funds will enable all parts of the EU to benefit from the growth that the single market, and broadly, the EU, makes possible, and reduce the risk of regions that are in many respects, less well resourced simply being left behind, as the benefits of growth are concentrated at the core. Structural funds are a most important part of long-term structural redistribution of the fruits of growth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 3.5.2 on page 17 of document 7046/98, which relates to administrative expenditure, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nearly half of this increase will be taken up by the expected sharp rise in expenditure on pensions which, on the basis of available forecasts and assuming no change in the arrangements, will require an additional EUR260 million".</p></blockquote>
That not only raises the specific issue of pensions, but touches on the much broader issue among EU institutions—the level of pay, remuneration and perks to which various EU officials have become accustomed. I should be interested to hear the Government's view on that generally—and, more specifically, on pensions. There have been articles in the press in the past few days about the European Parliament and its Members. I assume that the document reference that I gave is more specific to other institutions. However, it is worrying that we are being asked to approve at this stage a substantial budgetary increase for pensions, when the general view is that officials of the EU and its institutions are provided for generously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for making that point. There are indeed two issues. The first, which has been in the news recently, relates to the discovery that some Members of the European Parliament may have used European Community funds inappropriately for their own additional voluntary contributions. I am glad to say that one Labour Member of the European Parliament has already proposed an appropriate initiative to ensure that that practice ends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has just reported on the issue of staff pensions, to which the report refers. That is an extremely serious issue, and we will be pressing for the support of other member states for a review of staffing regulations and terms and conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much of the budget before us is based on the assumption that certain policy reforms will be made involving the CAP and the structural funds. The budget is dependent on a whole raft of interlinking measures. What progress is being made on those reforms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer specifically to the common agricultural policy, which is a major item for policy reform? As the Committee will know, the Commission has made several proposals for CAP reform. We do not believe that those proposals go far enough; we have a particular concern about reform for milk and dairy products. However, if they were accepted as they stand, they would represent a real benefit for United Kingdom consumers—a cut in prices amounting to about £1 billion a year, which would be a significant value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the Commission's current proposals would not produce an appropriate or adequate benefit for European Union taxpayers. It is proposed that the compensation to farmers that would follow from market reforms and price reductions be made permanent, instead of being reduced over time, as we would wish. However, the fundamental point is that reform of the common agricultural policy and the changes that we want to be made to the structural funds—the large policy reforms—are the subject of difficult and tough negotiations, in which each member state will have its own especial interests and perspectives to defend. Major agreements will not be reached until the end game of those negotiations. I however assure my hon. Friend and the Committee that the United Kingdom will continue to press extremely hard for the policy reform that is essential to achieve the stabilisation objective, and thus, in turn, to allow budgetary room for successful enlargement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for missing the earlier part of questions, Mr. Gale. I should like to follow up one of the Minister's answers, in which she acknowledged the difficulties in comparing British living standards with those of other European countries. First, will she comment on what appear to be the main set of figures used by the European Union, which are in annexe 8—GNP converted into ecus? They suggest that, this year and next year, Britain's living standards will be well above the European average—approximately 6 per cent. above the average. For the first time in living memory, we have a standard of living roughly comparable to that of France or Holland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as there is obviously enormous room for argument and debate about what is the correct conversion rate, what does the Treasury consider to be the appropriate exchange rate for converting British national income or living standards into European equivalents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just as we were, in 1984, the 10th most prosperous state on a per capita comparison of the 15 states that are now in the European Union, so, in 1997, we were the ninth or 10th most prosperous state. Of course there has been change at the margins, but we do not accept any suggestion that we have caught up. As for exchange rate calculations, whether one uses PPP—purchasing power parity—or market exchange rates, the relative position will be unchanged. I stress to the hon. Gentleman that it is not the average that matters. We are poor on a per capita basis—poorer than other member states that contribute less. Contrary to his rather optimistic view, our per capita standard of living is lower than that of France.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Geraldine Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morecambe and Lunesdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that increased spending on the transEuropean networks is important, given that it leads to a growth in prosperity and job opportunities? I ask that question for a selfish reason—because my constituency has been trying to attract funding as part of the transEuropean network. The port in my area is cut off completely, and, like many other places within the European Community, we do not have decent transport links. Can my hon. Friend give me an idea of what will happen in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's concern for her constituency and region. I agree about the real value of physical networks, such as roads, railways and telecommunications infrastructure, and the contribution that they can make to ensuring that the opportunities opened up by a single market throughout the European Union reach all parts of the Community. The Government welcome the progress that has been made in implementing transEuropean networks. The main obstacle to that progress has not been a lack of finance, but technical, administrative and legal problems in many other member states—although I accept that those are not the trouble in my hon. Friend's constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European budget that is available to help drive through the 10 projects covers no more than 10 per cent. of the cost of any individual project. We shall consider the benefits of extra spending on the networks against the need to restrain spending in all parts of the Community budget to achieve our overall strategic objective of stabilisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her response to my earlier question, the Minister said that there was not much political support in member states for the various options for direct taxation listed in annexe 2 of the Commission document. however, one of those options, which seems to have considerable political support throughout the Community, is the imposition of a 20 per cent. withholding tax. Will the Minister make it clear that the Government will not accept such a proposal? Does she accept that if such a tax were to be imposed, it would cause irreparable damage to the City of London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made clear in the House last week, we will not accept a proposal that would damage the position of the City of London, especially in respect of the Eurobonds market. We believe that damage to the City of London would be harmful not only for this country, but for the European Union as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I bring the Minister back to structural funds? On many occasions the Committee has shown widespread supprot for the concept of EU enlargement. Does my hon. Friend agree that to achieve that, we need either a redistribution—albeit a modest one—of the structural funds, or a significant increase in the EU budget? One of those steps must be taken; Opposition Members cannot ignore that fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stress the need to stick to our strategic objective of stabilising the budget by 2006 at the present level of payments. That will mean reductions over time in
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
the structural funds received by the present member states to allow headroom for enlargement. It seems curious that member states that envisage joining economic and monetary union should none the less see a need for receiving structural and cohesion funds. We do not think that those two positions are compatible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Minister and the Treasury team ever question the methodology of European Union financing? Are not the quinquennial perspectives simply the result of expectations that may not be realised? There is talk of 2.5 per cent. growth for existing members of the European Union, and 4.4 per cent. growth is predicated for the accession states. If the European Union were to move to annuality of supply—a traditional parliamentary practice—might not it be a much more efficient method of controlling expenditure, ensuring that budgetary programmes can genuinely be afforded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All of us involved in European Union negotiations occasionally question the complexity and opacity of what we have to deal with. Our immediate objective, however, is to achieve agreement on the next financial perspective. Perspectives have prevented the huge battles over spending that used to happen every year, and they have produced much better budget discipline within the European Community. We can see that, because of the margin that now exists between the level of payments and the own-resources ceiling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now want to rebase the negotiations around the next seven-year financial perspective. We want it to start from the present level of payments, rather than taking the existing ceiling as its departure point. Our priority is not to try to unpick the entire basis of the negotiations but to get a satisfactory deal—one that will give us budget discipline and the necessary stabilisation by March 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In an earlier question, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) pointed out that many people are upset by the perceived perks in the European Union. Does my hon. Friend agree that if those same people heard the right hon. Gentleman speak, they would probably point out the amount of glass to be found in the Palace of Westminster?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that suggestion. I wonder whether I should draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention to Lord Marshall's report, which mentions a possible energy tax on business and the need for better environmental use of resources, which is a matter of great concern to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to an earlier question, when she was invited to comment on new sources of taxation? In her anxiety to reassure those on the Conservative Front Bench that there would not be any new taxes, she may have overlooked some of the possibilities. May I refresh the hon. Lady's memory? The Commission's paper lists six—a withholding tax, an energy tax, excise duties, seignorage, corporate and personal income tax, and new communications taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a long list, so I shall ask the Economic Secretary to comment on only one. Seignorage is the revenue from the creation of new money—in this case, the euro. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
seems an appropriate source of revenue for the European Union, given that it is European money. Why have the Government excluded it as a possible source of revenue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly consider that in more detail. However, as the United Kingdom will not be joining the single currency on 1 January, it is not a matter of immediate concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary made a most revealing statement when she said that she did not regard it as compatible for a country both to receive structural fund money and to join economic and monetary union. Has she had the opportunity to read the 	<i>Hansard</i> reports of some of the Committee's previous sittings last year and earlier this year? We have had long debates about the Commission's requirement under Agenda 2000 that acceding member states in the enlarged Union should have to participate in stages 1 and 2 of European monetary union. Does the Minister think that that is incompatible with the receipt of structural funds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about membership of stage 3 of European monetary union. Perhaps I did not make that clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a general but important point about the budget that should be on the record. Can the Minister assure us that while negotiations are in progress, as they are so important to every citizen in the country, she will do her best to ensure that as much information as possible is given to the public so that they are aware of what is going on and can contribute to the debate, through their Members of Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I happily give my hon. Friend that assurance. The more that we can encourage and assist public understanding of and debate on European matters, the more likely we are to achieve our objective of a people's Europe in which people feel engaged and from which they can see the benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

harmony. In that spirit, I would first like to thank the Economic Secretary to the Treasury for ensuring that members of the Committee received all the relevant papers. There have been problems in that respect in the past, as members of the Committee know, but so keen was the Treasury to ensure that those problems did not occur on this occasion, that in order to hand me the pack of papers for the debate in person, one of the hon. Lady's officials accosted me in the street. I am grateful for the efforts made to ensure that there were no problems this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must express my admiration for the Economic Secretary. At 11.30 last night we listened to the hon. Lady valiantly attempting to defend the shambles of the introduction of individual savings accounts. This morning she is debating the European budget; at lunchtime, I understand, she will be debating taxation of the road haulage industry, and at 4.30 this afternoon she will debate an order on insurance contracting-out functions, and will have faced three different shadow Treasury Front-Bench spokesmen. She may well feel that she should have stayed on the Back Benches. I do not know what has happened to the other Treasury Ministers; they appear to have gone on holiday. Clearly the hon. lady has drawn the short straw. We all found it hard enough to master the enormous volume of documentation in time for this debate; to have to master documents on four different subjects in 24 hours is quite a feat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is remarkable agreement on both sides of the Committee about the documents. The Opposition recognise the need for a new financial framework, especially as we entirely support the wish for enlargement of the Community. If enlargement is to be achieved, it is essential that we draw up a new framework for financing the Community to ensure that funds are available to meet the needs of new member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's note of caution about some of the proposals and their intention to resist them. We welcome the robustness of the language used by the Economic Secretary in the debate, and we have faith that that same robustness will be displayed in the forthcoming negotiations in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall focus on several specific points arising from our debate, the first of which relates to expenditure. As the Economic Secretary said, the Commission's proposals allow the ceiling for payments to rise from 83 billion euros to 106 billion euros by 2006, an increase of 23 per cent. The Government have said that that figure is too high, and have announced that they intend to stabilise the budget at the present level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Economic Secretary will say more about that; in particular, I understand from her opening remarks that about £20 billion less spending will be required over the next seven years. Does the hon. Lady see that sum coming entirely from reform of the common agricultural policy or from somewhere else? Where else does she envisage that savings could be made in the Commission's existing proposals? What support has she had on the proposal from other member states?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, in the past, we found that the only member states that were prepared to support greater budgetary rigour were those which had to pay the bill. Admittedly,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
there are few more of those than there were 10 years ago. Nevertheless, I imagine that there will be considerable resistance among many member states to any limitation on the budget. Without wishing the Economic Secretary to give away too much of her negotiating position, can she tell us what support she has received and how optimistic she is that the target can be achieved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) raised the important question of the assumption of a 2.5 per cent. growth rate, which the Commission has adopted. Exactly that growth rate was assumed in a previous document produced by the Commission about a year before. As my hon. Friend said, there has been a considerable downward revision of growth rates across the world, but that seems to have escaped the notice of the Commission. Can the Economic Secretary say a little more about the consequences if that growth rate is not met?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that her intention is that overall spending should be comfortably below the Commission's proposed ceiling. If the assumed growth rate is not met, there could be considerable implications for the safety margin that is intended to exist between overall spending and the ceiling for spending. We are told that that safety margin is essential if enlargement is to go ahead. If the growth rate is less than that forecast by the Commission, what would be the consequence on the safety margin and would that jeopardise the possibility of proceeding with enlargement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to focus on agricultural spending. Despite all the avowed intentions to reform the CAP, the ceiling on heading 1 is set to increase by 14 per cent. in real terms. That is an indication of the failure to achieve any meaningful reform of the CAP. It is predicted that there is likely to be a significant margin beneath that ceiling—ranging from 3 billion euros in the years 2001 to 2003, to 9.7 billion euros in 2006. The Commission defends the size of that margin on the basis of possible uncertainties in the agricultural market, but to increase the ceiling to that extent will send entirely the wrong signals. Does the Economic Secretary believe that there is scope to reduce that ceiling to bring it closer to intended spending?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always been the Government's intention that there should be serious reform of the CAP. In his document "New Britain", the Prime Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We need to make a serious effort to reform the CAP without which enlargement cannot happen."</p></blockquote>
He was entirely right to say that. There is a real danger that enlargement might be delayed because of the failure to achieve serious reform of the CAP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Economic Secretary reflect on the other pressures on the budget that have not been fully taken into account in the documents? What effect does she believe the introduction of the single currency is likely to have? In particular, does she accept the view of many economists that the imposition of a single interest rate on the 11 countries that will become members of the single currency from 1 January might lead to a reduced growth rate in some of those countries and to greater pressure for payments to compensate those that might experience increased unemployment as a result of their being no longer able to adjust their economies through movements in their exchange rates?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
In addition, the Government have declared ambitions for the introduction of a common European Union foreign policy and a combined defence policy. That was certainly not the Government's declared intention a year ago. However, we are told that the Prime Minister has changed his view and now sees merit in that proposal. The consequence of that will inevitably be more spending. How do the Government square their support for the wider aims of the European Union while arguing for greater restraint on spending?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to say a little more about the United Kingdom's own contribution to the budget—a subject that has occupied the attention of a number of hon. Members this morning. I very much welcome the robust words of the Economic Secretary in defence of the UK rebate, but there is no doubt that the Government will come under considerable pressure. Both the Commission and the Court of Auditors made it clear that they oppose the continuation of the budget. The four other large net contributors—Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden—have made it clear that if Britain continues to have a rebate, they want one too. Only this month, the Dutch Finance Minister, Mr. Zalm said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am taking the opportunity to tell him"—</p></blockquote>
the Chancellor of the Exchequer—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it is about time this system of British compensation was finished."</p></blockquote>
There is little doubt that the UK will come under great pressure on the rebate. Although I welcome the robust declaration of the Economic Secretary, I am still a little puzzled as to how precisely we can maintain a unique system that benefits this country, while, at the same time, do something to help those other countries which are now complaining that they, too, are disadvantaged by the present system—a concern with which the Government say they have sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Economic Secretary that the real answer is fundamentally to reform the European budget and to get it down to the levels that the Government now propose. I believe that that is being optimistic as it may not satisfy the demands of the four contributors who are now demanding a system of their own. I hope that the Government will continue to adopt a robust attitude to the matter, but I should be grateful if the Minister would say a little more about how she proposes to address those countries' concerns, which she says she recognises, when she comes to the negotiations that lie ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Economic Secretary has said, enlargement will put more pressures on the budget. The figures that we have been debating do not take account of the likely increases that will result from enlargement by the admission of the six applicant countries. It is understandable that the four countries seeking a change to the rebate arrangements are likely to want a mechanism to be in place before enlargement occurs. There is likely to be an almighty row at the next meeting when these matters are debated. As I said, we welcome the robust nature of the Minister's remarks, but I hope that she will reassure us that she will not be swayed by a desire to be a good European. If, on this matter, Britain is isolated in the Community and is forced to veto proposals for change, I hope that the Government will not hesitate to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Even with the continuation of the rebate, we understand that the net contributions are still set to rise. Under the Commission's proposals, it is said that their consequence will be that the net contribution from this country is likely to reach 4.1 billion by 2006, not accounting for inflation. That represents a payment of more than £11 million every day, before the full costs of enlargement are taken into account. The tensions caused by the growing pressures on the budget, in addition to the strain put on contributor countries and the irritation caused by what some see as special treatment for Britain, cannot continue in the long term. While I welcome the Economic Secretary's defence of the UK rebate, does she agree that it is a sticking plaster on a creaking system that is untenable in the long term? Is not it time for a fundamental re-examination of the whole European Union budget and a fresh consideration of what it should finance? That cannot be avoided indefinitely. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary could perhaps say a little more about it when she responds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to comment on the funding of the budget and some of the suggestions that I have touched on, and which the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) set out in his question, for a fifth resource.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission, in its document, has not been reticent in proposing options for new European-based taxes. The ostensible reason is the need to meet the cost of enlargement and the future cost to the European Union budget. However, we should not be under any illusion—it is part of an agenda for the creation of economic union and tax harmonisation across the Community. The Commission has made no secret of the fact that it wants to move from a budget financed by contributions from member states to one directly financed by taxation imposed by the European Union. Doing so would significantly erode the powers of member states over taxation. The Minister has said that the Government intend to resist moves in that direction, and I welcome that news. Indeed, the Financial Secretary said at Question Time last week:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have made it absolutely clear that we intend to maintain for this House decisions on taxation." [	<i>Official Report,</i> 5 November 1998; Vol. 318, c. 1000.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will confirm that that is the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say a word about one or two of the individual options proposed by the European Union, such as having a common system of VAT? That has been on the agenda for some considerable time. It is argued by some that a single market cannot be achieved without harmonising VAT. Will the Government make it clear that they will not accept moves towards harmonisation and the imposition of a low rate by the Commission to apply in all member states?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady will be aware of the importance attached by the Austrians and their presidency towards the harmonisation of corporation tax. That is being pursued actively by the Commission and a number of member states. Will the hon. Lady say a word about the Government's attitude to the harmonisation of company taxation, and make it clear that that will also be resisted by the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
The hon. Lady will also be aware that at a recent meeting in Austria, the president of the European Parliament said that we should create an own resource for the Union in the form of a direct income tax. We are told that such a proposal is supported by Portugal, Spain and Greece. Will she make it clear that the Government will veto such a proposal if it is put on the table?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to mention once again the withholding tax. Although the Economic Secretary's comments that she will not accept any taxation that will damage the interests of the City are welcome, there is nevertheless a strong and determined move to impose such a tax. Commissioner Monti has made it clear that he regards it as a priority. Both the Austrian and the German presidencies have put it at the top of their agenda. The recent Dale report spelt out the dangers of imposing such a tax. It illustrated its effect by showing what happened when a similar tax was imposed in the United States, which was what led to the creation of the Eurobond market in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubting the importance of this matter. I hope that the Economic Secretary will make it clear that she will not accept the proposal on the table for a 20 per cent. withholding tax, and that she will not accept any fudge or compromise on the matter, but will make it clear to our European Union partners that the matter is non-negotiable and that we will not accept any such taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the European Union is entering a period in which there will be difficult negotiations. Opposition Members strongly welcome the tough words of the Economic Secretary in this debate, but they will need to be matched by tough actions. We will have to be isolated if necessary, and must not be afraid to risk unpopularity. The original British rebate was achieved only by the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, saying, "No, no, no." I hope that the Economic Secretary will assure us that she is equally prepared to say "No, no, no" even if it is at the price of continuing to be seen as good Europeans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.50 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to return to the subject of utopia. Most people would agree in principle that the system operating the British rebate and the rebates now being sought by other countries is slightly artificial. It is essential because of the way in which overall system works. I wish to avoid any misunderstanding. I am not suggesting a new arrangement that would have adverse effects on Britain in comparison with the current arrangement. I wonder, however, whether a system without perverse side effects could be achieved? The current operation of the rebate means that, whenever Britain stands to gain from specific European Union spending, it is somewhat inhibited by the knowledge that a substantial part of that gain will disappear in a reduction of the rebate. In the same way, when an opportunity to reduce Britain' s contribution arises, we are not motivated to the same extent as other member states because the reduction will simply lead to a diminution in the rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way in which we can tackle the problem is to move away from the concept that, at any moment, the proportion of Britain's GNP spent on the European Union
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
should be close to the proportion that we get out of it. Rather than taking contributions from individual sources, such as VAT, we should consider setting a national contribution rate based on the GNP and on income from the Community at a specific time. That rate could be fixed for, let us say, 20 years, during which Britain would be able to benefit fully from European spending without the money being clawed back through a reduced rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To avoid long-term imbalances, the share of contributions would have to be reconsidered from time to time—I would suggest a period of about 20 years—in the same way as standard spending assessments given to councils are reviewed. We would check periodically that no country in the European Union was grossly disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the starting point of the new approach was that contributions should roughly match net spending and net income from the European Union, Britain would be better off than it is today. As the Economic Secretary said, even with the rebate we are currently somewhat disadvantaged. The wish of many European Union countries to achieve a cleaner system that takes account of other countries' problems as well as their own might make them willing to consider a change that, in the short term at least, would benefit Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As any advantage to Britain is a zero sum gain, it will disadvantage another country and, obviously, that makes the matter extremely difficult. I understand that the motivation of some European Union countries to achieve a more sensible system can make them more willing to pay a price for it as part of a fairer distribution of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that such a change is, as the Economic Secretary suggested, too utopian to consider. I am offering a negotiating position, and an alternative to saying that we have got our rebates and that we will not discuss any change whatsoever. We could say that we want to make a fair proportion of contributions, reflecting the resources that we get from the European Union, and that we are open to discussion on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Our purpose is, therefore, above all, to assist the Minister in attaining a clear view of the matters involved and to give her some sense of how hon. Members on both sides of the House feel about them so that she at least has that in the back of her mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There might occasionally be even more dramatic consequences. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) might not recall that in the previous Parliament our right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) saw the light. His damascene conversion led him away from the pursuit of a single currency towards the holy grail of restored national independence in monetary management. That process occurred steadily over time in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As so often, my hon. Friend leads me to the very points that I wanted to make. The Economic Secretary seems to have seen so much light during the Committee's meeting that one is positively dazzled. As I reflect on her various remarks and on those of other members of the Committee, it occurs to me that we are experiencing the same old problem, although in a new way. My first point relates to the nature of the balance between payment and receipt; my second relates to one's view of the use of expenditure. Both points relate to the structural funds and to the documents before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the Committee's discussion has been about the in-out balance by nation. Should the United Kingdom, roughly speaking, get the same amount out as it puts in? Some of the discussion has been about a different conception of balance, and the Economic Secretary came close to it at one point at least. In that conception, balance is achieved when there are fair contributions by nation—that is to say, when there is a net contribution in or a net receipt out. That will depend on relative GDP, whether measured by purchasing power parity or the gross figures. There is a third conception, which the Commission has persistently entertained and which is abundantly revealed in the telltale footnote 22, to which I animadverted earlier. That conception relates to regional imbalance and has nothing to do with member states. It would suggest vastly greater contributions and receipts to achieve an evening by region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem. The Economic Secretary disavowed the in-out balance by nation. She did not maintain that each country should put in exactly what it gets out; she was more in the camp of those who seek a fair contribution relative to GDP. When I asked what the structural funds were for, however, she launched—as one does, almost inevitably, when one thinks of structural funds as opposed to cohesion funds—into a discussion of uneven development, which is essentially a regional phenomenon and not a national one. In fact, the south-east of England is one of the most over-developed regions of the EU, while the north-west and the south-west are, by some measures, among the least developed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What proposals does the hon. Gentleman have to curb the over-development of the south-east of England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no proposals to curb its over-development, only to encourage it—except with regard to housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will begin to discern in the Economic Secretary's mind a conflict between two views which it is difficult to resolve: whether structural funds ought to be aimed at evening out development between regions, or whether they ought to be so constructed that, as between countries and their relative GDPs, there should be a fair contribution and receipt. Those two might match, but they are asystemically related—there is no reason why they should match. However, the situation is much worse. What is the real use of the funds in question?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note in passing, that I do not believe in the thesis of evening out development. I do not think that state-administered subsidies have any econometric record of having evened out development anywhere in the world; on the whole, they have done the reverse. However, let us accept for a moment that evening development could occur by the administration of subsidies from far afield. An attempt to create structural evening, as the Minister described, would be a kind of radiotherapy—that is, a treatment whereby the intention is to cure the patient. The place in receipt of the money would come up to a certain level, it would then be capable of meeting other parts of the Union on fair competitive terms and, hey presto, economic development as a whole in the Union would increase because of the trade effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cohesion funds are a kind of aspirin. They are not meant to cure anyone, but they will make the patient feel a little better when suffering from a heavy cold or worse as a result of the action of external forces. Here we come face to face with the deep incoherence of the Minister's position, although I do not accuse her of adopting it alone—it is a position shared by the greater part of the British establishment, including, I regret to say, the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The incoherence can best be seen in the Minister's response to my question about EMU and the accession of new members. If she is right—as I think she is—that it is incoherent for a member state to seek to enter EMU and then to argue that it needs radiotherapy in the form of sustained structural subsidy, it must also be incoherent for a member state to enter stage 2 of EMU, which is locked exchange rates, and seek that kind of radiotherapy. But that is precisely the proposal contained in the Commission's Agenda 2000, which the Government, regrettably—despite prodding by myself and other members of the Committee—have not taken up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If some member states are to be locked in to long-term fixed exchange rates and we are to try to administer massive structural aid to them to bring them or their regions up to the level of the average of the whole, the expenditure involved will tear apart the Minister's brave assertions about control of structural funding. There is no doubt in my mind that the amount that will have to be spent on the aspirins to keep countries alive—or without severe headaches—when their economies are suffering from locked exchange rates will be very large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take Poland, for example. Over the years, its failure to be allowed to devalue will lead not to structural problems, but to severe social problems which will require much
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
funding. Yet that is what the Commission is arguing for, implicitly, when it says that countries must enter stage 2 before they can enter the Union. That will not be compatible with control of the total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, beyond that, the Minister is arguing that we ought to be administering radiotherapy to get the whole Polish economy up to the level of the average, even if one is an optimist, the allowances in the document are wholly derisory. That brings us back to the question about the limits. The Minister appeared to maintain that the only limit is fair contribution. If so, we could invent a mechanism such as was described by the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), or persist with the current rebate mechanism, or do whatever we like but, because for many years the UK will remain enormously richer than the acceding countries, the effect will be merely to ensure that the UK pays its fair contribution, in relative terms, to the vastly larger amount of money that will have to be raised and spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My pessimistic view is that the administration of the structural funds—given fixed exchange rates and a single interest rate regime—will never bring those acceding countries up to the level of the UK. If that were ever to happen, it would be the result of underlying microeconomic factors, not subsidies. Therefore, although it may be fair in terms of relative gross domestic product, we may be facing 20, 30, 40 or 50 years in which the UK will be paying vastly more money than at present into structural funds vastly bigger than what the Minister has described. Those funds will be used to administer the aspirin to keep acceding countries socially happy under fixed exchange rates, and to attempt to bring about what I consider to be the illusory goal of raising them, structurally, to the level of the whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not faced up to that problem. That is not a personal criticism, as neither the Government, the political establishment nor all Conservative Members, even in our current enlightened form, have faced up to it fully. The hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell), who never fails to make a political point when he can, accused us of talking rhetorically about our fervour for enlargement but of not facing up tot he cost. In part, he was right. The settled opinion among Conservative Members—and I suspect it is shared by many Labour Members—is that the level of the budget and the structural funds should be retained at roughly present levels. However, if, like me, one believes in enlargement, two further steps must be taken. First, the idea that acceding countries should join EMU stage 2 should be abandoned and, secondly, we must break down the idea that structural funds will ever be able to do the task described by the Minister. Those funds will not be able to give much in the way of aspirin, let alone administer serious doses of radiotherapy—that would simply be much too expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I hope that this debate will help to clarify opinions among Conservative Members, above all I hope that the Minister will try to work out, with her colleagues, where the Government stand on the matter. Do the Government want EMU stage 2 to be a rule of enlargement? That would involve a vast increase in structural funds, and hence a great increase in Britain's contribution—even though that will be fair in GDP terms,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
or do they want to resist that tendency and therefore limit the amount of funding that the UK puts into the whole machine?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those questions are material to the points made from the Front Bench by my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale). If it is intended that the acceding countries will join EMU stage 2 that there will be a fixed exchange rate and that there will be funds available for radiotherapy, it will not be possible, in political terms, to raise the sums involved from the current base of resources. The Commission knows that and that is why it is urgently trying to find ways to raise resources from new sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So an intimate logical link exists, and it is always dangerous to underestimate the Commission. Its members are highly intelligent and have seen the logic that I have described. However, their attitude to the outcome is very different from mine, as they would prefer to widen the tax base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debates in the past few sittings of this Committee have been very interesting. Although hon. Members differ in their views on Europe, points such as those raised by the hon. Member for West Dorset help Ministers to understand what Members of Parliament feel about the negotiations in which the Government are involved. This Committee therefore has a crucial role to play in the scrutiny of legislation and in ensuring that Ministers are fully informed. This morning's debate is important in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to speak in general terms about the context in which the budget negotiations are taking place and the policy reforms that are referred to in the papers under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Europe stands on the threshold of grand and visionary developments. The enlargement of Europe presents a huge opportunity for existing members. That is true in terms not only of economic growth and new markets for our businesses. I take the point made earlier about speculation regarding the future level of economic growth, and I agree that 2.5 per cent. may be unrealistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to economic growth, enlargement offers opportunities for the extension of human rights and the development of democracy. Those are ideals on which we as a nation have always prided ourselves in terms of setting an example and trying to encourage their development in other parts of the world, including Europe. It is particularly pertinent, on this day on which we remember those who fell in the past, to discuss how we can extend human rights and the democratic ideal to other parts of Europe. That process presents enormous problems in terms of the budget for existing members and the budget that will need to be developed to take prospective members into account. However, problems can be overcome through negotiation—they should not be seen as difficulties that prevent us from moving forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Union budget is regarded by many members of the public with concern and even with cynicism, and the Minister should reassure them that their worries are being addressed. Huge sums of money are involved, and people are concerned about the continuing
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
levels of fraud that are referred to in the papers before us. Any sensible person will realise that to describe VAT as a self-policing tax is nonsensical. My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet pointed out the statistical anomalies that occur: for example, there is no consistency between countries in the way in which GNP is measured. Such matters impinge upon people's perception of how well, or otherwise, the EU is working and of how well the money that they are contributing through their taxes is being used to meet the ideals that I spoke of in my opening remarks. Many people feel that the growing costs of administration are excessive and that that money is being wasted instead of being well-used in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consistency of statistics and the costs of administration, management and fraud are crucial issues. The Government should be seen to be doing something about them. Whenever the budget has been discussed in Committee, we have said that the level of fraud is too high. We need something that works, so that we can see the level of fraud reducing rather than continually increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish my hon. Friend the Minister well in her efforts because difficulties will arise if the CAP is not reformed; I know that there are moves to change the way in which support is given. The Minister said that she is no expert on agriculture—neither am I, but I know that if the CAP, which already takes huge sums out of the budget, is not reformed, problems will occur when the eastern Europe economies are added under enlargement. Changes to the structural funds are also needed. It is difficult to see how the Government can succeed in some of their policy objectives without such reforms to the CAP, structural funds and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing the budget, it is important also to talk about the opportunity that exists to build a wider and bigger Europe, not only for us but for the people of the member states as a whole. By working together, we can solve some of our common problems. However, we must also tackle the important issues of fraud, administration and management costs, which seem to rise inexorably, and the consistency of statistics among member states. We can all take heart from the responses of my hon. Friend the Minister. While it is easy to throw things backwards and forwards in debate, it is important to achieve a consensus and for the points made this morning to be taken forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.17 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on the speed with which she has adapted to a complicated and demanding job. I have begun to get a feel for such complexity myself, having gone from discussing individual savings accounts last night to Europe this morning, via a speech on domestic violence at 9 am—which is why I was late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central problem is the fact that our approach to European Union funding is dominated by the issue of the British rebate. I understand why that is so; Mrs. Thatcher's strong, machismo stance in the 1980s of "No, no, no," achieved a result and it is understandable that the Government do not wish to be roasted by 	<i>The Sun</i>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
for showing weakness. However, the more one reflects on the matter, the more ridiculous it seems; we are arguing about a fraction of a relatively small sum—less than 1 per cent. of the total British public expenditure. I agree with the hon. member for Maldon and East Chelmsford that the British position is ultimately unsustainable, especially in terms of the figures given in the tables.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by the hon. Gentleman's opening remarks because, although the sums in question may to him seem small and statistically insignificant, to his voters in Twickenham and to mine in Ruislip-Northwood—and doubtless to those in the constituencies of all other members of the Committee—they are surely enormous sums which could bring immeasurable benefits if they were used on local projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Prudence in the management of European funding is of course vital and I do not wish to imply a lack of concern about that. However, the specific issue of the intricacies of the European budget has never been raised in the 30 or so letters that I receive every day from various people, mostly constituents—although many are concerned about the general issue of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British position is unsustainable in the long term. The Commission's figures on the convergence of European living standards, which the Minister confirmed, suggest that they are above the mean—at least measured in the two main ways used by the Commission. The Minister is right to point out that our per capita income in ecu terms is still slightly below that of France—an interesting example. However, she did not point out that for most of the past two decades, the differential has been up to 20 per cent. and that it is now down to about 1 per cent. It is important to remember that our income per capita is now above average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister takes refuge in the fact that, although that may be true, a relatively large number of countries are above us in the pecking order. In technical terms, she is saying that we are below the median but above the mean, which does not generate much indignation when perpetuating the argument, although it may be statistically correct. In any event, even that differential is being eroded. As she knows, some countries that are above us—notably the Dutch—feel a strong sense of indignation that they pay disproportionately large net contributions. The combination of pressures from, above all, Holland, and to some extent, Germany and Sweden, makes it politically difficult to perpetuate the idea that Britain is uniquely disadvantaged and needs special treatment. That will become even more difficult to sustain once the Community is enlarged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not doubt that it is a real political problem. I sympathise with the Minister; I understand that she must fight her corner for Britain and I support her in that. I also understand the point made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that we must all be active in defending British interests. However, in so doing, we must not lose sight of the bigger picture. In the longer term, there must be a much more satisfactory basis for funding the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
The papers before us reveal some of the mechanisms that we should consider and should argue for much more positively and proactively. The first option is the use of the value added tax system as the underlying basis. The papers make the case that that would probably be unsatisfactory because valued added tax is a regressive system, both domestically and internationally, and would result in a disproportionate burden on the poorer countries in Europe that consume a higher proportion of their national income. The value added tax route, therefore, does not seem to be the best one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A better option, on broad grounds of principle and practicality, is the use of income—an international income tax, which is essentially what we use when gross domestic product, or gross national product, are used as the basis for calculating contributions. The tables show that we have moved an enormous distance in that direction. In the past two decades, we have moved from GDP determining a minority of contributions to Community funding to its determining roughly half of contributions. That is right: the Government should argue for a movement to a system in which contributions to the European Union budget are determined by the size of national per capita income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That option presents one snag, on which the Minister touched. The choice of our national income as the basis for calculating contributions hinges critically on the exchange rate employed. That is not a problem for other member states, because they have stable and fixed exchange rates, and will shortly have irrevocably fixed exchange rates. However, it is an enormously difficult problem for us, because our exchange rate has been extremely volatile, going up from about DM2.5 to DM3 in the period of the exchange rate mechanism, back down to DM2.5, back up to DM3, and now back again to DM2.8, or probably lower. That raises the question of the appropriate exchange rate at which to fix the conversion into European currency. That is not only a technical issue; it is enormously political.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to say today what she thinks the exchange rate should be; I have been involved with this argument sufficiently long to know that the Government are extremely cautious in that area. However, it is a critical issue and, sooner rather than later, they must start to share their thinking about the exchange rate at which they expect the pound to settle in the long term, relative to other European countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I hope that the Government will be slightly more constructive than they have been in responding to the other suggestions for revenue. Many options may be advantageous in the national interest—such as a withholding tax—or they may be barmy in technical terms. A more constructive review of them would be helpful. It struck me that at least two items on the list invite more than passing reflection. One is the discussion of the energy and CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> tax. I mention that because the Government are currently reviewing the report of the Marshall inquiry. One problem thrown up by that inquiry is that a national system of energy and CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> taxation imposes competitive disadvantages among some parts of manufacturing industry relative to the main competitors, who happen to be in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
It also happens that other European countries are imposing their own energy taxes. It would make sense if they were harmonised from the outset. I merely raise it as an issue—I am not advocating it frantically. However, there does seem to be technical merit—it may prove to be a source of revenue—in examining the idea of approaching the growing enthusiasm of Europe for energy and CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> taxes on a joint basis, with the possibility of joint revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The avenue now being explored by the hon. Gentleman gives me concern about his earlier comments. Perhaps he will clarify a point. Was he suggesting that, in future, contributions to the EU should be made by sovereign member sates, with the amount of the contributions being calculated on the basis of some other mechanism such as national income, or was he proposing that the EU tax British citizens directly and that we should pay part of our income direct to the EU rather than to the Inland Revenue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My view, which is perhaps unique among members of the Committee—although some may sympathise—is that the dominant source of revenue for the EU should be nationally paid contributions based on the ability to pay, which in turn is based on GDP, for which we have argued. In the long run, we should be considering the possibility of the EU having its own source of revenue: there is nothing wrong with that in principle. If an appropriate base for the taxation system exists, we should examine it sympathetically. I raised the possibility of energy taxation as an obvious subject. A new system of taxation is being introduced by national Governments in Europe, quite independently of each other, which is creating all sorts of complications simply because it is being introduced independently. Thinking 10, 15 or 20 years ahead, there is no reason why this type of tax base should not be appropriate for a top-up to contributions to European funding. But I have no difficulty with the philosophical problem that the hon. Gentleman raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are still two hon. Members who wish to speak, and the Minister has a number of matters to which to respond. I should be grateful if contributions were kept rather more brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Gale, for being too generous to members of the Committee. On a final note, another matter that we might consider is seignorage duty. I realise that that is a technical point. However, a lot of revenue will be generated in Europe by the creation of European money, and it is not good enough for the Minister to say that we should not bother about this because we are part of European monetary union—we play a part in the overall decision making as to how EMU will develop. It seems highly appropriate that a major source of revenue that generates to Governments—or to the EU as a result of the creation of the euro—should go to the EU. We should at least be thinking about the technical and practical issues involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
I hope that the Minister, when she replies, will move us a little beyond the defensive role that I understand she must play and deal with these admittedly politically tricky but important questions about how we raise long-term funding for our activities within the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to the extent of the consensus. It is becoming almost unnerving to observe the harmony and consensus that is creeping into our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the debate because it is crucial that we open to the public these budgetary discussions about how the EU of the future will be funded. Obviously, the Government have a role in this. The media also has a significant role—which it does not always usefully fulfil. I came across an example of that recently in, of all places, the 	<i>Financial Times,</i> which stated that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"European Commission will today unveil one of its most closely guarded secrets—exactly how much each member state contributes to the EU budget."</p></blockquote>
That is published annually by the Court of Auditors in the budget annual report; the Committee is discussing it in an informed manner. For a newspaper such as the 	<i>Financial Times</i> to be peddling such misinformation is a major cause for concern. We must do everything that we can to open up such issues. Of course it is right to criticise those aspects of European decision—making and budgetary matters that deserve criticism, but we need a sense of proportion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that my hon. Friend the Minister has set iut clearly the Government's intention to defend the British rebate. That is important not only in principle but politically, so that the forces that argue for a different direction on European matters cannot misrepresent what the Government are saying. When we consider the stark figures—that we are the fourth or fifth largest contributor while being the ninth, 10th or 11th wealthiest nation in the European Union—we cannot defend that system to our constituents. I agree with the hon. Member for Twickenham that during the past two decades we have been moving towards a system that is far more closely associated with relative wealth as expressed through GDP or GNP, and we must continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must face up to the fact that we need fundamental reform—I welcome the Government's emphasis on that. We need reforms of the structural funds that consider not only relative unemployment levels but relative levels of GDP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need to square the circle and face the reality of enlargement. During our question time, I made the point that if we believe in enlargement, either we must greatly expand our structural and regional funds or we must deal with the problem in a different way. We cannot say that we are in favour of enlargement, that we do not want the budget to rise and at the same time that we are not prepared to accept any redistribution of the structural funds within the EU. Politically, we must be honest and up-front about that, and face up to it in our debates. As has been said, without reform, on the current trend, the structural funds would double following the accession of new members in the enlargement process. That is clearly unsustainable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
We also need firm reform of the common agricultural policy. As the Minister said, a good start has been made on that. The Commission's proposals would save the British consumer about £1 billion a year. However, the idea encapsulated in those proposals, that compensation payments to farmers who lose out through the process should continue indefinitely, cannot be defended. Across the EU, more public subsidy goes to agriculture through the CAP than to all the other industrial sectors put together. That explains the fundamental need for reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those reforms must take place relatively speedily. We have already heard the argument that if we allowed a country such as Poland into membership under the current CAP rules, it would take 60 per cent. of the CAP funds overnight. Clearly, that issue must be addressed in the budgetary proposals before we can proceed with enlargement. Given the time scales involved, if we do not achieve budgetary reform during the German presidency, we can forget any prospect of enlargement in 2002. Indeed, we can forget it for significantly longer than that. We would then run the risk of misleading countries that have gone through enormous structural and economic change to meet the criteria for membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the comments by my hon. Friend the Member or Gedling (Mr. Coaker), I would say that we need to restate that the reforms are necessary because we want the budget to cope with the enlargement of the Union. In some senses, it is about a moral and ethical duty to the former eastern block countries, because of the changes that they have made. It is also about our own self-interest. If we allow the huge disparity of wealth between the poorer and richer nations of the European Union to continue, the danger of illegal immigration, drug trafficking and, ultimately, the potential for war, are greatly increased. Business opportunities for Britain will also result from enlargement of the European Union, as the single market will increase Europe's population from 370 million to 460 million people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of other issues have been raised. Concern was expressed about the 2.5 per cent. growth rate assumed in the documents. It is arguable that that may be too high, but as my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said, the budget was based on a percentage of GNP, so even if the growth figure had been overestimated it would not impact on the budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also heard about the need to reform other ways in which Europe does its business, and the need to cut administration costs and the cost of pension arrangements. That is absolutely correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in discussions with the Council of Ministers, my hon. Friend will speak forcefully of the need for such reform, and make a plea for the European Commission to stop scoring own goals. I refer in particular to last week's press report about the fact that European commissioners would continue to receive duty-free allowances while the European Union is pushing ahead to abolish duty-free goods. I welcome the fact that Neil Kinnock, one of our commissioners, has said that he does not intend to take those allowances. However, from the perspective of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
ordinary voter, it is incomprehensible that the Commission should be so politically insensitive. I am sure that my hon. Friend will make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also tackle fraud. I do not defend fraud in the EU in any shape or form. However, it is important to put matters in context. The detailed reports of the Court of Auditors show that the vast bulk of fraud in the EU is the result of the misapplication of funds, false form-filling and the like. It is a bureaucratic problem rather than fraud for personal gain. That point, too, needs to be firmly put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's strategy in the negotiations. I hope that our firmness will be tempered with a realisation of how we can achieve what we want. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford spoke with much relish of defending the British people with the words, "No, no, no." We should learn from the experience of other European nations that it is possible to stand up for one's national interests and to negotiate effectively without creating offence or losing the support of other member states. We need that support to win the argument. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.39 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee does not deem it inappropriate on Armistice day, I shall start with a military metaphor. I believe that the Government have opened a new front today in the battle for the hearts and minds of the British people by initiating a charm offensive on their European policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary is, in every respect, better than the bogey-persons who have previously spoken for Brussels from the Government Front Bench. She comes to these difficult issues with a clear intellect and a ready smile. But those who involve themselves at a high level with European matters always have a ready smile; they have eaten, have they not, of the lotus of privilege that is at the heart of the running of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary spoke of a people's Europe, but those whom I represent—and, I suspect, many of the electors represented by other members of the Committee—are clearly not benefiting from the budget or from much else in the European Union. They see a vista of stretch limos, photo opportunities and l'Europe gastronomique around the Grande Place, which is far removed from the reality of their daily lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harlow spoke with great perception about the perpetuation of duty-free allowances for European commissioners. He could have spoken of the preferential tax regimes that they personally enjoy. His electors who work at Stansted may lose their jobs because of the European Union's withdrawal of duty-free concessions on intra-EU flights, as might my electors who work at Heathrow. We should also bear in mind our huge expenditure in respect of the European Union, which was described in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> on 17 September as "The price that must be paid for friendship". True friendship has no price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are providing £10 million for the destitute people in the four countries of central America that have suffered the effects of the hurricane, yet we provide £10 billion to the "fat cattery" of the European Union. Surely that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
an iniquitous misuse of resources. There are increases in expenditure in most of the categories listed in the financial perspective, such as that for agriculture. No doubt set-aside will be well provided for; more money will go to the big landowners for growing nothing. Tell that to the banana farmers of Honduras. They have already suffered enough from the EU banana regime. The big agriculturists in east Anglia and elsewhere will do very well out of the set-aside regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the internal and external policies, administration and accession financing? There will continue to be—even after enlargement—a need for cohesion and structural funding, but it will have its cost. That cost is in the livelihoods of our people, because it will make it easier—does it not?—for our competitors to gain an advantage at the expense of British industry and exporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission is perhaps realising that its forecasts for the growth of both existing and prospective member states of the European Union are likely to be wildly wrong—certainly over a quinquennial perspective. It adumbrates a series of potential additional imposts. Let us go through them: for example, a CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub -->—energy tax. We live in a global economic environment. If nothing else, surely the present recession has brought that home. Do we want to hobble our industry further? Because of the different patterns of production, it is appropriate for there to be different patterns of energy taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about modulated VAT? Is zero rating for children's clothing, books and so on, as we have in this country, to go by the board? What do our electors think about that? I need not say anything more about personal income tax. What about withholding tax on interest income, which was described so graphically by my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford as having a dire impact on the City of London?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter attracted me, as it did the hon. Member for Twickenham: the European central bank seignorage. How marvellous! Let them all pay; let them join the euro and pay for it twice—pay for the cost of transition and everything else, then pay a tax on top. We will be exempt from all that and we will have a wonderful, competitive advantage. For once, the Liberal Democrats seem to be talking sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a serious matter, but disparities in the net contribution most concern members of the Committee. Increasing resentment at those disparities will grow in the European Union, and at the fact that the EU will seek over time, because its appetite for more money is insatiable, to acquire new powers of taxation. I suspect that our electors will not be prepared forever to pay the EU's price for its friendship. It will probably all end with a Boston tea party of a bust up; that is regrettable. The danger of having taxation imposed that is not approved by the electors is that it will lead to resentment and more tension, rather than more friendship in the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin by expressing my gratitude, to the hon. Member for Maldon and East
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Chelmsford for his extremely kind remarks. I assure him that all my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Treasury work just as hard as me. I am sure that he will have observed that the Treasury is at the bottom of the league table of sick leave in Departments. My civil servants take less sick leave, on average, than those in the private sector, and as far as I can see, Ministers take no leave at all. However, as he and other hon. Members have said, this has been an immensely useful debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked a specific question about where the savings in the budget that we are seeking will come from. In order to achieve our stabilisation target for 2006, savings must come from all parts of the budget. Our focus is on that end point for the new financial perspective in 2006. The path of spending between 1999 and 2006 will be discussed further during negotiations with our partners. The hon. Gentleman referred to the United Kingdom abatement, quoted the recent remarks of a Dutch Minister and suggested that we might be isolated in this matter. ECOFIN discussions are confidential, and I must respect that, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Netherlands Government have recently published a document in which they approvingly refer to the target of 85 billion ecu as the stabilisation target for 2006. Several other member states also agree with that target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the issues that the hon. Members for Maldon and East Chelmsford and for Twickenham raised at some length on the Commission's various proposals for a variety of EU taxes and own resources. The huge variability in tax structure, as well as rates across the EU, make it extremely improbable that agreement would be reached. I stress again that taxation policy remains a key national competence. Corporation tax was mentioned. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford will know that the Government have cut corporation tax to 30 per cent., and to 20 per cent. for small companies, which is significantly lower than under his Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the hon. Members for Maldon and East Chelmsford and for Twickenham raised the fascinating matter of seignorage tax. Let me make it clear that a seignorage tax would effectively represent a tax on the profits of national central banks. Therefore, if it were applied across the 15 member states, it would raise a particular problem for those countries, such as the United Kingdom, which are not members of EMU. Support among member states for the EU having its own direct power to levy VAT, which has been on the agenda since the early 1960s, has been diminishing rather than increasing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making an important and welcome point about seignorage. I may have badly misunderstood, or perhaps she needs to educate me further—probably both. If the United Kingdom were outside the single currency, how would the tax be imposed on those countries within the euro system? Surely their central banks will have virtually zero function when the European central bank has taken over. How will the tax be levied? How will it work? What will be the difference between its impact on those countries within the euro zone and those outside it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the hon. Gentleman is taking me into realms of detail that the Commission might not yet have considered. As I understand the proposal, the revenue from seignorage in EMU member countries should be pooled and then redistributed back to central banks under a formula related to GNP. If the seignorage revenue in all member states were to be taxed, it would represent a tax on the profits of central banks, which we would be unwilling to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the specific issue of VAT. Taxation is, and must remain, a key matter of national competence, because our constituents, our electors, hold national Governments accountable for taxes and, therefore, we must have powers over them. Any direct levy on VAT would make VAT much more complicated for Governments and business, especially small businesses. Again, we would be unwilling to accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford specifically referred to defence and a common security policy. Co-operation in defence policy means precisely that; it does not involve any proposal to increase spending or, therefore, contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made some extremely important points about United Kingdom contributions and the broader budgetary context for contributions and receipts. It is relevant to stress that, for every pound that the United Kingdom receives from, for example, structural funds, we pay £1.50 in contributions. He and the hon. Member for Twickenham both raised the important issue of whether contributions should be based instead on GNP. Clearly, such a proposal would have significant advantages, of both equity and simplicity, in calculating national contributions. However, given the imbalance in receipts, an abatement for the United Kingdom contribution would still be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true to say that the United Kingdom would benefit from a GNP-based contribution, but it would be immensely difficult to negotiate such a shift for the reason, which I think the hon. Member for Twickenham recognises, that any state would be reluctant to concede an increase in their share of contributions and any shift to GNP-based contributions would, of course, require unanimity. If that proposal were pursued, we would carefully consider the important issue of exchange rates, to which the hon. Member for Twickenham referred and to which I shall return later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset made a fascinating contribution and many references, which I shall not pursue, to therapy. I would not wish to intrude on private grief, but perhaps I might be permitted to observe that the agreement that we have achieved between the parties in Committee this morning has been much easier than reaching agreement between members of the hon. Gentleman's party on the vexed issue of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not the conflict of views, either within my mind or within the Government, that the hon. Member for West Dorset suggested; there are different objectives which need to be balanced and progressed simultaneously. There is the objective of helping underdeveloped regions, whether through regional policy within the United Kingdom and, indeed, other member states, or through the structural funds within the union as a whole. There is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
objective of reforming the common agricultural policy in the interests of consumers and taxpayers alike. Moreover, there is the goal of achieving a fair balance in national contributions. We must pursue all those objectives at the same time, within an envelope of financial discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman elaborated further on the specific question for cohesion funds and structural funds. They serve different purposes. As I am sure that the Committee knows, the cohesion funds are specifically designed to enable countries to meet the Maastricht criteria and thus qualify for the third stage of EMU—the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates. Any countries that continue to qualify for cohesion funds should receive an allocation nearer to the average for the period 1994–99, rather than at the all-time high levels of 1999. It is because the cohesion funds are designed to enable poorer countries to reach Maastricht criteria that we consider that once they have achieved those criteria and joined the third stage of EMU, further payments from the cohesion funds should not be necessary.

The structural funds are different. As I said, their objective is to moderate the regional imbalances that occur within nations, as well as across the European Union as a whole. My hon. Friend the Member for Gedling raised our eyes to the grander vision of Europe, to which I know that all my hon. Friends subscribe. He vividly reminded us that the enlargement of the European Union, which we seek, will bring in the former communist countries—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over time, many of them. Enlargement will bring the former communist countries into a common framework of human rights, economic dynamism and social justice. My hon. Friend also raised the important issues of fraud and maladministration within the European Union. It was a major priority of the United Kingdom presidency to improve the financial management of the Community and to fight fraud. That is why we are extremely interested in the European Parliament's proposal for an independent fraud office.

My hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford also raised the issue of reform of the common agricultural policy. As we said in our manifesto, it is essential that we reform the CAP. The Commission accepts the need for reform. What is unacceptable is that the increased level of taxpayer-funded compensation to farmers, which is the price of negotiating reform of the CAP, should be made permanent. The Commission proposes that the compensation payments to farmers within the existing 15 member states should be permanent, but should not be matched by compensation payments to farmers in new member states. That is not sustainable or fair.

The hon. Member for Twickenham raised the question of convergence of living standards and of whether or not we are above the average. That is precisely where the exchange rate becomes so important. If we apply purchasing power parity, we find that we are still below average in terms of per capita GDP. The essential point, as I stressed earlier, is that, as we were in 1984, we are still 10th among the current 15 members, but we are still contributing more than several wealthier member states.

As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, energy tax is a matter for consideration and discussion in many other member states—most notably Germany. We will pursue that matter in particular as we consult on the recommendations in Lord Marshall's report.

My hon. Friend the Member for Harlow also stressed the need for common agricultural policy reform. I hope that I have already responded to at least one of his concerns. On his point about the Commission's assumptions about GNP growth, as I said, we believe that the 2.5 per cent. assumption is over-optimistic. The own resources ceiling is set as a proportion of GNP, and thus rises with GNP. The financial perspective is set in billions of euros, not as a proportion of GNP. That is why we need a margin between the financial perspective and the ceiling, to allow for the possibility that growth will not meet the assumptions upon which the Commission bases its figure. We can achieve that necessary margin through our plans for stabilisation. We have a clear strategy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
