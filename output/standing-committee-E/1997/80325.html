	<p>Bananas</p>
	<p>[	<i>Relevant document: Council Regulation (EC) No. 2686/94 of 31 October 1994 establishing a special system of assistance to traditional ACP suppliers of bananas.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak today about a policy on which there has been a rare unity of view among successive Administrations over many years. That policy is partly due to our colonial history. The Government accept, as did the previous Administration, that our historic links with the countries of the Commonwealth Caribbean, which depend on bananas for much of their export revenue, mean that we have to temper our usual enthusiasm for liberal trading arrangements with our concern for those small and potentially fragile economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the early 1950s the then Government encouraged the people of the Windward Islands to begin banana production by assuring them, and other Caribbean suppliers, of priority in our market for all the fruit that they could grow that was of saleable quality. Over the next 40 years, our national arrangements for banana imports guaranteed Caribbean growers returns that kept a significant share of the work force in banana production in the Windwards, in some parts of Jamaica and, more recently, in Belize.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU banana regime, agreed in principle under the previous United Kingdom presidency in 1992, replaced our national arrangements, and those of other European Union member states, with a harmonised system. As well as bringing those differing arrangements into line with the requirement for the free movement of bananas within the single market, the regime also attempted to meet three other, apparently irreconcilable, concerns—the EU's commitments to traditional banana suppliers in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries under the fourth Lomé convention, protection for EU producers under a common agricultural policy regime and our obligations under the World Trade Organisation rules. I suspect that our discussions this morning will highlight those apparently irreconcilable concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regime, which has now been in place for nearly five years, has remained controversial both inside and outside the EU. I will concentrate on the external challenges, because they have provided the driving force for change. A GATT challenge by five Latin American banana-producing countries—all of whom are, I believe, technically republics—soon after the regime came into
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
effect in 1993 was partially resolved when four of them, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Colombia, signed a banana framework agreement with the EU during the final settlement of the Uruguay round. However, the fragile peace that followed the implementation of this agreement in 1995 was disturbed by a further challenge under the new stricter WTO rules and procedures that were adopted in the Uruguay round. That complaint, if I could term it thus, came from Guatemala and Mexico—joined by Honduras and Ecuador, which had recently joined the World Trade Organisation—and the United States of America, which is not famed for its banana production. We now have to grapple with the legal issues thrown up by the WTO ruling on this latter challenge as we try to reach agreement on a revised WTO-consistent arrangement during the UK's current presidency of the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been clear to us since the WTO appellate body gave its final ruling on the EU regime last September that the findings pose severe political and economic difficulties for some of our historical trading partners in the Caribbean. When my right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food went to St. Lucia in January to talk to Caribbean leaders and hear their concerns, he gave them assurances of his determination to ensure that their interests were taken fully into account in the negotiations that are now underway in Brussels. He made it clear that Caribbean growers must be given the opportunity to prove that they can sustain a viable industry committed to providing a good quality product to the European consumer at a competitive price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As firm adherents of the multilateral system, we have also accepted—ever since the latest WTO challenge began two years ago—that, in the event of an adverse ruling, the EU would have to bring its banana import arrangements into line with that ruling. The EU committed itself to do that last October and has been given until 1 Janaury next year to get a revised WTO-compatible system into place. That gives the UK Government a pivotal role in getting that agreement into place during their EU Presidency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once we had looked at the complex legal ruling handed down by the WTO appellate body, we had to make a decision on the broad approach to be taken by the EU in response to the rulings. One possibility was to take the current arrangements, which are based on tariffs, quotas and licences, and change the elements that had been criticised by the WTO. Those elements included the main bone of contention in the dispute, the import licensing system, and in particular the B licences that have provided an incentive to traders to market Caribbean bananas. They also included the way in which the EU had shared out its market between supplying countries with quotas for specific countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another approach, suggested primarily by the United States of America, was to sweep away quotas and licences, and protect ACP countries through an increased tariff preference. Given the complexities of the WTO findings, that is undoubtedly appealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are drawbacks. Such radical change in response to the first adverse WTO ruling would set an unwelcome precedent for the EU. Latin Americans, whose agreement would be needed, would face rises in the tariff barrier on their banana exports. Most importantly, from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
the UK standpoint, at last autumn's Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Edinburgh, Caribbean leaders made it clear that their preferred solution was to continue with as much of the present tariff quota regime as it was possible to salvage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission has therefore, sensibly in our view, set itself the task of making the current arrangements conform with WTO findings by proposing changes to the import licensing rules and to the way that the EU market is shared out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have assessed the proposal which Commissioner Fischler presented to the Agriculture Council in January against two key criteria. We have assessed whether the proposal goes as far as it can to protect the interests of Caribbean producers: as I have said, that is a priority for us. We have also assessed whether the proposal constitutes a defensible response to the WTO findings on the banana regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our first key test was the protection of Caribbean ACP interests. We and the Caribbean leaders must accept that the revised arrangements will not be as favourable as those that we have at present. B licences will go, as will individual export allocations to ACP countries. That is a major anxiety for some Caribbean producers, especially those in the Windward Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's analysis of the WTO ruling is that there is no way in which the EU can continue to offer ACP countries individual guarantees of access to its market, so we have reluctantly conceded that the unallocated global volume of 857,700 tonnes for duty-free imports from traditional ACP suppliers is the best that can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
WTO compatibility was even more difficult to assess than the protection of Caribbean ACP interests. The WTO complainants, led by the United States of America—which, as I have said, is not famed for banana production—have lost no time in claiming that the arrangements proposed by the Commission would not be consistent with WTO rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some EU member states have taken up this claim: as I said, there has been continuing dispute inside and outside the EU. The Commission, which has responsibility for defending its proposals, has provided member states with a comprehensive analysis of its response to the WTO findings in devising revised arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there are still some uncertainties on the WTO aspects, the Government have concluded that the proposal represents a carefully judged reconciliation of the EU' s obligations under the WTO and its commitments to the ACP countries under the Lomé convention. Although the proposal does not—and probably cannot—meet Caribbean anxieties in every respect, it is, in our view, the best one they are likely to get in the wake of the WTO ruling. The proposal for a new framework of assistance for traditional African, Caribbean and Pacific producers, for which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development has responsibility, should help the highest-cost producers adjust to the changed circumstances and to the tougher competition that they will face in the European Union market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
I apologise for the length of the statement. The matter is complicated, and the Committee needs as much background information as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Scrutiny Committee has asked that the aid proposal be debated alongside the proposed revisions to the trade regime, and I shall be glad to take questions from hon. Members about the Commission package. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development is attending his first European Standing Committee—a new experience that I am sure that he will enjoy. I am sure that he will be able to answer any questions that I cannot deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have decided to concentrate our efforts on getting revised arrangements, on the lines of the Commission proposal, agreed by the end of our European Union presidency in June. That will not be easy, given the persistent disagreements within the European Union about bananas. However, we are encouraged that no member state—not even one of those that favour freer trading arrangements—has refused to negotiate on the basis of the Commission's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been pushing ahead as quickly as we can. After initial discussion at the January Agriculture Council, a technical working group completed a thorough examination of the proposal, before reporting back to the Special Committee on Agriculture and to the February Council. There was a further discussion in the Special Committee earlier this week. We expect to keep up the pace so that we can reach a conclusion before the end of June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Members understand why I have spoken for longer than usual, and I am grateful for your forebearance, Mr. Maxton. It is a complicated issue, in which the decisions of the Government and of the European Union will affect the livelihoods and the futures of many of our historical trading partners in the Commonwealth of Caribbean countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the period set aside for questions to the Minister. That period can go on to 11.30 am at the latest. I remind the Committee that the Minister will answer questions during this period. The Under-Secretary of State for International Development may take part in the later debate, but he cannot answer questions. Hon. Members' questions must be brief and they must be asked one at a time. Hon. Members have the opportunity to ask further questions when they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I start by welcoming you, Mr. Maxton, to the Chair. It is the first time that I have served under you, and I hope that the experience proves satisfactory for both of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his opening statement. He is right that the matter is complex and that there has been continued agreement over the need to protect the interests of former colonies and remaining dependent territories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start by asking the Minister about tonnages. He mentioned a figure of 857,700 tonnes. Am I right in thinking that that is the overall ACP quota and not the historical achievement which, as we know, is less? Will he explain in greater detail how he anticipates that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
producers—will export their bananas to Europe and the United Kingdom? How will that tonnage work out, given that in the past the countries have held individual licences? If production continues to rise, how will they decide which countries are filling the quota and which exceeding it, or will there be a free-for-all? Will he explain how the removal of individual allocations would work in practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's question, which he is right to ask. The short answer is that only time will tell. I gave the overall figure of 857,700 tonnes at zero duty, but other figures have changed. There will be a 2.2-million-tonne tariff quota for other imports and, of course, an additional autonomous tariff quota of 353,000 tonnes for newcomers. Some of that could be shared by ACP countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right—some ACP countries could go over their historical quota while others are not producing up to that quota. There have been allegations that production in some countries has dropped, but it is not possible to get wholly reliable figures for that. We are trying to get Caribbean banana producers to achieve professionalism in their industry so that we know what is happening. The figure will be an overall figure for those ACP countries; operating individual quotas is not compatible with the WTO decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a fairly small percentage of the total imports into the European Union: we import 20 per cent. of our bananas from ACP countries, and European Union banana production itself represents 17 per cent. of the total. Dollar bananas, which are the threat, already have 63 per cent. of the market. The 857,000 tonnes will represent the first call on the ACP countries. Some of those countries will take time to fill that quota. They will have access to the other two parts of the quota of 353,000, which will come in at a different level of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the countries divide up that quota will be a matter for law. It will not be possible for them to divide it up by discussion among themselves because there could be a complaint under the WTO rules if it is thought that the Caribbean producers are operating a cartel to divide up their overall quota.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be some time before those countries reach that quota, but it is too early to say what the impact will be on individual countries. The Windward Islands' production is 30 to 50 per cent. of their export earnings, which is 5 to 6 per cent. of their gross domestic product and a substantial part of their economy. The quota represents a massive change for such countries, but they cannot home in on particular quota figures that they had in the past. They will have to work within the overall total, and there will be a problem if some countries exceed their quota and push out others from the duty-free part of quota.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the fact that dollar bananas represent 63 per cent. of the market, it is obvius that the dominance of American multinational companies is profound. Will my hon. Friend comment on how much influence American multinationals have had on the European decision-making process and how that will impact on international development issues within the Caribbean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. As I said, dollar banana production, which does not include the United States of America, already has 63 per cent. of the market. Large companies are involved in the marketing, supply and ripening of bananas. I do not know what influence they have had, but they have had none in the European Union, as far as I know. I suspect that some of those companies have made complaints to the World Trade Organisation. They are large companies and some are very old. Chiquita, which is almost 100 years old, has powerful interests in the United States. Caribbean countries are, to put it mildly, quite unhappy about the activities and perceived lobbying of multinational companies in the United States that encouraged the USA to make its complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has highlighted a difficult issue that involves very small countries. Their whole economy could be wrecked and they could be forced, in the belly of the United States, to start growing other cash crops. Such crops could be hightly damaging to their economies and to other people's health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. As the hon. Gentleman says, countries could start growing crops that we and they think would not be in their interests. Some people have expressed atronishment that the United States has sought to snuff out—that is their phrase, not mine—some of the fragile conomies in the Caribbean by complaining to the WTO on behalf of dollar banana producers, having been pushed by some of the multinational companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Maxton, may I say how delighted I am to be under your chairmanship? This is the first time that I have had the privilege. How will the Minister ensure that banana farmers from traditinal suppliers such as the Windward Islands in the West Indies will get the higher price if the B licence system, which delivers it, is eliminated? The sale of B licences enables banana farmers to get extra money. The B licence sometimes sell for $6, which is passed back to the banana farmer. Farmers get $10—US dollars—a box as opposed to $5 a box for bananas from central America. That is a $5 gap. How will the Minister make certain that that $5 continues to return to banana farmers in the West Indies if the B licence system is abolished?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised an important issue. The answer will be determined only in negotiations, which are on-going. I cannot spell out matters any more clearly than I did in my opening statement. Even if we get an agreement on the European Commission's proposals that is not subject to attack or challenge in the WTO, Carribean banana producers are in danger of losing out financially. That is why it is crucial that there is an aid programme to assist them. They will have to become more efficient, but that will be difficult because they will lose not only the B licences, but hurricane licences and other assistance. The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Wells) is probably much better acquainted with the matter than I am, but we have not supported Caribbean banana producers in the most brilliantly efficient economic way. Our approach has grown like Topsy over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
The issue will be a matter for negotiation. The B licences will go and there will be transitional payments and arrangements for aid to banana producers. In that way, they will still be able to maintain a good-quality product—if the quality is not there, their bananas will not be sold in the European market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a major problem, but there is no guaranteed answer as to how to get the money that would have come from the subsidy arrangement under the B licences to Caribbean producers. I regret to say that no provisions are currently in place in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The United States is not a banana producer, but seems to be behind the pressure that has been put on the WTO to make life more difficult for the Caribbean producers. Has the European Union or the Government had discussions with the United States Government on the issue? What reasons are the US Government giving for putting pressure on the WTO to make life more difficult for Caribbean producers? Is it purely because the US Government want fairer trade or does it have something to do with the commercial interests of US-owned companies involved in banana production in Latin America?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the first part of my hon. Friend's question is yes. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary reminds me that my hon. and noble Friend Lord Simon, the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness in Europe, has had discussions. I have met American leaders and the Chairman of the Select Committee on Agriculture. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has met the United States Secretary of Agriculture on more than one occasion and has raised the issue of bananas. In addition, discussions have taken place with Caribbean producers. The United States has made it clear that it is operating under World Trade Organisation rules, which were tightened up after the last Uruguay round—that enabled the complaint to be made in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I call the old Commonwealth preferences have been under attack for a long time. They are an anachronism within the European Union, but they exist. They go against our arguments for open trade, the single market and liberalisation simply because of our political, economic, historical and cultural links with our Caribbean partners. The Americans have relied on the WTO. There have been allegations—I do not make them, but I have read them—about the funding of political parties in the United States by some of those multinational companies, but I do not know the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you, Mr. Maxton, to the Chair and I congratulate you on having two Ministers in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food made any assessment of whether, when—as I hope—the new arrangement comes into place, British consumers will have to pay more, the same or less for their bananas? I purchased the banana that I have in my hands in the Members' Tea Room for 25p.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There should be no effect on the price of bananas in this country; an increase is not expected. The Commission's view is that current supply levels of bananas will remain unchanged and—one has to make certain assumptions—the price of bananas will not increase. Some EU member states think that the higher tariff on the autonomous quota—that is the 353,000 tonnes, on which there is a large tariff of 300 ecu per tonne—will reduce supplies and lead to higher prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want prices to rise in this country; that is not our intention. Bananas are cheaper in real terms than they have ever been. Although I am a banana eater, I was astonished to learn that bananas are the top-selling fruit in the United Kingdon. Consumption has doubled in the past 12 years, from 300,000 tonnes to 700,000 tonnes, and it is a £600 million industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New Labour, new bananas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New Labour, new bananas, as the former Minister says. They may call this the new banana Committee—with two Ministers present, it gives a new meaning to the term "banana republic".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because bananas are the top-selling fruit, it is in no one's interest to agree to a regime that will jack up the price unnecessarily. Far be it from that—the price needs to be lower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as taxpayers are concerned, expenditure on aid to the few European Union producers will remain at current levels, but revenues will increase as a result of the higher tariff on the autonomous quota. In conclusion, we do not expect and are not planning for an increase in the price of bananas for British consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Abbot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will know not only that bananas are Britain's top-selling fruit, but that Caribbean bananas taste better. Is there a risk of any individual ACP state being unable to export its tradition volume of bananas because of other states pre-empting the quota?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so. There is a possible threat simply because at the moment, each state is allocated part of the global figure of 850,000 tonnes. Some do not meet it, and others could move ahead more quickly and push them out. For example, the Dominican Republic is not a traditional ACP state. We must be mindful of Belize, which has supplied more or less twice as much—some 40,000 tonnes—as its normal quota of about 20,000 tonnes. Obviously, if Belize's figure were pushed down by half, its banana industry would be snuffed out. We must be mindful of that. Protection cannot be guaranteed simply because quota licences for individual countries will be outlawed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) is quite right. I am not conscious of having eaten dollar bananas; I like Caribbean bananas. Bananas are a very healthy product. My constituents and my hon. Friends know the difference between a Caribbean banana and a dollar banana. They will know which is the right one to buy for a certain quality.

There is clearly a risk under the regime. It is the Government's job to get behind the best deal in the negotiations—the European Union plan—and to ensure that it is fully supported by all the member states. As I said, not all of them are on board. We are not, however, having too many problems at present. We must ensure that the deal is compatible with WTO rules. If it is not, we will face another complaint in the near future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the Government's primary policy objective regarding bananas is the same as that of the previous Government—to do all that is possible to protect the best interests of our Caribbean, Commonwealth colleagues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. One reason my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food went to the Windward Islands in early January, in the Christmas recess, was to see Prime Ministers and leaders—especially in the Windward Islands—at first hand, to discuss the situation and to listen to the concerns of banana producers on their home territory. That visit occurred in addition to the may meetings that the Government have had in London. We are giving the matter priority. My right hon. Friend will seek a satisfactory solution, insofar as the Government are able while we have the presidency and my right hon. Friend chairs the key Committees. Our priorities are Caribbean producers, WTO compatibility and the reaching of an agreement before the presidency concludes at the end of June.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the presidency will be used to seek an agreement quickly and before the end of Britain's term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document points out that the relative high cost of production in the Caribbean and the relative low cost in central America are due mainly to geographical conditions such as soil. If the WTO conditions are to be met, the small producers in the Caribbean will suffer at the end of the day—there will be high unemployment. No doubt many American property speculators will move in and clean up on land that has been laid waste because banana production has ceased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand how the EU, which is, after all, a fairly important partner in trading around the world, has allowed the WTO to make a decision that is clearly very strongly against the interests of Caribbean producers. They have strong historical ties to Britain, and some ties to France and Spain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell me whether the Government are prepared to mount a serious challenge—perhaps through the EU—to the thinking behind the WTO ruling? It is killing communities and economies and sucking the very lifeblood out of small islands such as those in the Caribbean which have no obvious alternative source of production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ruling to which my hon. Friend refers is the first adverse WTO ruling from which the European Union has suffered. That has coloured the process in some ways. If the European Union is rolled over, and further complaints are made, there is a danger that other European
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Union regimes will come under attack from the WTO. We must therefore work within the rules of the WTO. As I said, the Government have some irreconcilable goals. There will be no single winner. We have to be WTO-compatible, otherwise European Union regimes will constantly be under attack from other countries. In this case, they are the dollar banana producers, led and pushed by the United States of America, which has a different agenda from the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends have alluded to the complaints that have been made about the actions of some multinationals. There were allegations that some of the payments to the political parties were made on a staged basis as the WTO went through its appellant process. If a country is seen to be buying WTO decisions, that is out of bounds, although we have no proof that that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also explain to the WTO and the United States that we have responsibilities under the fourth Lomé convention in particular, which we want to maintain for all the reasons that we have given. We have also explained to the United States that it is not in its interests to have the Caribbean countries' economies severely damaged, as they might be if things go badly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that this is the first adverse ruling under the WTO. As I said earlier, there were provisions in the general agreement on tariffs and trade which preceded the WTO, but we must comply with the WTO rules, otherwise there will be anarchy in international trade, which is a problem. That means that changes will have to be made in the Caribbean banana-producing countries. To facilitate such changes, they need an aid programme, which also needs to be compatible with the World Trade Organisation rulings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Maxton. I echo the welcome that my colleagues have given to you, and hope that you enjoy your time as Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one very simple question for the Minister. How will the new global ACP quota be divided up among the ACP countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, I cannot answer that question: it is too early to say. In a way, the premise of the hon. Gentleman's question gets to the kernel of the argument. If the quota is seen to be divided up and shared out between particular countries, one of the dollar banana producers is bound to complain to the World Trade Organisation that someone is fixing the market inside that total. It is too early to say how it will flow at the end of the period; it may take one, two or more years to find out. Some of the producers have not reached their ceiling, but as I mentioned, Belize is already over its ceiling as based on former production. That would cause problems; no one wants to snuff out banana production in Belize, but it is extremely vulnerable under this arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobbin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say something about the market for organic bananas? Will they be subject to the same fair trading rules and regulations as Caribbean bananas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a niche market for organic bananas. I freely admit that I have not seen one, but we are intent on encouraging the consumption of organic

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
food. There is no doubt that fewer pesticides mean healthier food, and it also means that seasonal produce is genuinely seasonal. There are also fair trade or ethical bananas, which need to be part of the longer term marketing strategy. The Caribbean producers could promote and market such produce, providing a quality saleable product for the European Union. We in the European Union have some rules about organic produce to which we intend to stick, irrespective of recent press reports about the Untied States redefining its produce. We will maintain our existing definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will do everything we can to encourage Caribbean producers to go for niche markets. That could protect their position, because niche markets are new. Productivity and quality must be improved in the Caribbean, and I suppose that those changes will be forced on the producers there. We will do anything we can, particularly within the aid programme, to encourage niche markets and niche production such as organic bananas, and have in fact had discussions about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On aid, which has been touched on I appreciate that the Minister may need to put some of the information on ice until the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), has spoken, but I hope that he can answer the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is clearly concern about the impact of aid on the ACP countries, particularly the Windward Islands. Can the Minister explain how it is proposed that the aid programme will work and how it will be funded? Will the money come from the economic development fund or from elsewhere? How will it be targeted to individual countries and, within the countries, to individual producers? Will it be a direct income replacement or aid for specific production development purposes? Can the Minister tell us more about how the aid programme is envisaged, how the aid will be apportioned and who will monitor the development of the ACP countries' ability to produce bananas competitively?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's questions and I shall do my best to answer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aid plans are not simply for bananas, although they are intended to improve banana production and the quality of bananas and, as I said, to encourage the move into niche markets. Although we supprot the principle of providing aid to the traditional banana suppliers, who need assistance to adjust to the new market conditions created by the WTO ruling, what is important is not just the quantity of aid, but its quality and effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aid programme is also concerned with alternative forms of employment. Some of the small banana producers may go out of production, and that is certainly not part of the plan. The Department of International Development suggested education as a broader development activity, and more work on tourism and diversification into other crops that can be produced on the same terrain. Therefore, the aid will not be simply for banana production; it must go beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
There is no doubt that there will be changes in the Caribbean countries. As I said earlier, they supply only 20 per cent. of our produce. If we took all the dollar banana production, the figure would be 83 per cent. and there would be other grounds for complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the assistance programme will not be simply for bananas, but in respect of other crops, education and tourism. We shall see whether small countries with fragile economies will move from one industry to another to keep employment as high as possible. However, we shall ensure that the aid is directed in such a way that the countries move into sustainable, responsible development and industry and are not forced, as many people fear, into producing goods that would be highly damaging for themselves and for citizens of the United States.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that if the system outlined by the Minister of an overall 857,000 tonne quota is not allocated between suppliers, that quota will go to the lowest cost producers? Those will clearly be the west African countries—the Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon in particular, and of course Belize. Therefore, the bananas will be imported from there because they will be lower priced than the Windward Islands bananas. The Minister has described the death knell of the Windward Islands banana producer, unless he can find a way of allocating quota to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain why, he must get rid of the B-licence system? It is not the subject of the WTO ruling, which simply objects to the allocation of quota. The B-licence system was not under attack from the WTO, so why abolish it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not my understanding of the situation. The licensing system that has operated since the last round in 1992 will have to go. There is no way around that. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] Because we need to comply with the WTO ruling. In its appeal decision, the WTO upheld the principle of preferred treatment of the ACP countries under the Lomé convention. That is why we still have the global total and the tariff quota arrangements with three levels of 2.2 million tonnes, about 350,000 tonnes and about 850,000 tonnes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key feature of the import licensing system—the B licences—was found to be incompatible with the WTO rules. The licences act as an incentive to traders to handle ACP and EU bananas. The hurricane licences—which allowed shortfalls in supplies to be made up by bananas from other sources, when Caribbean production was affected—were also found to be incompatible with the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The WTO ruling criticised the way in which the European Union market had been shared out between supplying countries, especially the allocations to the ACP countries. The new regime will need both to protect all the Caribbean suppliers and to be WTO compatible. It will not be easy to meet those demands, which might be irreconcilable. It will require discussion and negotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not in our interests, nor in those of the Caribbean producers, if one or more of them, or the ACP countries, or, as has been said, the African countries, were to snuff out the Caribbean producers. The negotiations must not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
be based on the highly defined divisions of the market that existed under the B licence arrangements. That is a matter for discussion, but the outlook is not good for small producers and the negotiations will not be easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not attempting to put a gloss on these matters, nor do I imply that I have been asked to do so. It will be very difficult to rearrange the old Commonwealth preference, which was our historic trading base. Other members of the European Union also had colonies and feel, rightly, an obligation to protect their industries. Many countries moved into banana production only because, in the 1950s, the UK Government told them to do so. They were told to provide quality saleable produce, and that their markets would be guaranteed. The whole economic ethos of those countries—indeed, of the way of life of their citizens—was based on that promise. We do not want to renege on it. However, we need a system that is WTO compatible and stops further complaints from dollar banana producers. That means that we must abolish the licences, regretful though that will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Best</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Maxton, I, too, welcome you to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to question the Minister about the complexities of the regulation and management of the market, which will continue for some time. If we had ever had any doubts about that, our discussions this morning would have removed them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two members of the Committee have referred to the quality of bananas. I have to confess that bananas are not my favourite fruit; I prefer apples. I can detect a difference in taste between one type of apple and another, but I cannot do so with bananas. However, there is clearly some expertise involved in matters of taste. In that case, marketing might be organised not by shares, but by taste. The provision of a particular quality of bananas might be a way of protecting the Caribbean sources of supply, with which we have some natural affinity and concern. Has the Minister considered further technical and commercial advice relating to that area of the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He is right. In future there may be a possibility for regulatory schemes and codes of practice to benefit the Caribbean—though effective monitoring would be necessary. At present the European Commission is working on an initiative to promote the marketing of fair-trade bananas and to enable member states to organise private sector organisations to certify bananas being produced according to fair-trade criteria. If we could then enter niche markets of good-quality, good-tasting ethical organic bananas, there could be real possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one would then expect a premium on price—part of the process of moving into a niche market. As we know, Dole bananas can be produced much more cheaply than those produced in ACP countries. I hope that before he leave the Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West (Mr. Best) will eat the banana of the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reverting to the question of sharing out the quota, if the Minister is telling us that neither the Government working in conjunction with other EU
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Governments, nor the Governments of the producing countries co-operating with each other can decide on an appropriate share-out, the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford is correct. The market will be dominated by countries that appear to be producing the better or more economical banana.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to borrow my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk's banana. The Minister will recognise that it is difficult for a Windward Island banana to compete with one like my hon. Friends. I agree with the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington that the Caribbean banana is infinitely preferable in taste to the dollar banana, but the average housewife will buy my hon. Friend's banana in preference to the Windward Island banana because it is more competitive in the marketplace. There will be a huge problem in jigging with the quotas in order to perpetuate the growing of bananas in the Windward Islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. I alluded previously to 857,700 tonne overall quota figure and said that 20 per cent. of the EU banana market came from ACP countries. The average tonnage from traditional ACP countries between 1994 and 1996 was 686,786 tonnes—some way below the overall figure. Adding the Dominican Republic—a further 74,000 tonnes— we reach a total of 760,000 tonnes of ACP production. That leaves around 100,000 tonnes of spare capacity in the quota for ACP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the 1997 figures, which will take some time to arrive. When they do, we will be able to estimate how well the ACP countries are doing. Some may call it a day; others may decide to grab the bull by the horns and improve the quality and efficiency of their production through investment. Our aid programme will help them to do so and there may be a reallocation. If, in four or five years, we consider the production and supply from the Windward Islands in the traditional ACP total, we may find that there has been a reorientation of the totality. There is spare capacity within the quota, but it is not possible to find a quick-fix solution, which is one of the great problems that we face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Maxton, to the Chair. I am pleased to be a member of the Committee and to attend this sitting, which is important for small banana producers. Like many hon. Members here, I am concerned about USA involvement in the World Trade Organisation. Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that it is regrettable that, because the USA is backing the large multinationals, there is a danger of bringing the organisation into disrepute? Will the ACP countries have any opportunity to develop enough to compete, bearing in mind the terrain in which they have to work? Are we not in danger of expecting them to produce something that they are not capable of producing? Should not the USA and other large markets respect those countries?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents refer to amounts of bananas that are substantial as far as Europe is concerned, but they are particularly substantial in the view of the countries that produce them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The United States has what used to be termed—this is not my phrase; I am speaking on behalf of the Government—its client

states in Latin America, many of which are dollar banana producers. Although it is not a banana producer, the USA participated in the complaint to the WTO, and I have no doubt that that gave the complaint some clout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have told the USA that this is not a straightforward trade matter; it involves political and cultural issues and our historical trading links. There are also our long-standing commitments and those of our European partners such as France, to former colonies involving the production of food for our domestic markets. We have, therefore, a moral obligation, which is why we had discussions at the Lomé convention to enable us to carry on as we were. We freely accept that that is not compatible with liberalised market trading where the price is all. If the price was the be-all and end-all, there would be no banana production in the Caribbean because those countries would not be able to sell their bananas. We tried to put that point to the United States and said that if that were the case, those countries would try to sell something else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I return to the issue of aid? I want to beg to differ with the Minister and I hope that he will re-examine his earlier remarks, when he referred to aid being used not only to help banana production, but to develop the economy in other ways. Page 10 of the document on aid, which contains the Council regulation that establishes a special framework of assistance to traditional ACP suppliers of bananas, clearly states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effectiveness of these measures will be judged by not only the maintenance of the ACP traditional suppliers' current share of the EU banana market under the modified market conditions but also an improvement of the competitiveness".</p></blockquote>
That tells me that the whole aid package is designed to improve the ability of those countries to compete in the banana market. Will the Minister tell us how the EU came to use that aid to improve competitiveness?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that we have here many documents. We do not consider the aid to be exclusively for banana production. Aid is given to banana producers, but the aid programme is to encourage diversification and alternative production and to reorientate and boost tourism, which is a major part of the economies of those countries, and a sustainable industry. In that respect, it is not just for bananas, but banana producers. Part of the aid will be to encourage quality and the more efficient production of bananas insofar as that is possible, given the nature of the climate. It is a long-term, not short-term solution. There are opportunities to develop other exports such as cut flowers and pot plants, and to produce fruit and vegetables for local and tourist consumption and for export—both in the region and internationally. Food and agroprocessing industries also have growth potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aid programme can assist those countries to diversify from bananas, as well as help to make banana production more efficient. I say to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that the aid will not go exclusively to banana production. The United Kingdom wants to broaden the focus, irrespective of our responsibilities in the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have now reached the end of the questions, so I call the Minister to move the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 5357/98, a draft Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No. 404/93 on the common organisation of the market in bananas and a draft Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate with countries having a substantial interest in the supply of bananas to the EU, and European Community Document No. 6150/98, a draft Regulation establishing a special framework of assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas; and supports the Government's position that these proposals together represent a serious attempt to meet the EU's international obligations under the WTO and the Lomé Convention, that revised arrangements must take full account of the interests of those Caribbean countries which have traditionally supplied the UK with bananas and that aid to the Caribbean Commonwealth producers has an important part to play in assisting general adaptation to more competitive market conditions.—[	<i>Mr. Rooker.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.33 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Paice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful exchange of questions, but I fear that the Minister has not yet answered some of them. I hope that either he or his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will do so in their later remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept and agree with the Minister's earlier comment that the measure is an attempt to strike a balance between wanting a liberalised marketplace, while ensuring that countries that are under particular pressures—especially those in the developing world which have only a few options available to them—can continue to produce something that has a world market, even though that may mean the market is slightly tilted in their favour. It is, as the Minister rightly said, part of our Lomé commitment to ensure that those countries have preferential access to our marketplace, and Conservative Members want to see that continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it is important to try to develop their economies in alternative ways, as the Minister explained. However, I want to return to the proposal in the document for a Council regulation establishing a special framework of assistance. Article 3.2 is absolutely clear. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Technical and financial assistance shall be granted to contribute to the implementation of programmes in the banana sector".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to list some of those programmes, but there is no mention in the document of any other economic activity. I accept that UK and European aid is directed towards the wider economic issues and the development of those countries' economies, but the document seems to be entirely directed at developing their ability to compete in the banana market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to explain how the aid that the document sets out to provide will be used to develop those countries' ability to compete, rather than just to prop them up so that they can continue ad infinitum in an uncompetitive situation. Despite the Committee's desire to support those countries, we do not want an open-ended commitment, but want them at some stage to be able to compete in the banana market and to develop and diversify their economies. The aid must be directed towards improving their ability to compete. That may mean developing infrastructure or better marketing or pest control arrangements, instead of simply receiving income support to make up the loss to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford referred
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
There is already a programme of aid to the ACP countries under the existing banana regime. Although the document to which I have just referred says that benefits are perceived—it says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is clear that those projects already completed are having a very positive effect on the level of competitiveness of traditional ACP banana production"</p></blockquote>
—elsewhere it refers to problems of ensuring that the aid is being properly spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot overestimate the importance of this sector to a number of these countries. The Minister threw out some statistics early on. He said that banana production makes up 17 per cent. of the Windward Islands' GDP and that there are some 27,000 producers in those islands, many with what we would describe as very small farms of, on average, about two hectares. On St. Lucia, 30 per cent. of the working population is involved in the banana industry. That is a huge part of the islands' economies, so clearly whatever is done must enable them to continue to prosper, be it in banana production or in other activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has also been made of the situation in Belize, which embarked on a huge investment programme in the early 1990s. Its original quota was 25,000 tonnes. The previous Government managed to persuade the Europeans to push that figure up, first to 40,00 tonnes, then, with a special increase, to 55,000 tonnes; but the Belize producers want the figure to increase to about 80,000 tonnes if they are to justify their investment. The Minister made generous reference to that, and it is not a point of difference between us. However, there is a difference in our arithmetic—there is not a gap of about 100,000 tonnes between existing production and the total quota. According to an answer given by the Parliamentary Secretary on 4 November 1997, the total volume of ACP imports into Europe in 1996 was 802,055 tonnes, which leaves a gap of only about 50,000 tonnes. If we assume that the figure for 1997 will be slightly higher, as the trend has been upwards over the years, the gap will be even smaller.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute the figure, but the figures that I was using were an average taken from 1994 to 1996. Many of the quotas and negotiations have been based on past production. The table for the EU banana market 1994-96 shows the grand total as some 3,839,000 tonnes, but a note at the bottom states that the origin of 78,000 tonnes of banana imports was not known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer that, but I am using the figures from a parliamentary question, which show that in 1992 the figure was 680,000 tonnes; in 1993 it had gone up to 748,000 tonnes; there was a slight dip in 1994 to 728,000 tonnes; the figure rose to 765,000 tonnes in 1995 and to 802,000 tonnes in 1996. That is a clear trend of increasing production in the ACP countries, particularly Belize, which justifies our great concern about whether the figure of 857,700 tonnes will be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition support the general approach of the proposals, and have no intention of trying to get in the way. We have grave concerns, however, as to whether the proposals will meet the needs of the World Trade Organisation, which, like it or not, we effectively have to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
follow. We are also anxious about whether they will meet the needs of the ACP countries—especially those of the former colonies and dependent territories, in the context of the United Kingdom. Banana production is crucial to their economic systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious about the level of aid that will be provided, about how it will be used and targeted, and about whether it will achieve the critical development in production and competitiveness to which the document refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of my hon. Friends have raised the issue of how the various ACP countries sort out who will export what. I accept from the Minister that it is perhaps not possible within the requirements of the WTO for the EU to stipulate individual quotas. Unless there is to be a total free-for-all among ACP producers, there must somehow be an arrangement—even if it is a gentleman's agreement—about who can produce what. If not this year, the countries will very soon be knocking at the ceiling of 857,700 tonnes, given the trend that I described. The question will then have to be faced of which countries and producers will be considered as having exceeded that 857,700 tonnes and will have to pay the required tariff levies. The matter is of particular concern to many countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition support in principle the path that is being taken. Clearly, it is right for the EU to respond to the WTO ruling. It should be recognised that, as the Minister said, the Americans have very much driven that result. Although he did not name names, the Minister also implied that countries in the European Union—especially Germany—take the same view, and are wholly opposed to support for ACP countries. It is right and proper that we recognise our responsibility to those countries, and that we support the general premise that they must be supported by preferential access and by direct aid to ensure that they become more competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that one of the Ministers will pick up my anxieties about aid, about where it will go and about how it will be targeted, and that the Government will ensure that some loose ends are tied up in their discussions with the rest of Europe. They should ensure that when the agreement comes back to the House—as it inevitably will in a few years' time—we can look back with pride and say that the system has helped countries to develop their economies and their ability to compete in the world banana market. Otherwise, there will be a huge increase in demand for aid in traditional, direct forms rather than for the development of production. I am sure that hon. Members would rather see the countries concerned develop their economies and stand on their own feet. I am anxious that such an increase in demand for aid may occur and that would not be in the countries' interests, or in the interest of UK and European taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond to my points, take forward the Opposition's concerns, and understand that we support the Government's approach to the need to look after Britain's former responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr. George Foulkes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like all previous speakers, I should like to say how pleased I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
am to be under your distinguished chairmanship, Mr. Maxton, with which I am especially familiar. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State said, this is my first time in a Standing Committee as a Minister, albeit in a supporting role. I have worn my presidency tie to celebrate the occasion. I hope that everyone will tell my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister that I have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful if I say a few words about matters that are the responsibility of the Department of International Development. My hon. Friend will deal with other points at the end of the debate. I want to deal with questions that members of the Committees have raised previously and with those that they have raised today. In particular, I want to deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, the Opposition spokesman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that the Government's top priority and overwhelming aim in this area since taking power has been to help our Commonwealth partners in the Caribbean. As hon. Members have said, the WTO ruling, not the European Union is creating the problem. I hope that no one is tempted to revert to type and to attack the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was being rather provocative. We are told from time to time that one of the big advantages of being in the European Union is that this country will wield greater clout as a member of a bigger community. The Committee will be disappointed if this country and its European partners are unable, in negotiations on these difficult questions, to stand up to big business interests in America or to whomever else obstructs progress towards helping our traditional friends in the Caribbean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is a well-known fisherman and taught me some skills. I am glad to see that people still rise to a bait when it is thrown out. I will deal with the hon. Gentleman's point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My presence in support of my hon. Friend the Minister of State demonstrates the importance that the Government attach to the issue right across Whitehall. I want to pay particular tribute to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which is in the lead on this matter. Its Ministers and officials have fought extremely hard in working groups and at the Council of Minsters. Particular appreciation was expressed in the Caribbean for the fact that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food took time out before the Agriculture Council at which this matter was discussed to go to St. Lucia to see for himself the problems and conditions that banana producers face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had two or three discussions about the issue with Caribbean high commissioners. I have also twice taken the opportunity to talk with Ministers from Caribbean countries. I have kept them informed about our actions and have, above all, listened to their concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister of State said, the Government support the principle of providing aid to traditional banana suppliers. We recognise that Caribbean
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
producers, in particular, will need as much assistance as possible to adjust to the new markets that will be created through compliance with the WTO ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, that we are talking about a European Commission proposal. The Committee's purpose is to discuss it and to give Ministers advice and guidance about the line that they should take. That is the purpose of the scrutiny procedure. In an explanatory memorandum, which I hope Opposition Members have read, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In particular the UK will want to broaden the scope of the proposed spending to focus on promoting long-term sustainable development. While spending on improving the competitiveness of the banana sector is likely to be important, in some cases spending on other areas such as diversification, or even in broader development activities, may provide a more effective and sustainable approach".</p></blockquote>
Those arguments are being put forward in working groups and at Council of Ministers' meetings and the Government hope that the scrutiny committee will endorse them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was dealing earlier with questions about the areas in which we think money should be spent, and he mentioned education. We believe that if we can put some of this money into education and training, particularly technical and vocational education, it is likely to be an important part of the diversification strategy, and increased employment across a whole range of sectors could be expected as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was mentioned earlier that the balance between the traditional ACP producers and the Latin American producers will change dramatically because of the WTO ruling. We do not believe that that will necessarily be so if we fight hard on all fronts on behalf of the Caribbean producers. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington spoke about the taste of Caribbean bananas. I was talking yesterday with representatives of the Caribbean Banana Exporters Association. They argued strongly that we should not simply say that British housewives should buy Caribbean bananas because they taste better, but out of customer and Commonwealth loyalty. We are saying that not just to customers but in discussions and meetings with large-scale retail representatives. We believe that they should recognise that over the past year Commonwealth producers have supplied bananas to the British consumer and that that should continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that there are problems connected with diversification. Some of the problems that apply to bananas apply to other crops as well. Regulate hurricanes can create havoc, as the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford knows very well. He has an intimate knowledge of the Caribbean and of bananas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowen Wells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertford and Stortford))</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And of hurricanes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hurricanes can create havoc, considering the high cost of production, low labour productivity, slope land, and so on. As my hon. Friend the Minister said earlier, we believe that there are opportunities for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
diversification, and he mentioned cut flowers and pot plants. Something that I find astonishing—I know that the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford has mentioned this before—is that all the tourist hostels and resorts in the Caribbean import food. All the food eaten by tourists in the Caribbean is imported. That is astonishing when the islands could, given their climate and conditions, grow much more themselves. The food sector and the agro-processing industry have huge growth potential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of imported food is not the responsibility of the islands. The people are sometimes characterised as too lazy to pick the oranges and limes off the trees, in fact, the chefs, who are generally European and American, are too lazy to process the local fruits and vegetables. They want them all pre-packed, filleted and frozen so that they do not have to do so much work in the kitchen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the reasons are many and various. I was not criticising the banana producers or their Governments, but this needs to be tackled by those Governments, and we should talk to them about it and give our help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is huge potential in developing tourism, which we want to support, as well as small-scale manufacturing, artisanal production, and so on. Those are all opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question whether we are giving such countries enough aid to help them in their difficult circumstances. The figure proposed is 366.8 million ecuthat is £243 million for hon. Members such as myself and the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill), who prefer figures to be stated in pounds rather than ecu. That is not Government policy, of course, and it is not because I am old Labour rather than new Labour. It is just because I can grasp more easily what we are talking about. In any event, is £243 million enough?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, there are Stabex funds that are undisbursed. More than 22 million ecu is due to be disbursed to Dominica, more than 37 million ecu is due to St. Lucia and more than 46 million ecu is due to St. Vincent. We are worried that that money has not been disbursed, and we have had discussions with the European Commission about speeding up the process. We are looking at ways of increasing the capacity of the Governments of the Windward Islands to be able to employ that money, so that it is used up as quickly as possible. More than 90 million ecu is available, but it is as yet unused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our office in the Caribbean is providing support to the OECS to improve public sector investment planning in the Caribbean. We have also recruited a social development adviser to identify Stabex initiatives that will tackle poverty. That adviser will work with the EC delegation in the Caribbean, which is in need of improvement. The money for that comes from the direct European Union budget rather than from the European development fund. There may, however, be some scope for reviewing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Baldry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain to the Committee how the European Community is going to fulfil its obligations under Lomé IV, and the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
implication for Lomé V? Does the judgment of the WTO mean that we should rip up Lomé as a whole, and that we can no longer give protection, help and assistance to those countries within the ACP towards which we feel that we have a duty of care?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was formerly the Minister responsible and I used to ask him similar questions. He knows, therefore, that renegotiation of Lomé is currently underway. We want and expect that to be completed during the period of the UK presidency. It will be discussed at next month's meeting of the General Affairs Council and at the Development Council in May. We aim to ensure that the interests of Caribbean producers, including banana producers, are taken account of in the Lomé discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred previously to European Union funds. As the hon. Member for Banbury knows, there is also substantial bilateral assistance to some Caribbean countries. The Windward Islands have also been among the principal beneficiaries of the Commonwealth debt initiative. We have wiped out a debt of £6.6 million for Dominica and a debt of £2.8 million for St. Lucia, and we are currently discussing a £3.6 million debt write-off with St. Vincent. When I visited Antigua I agreed a moratorium on debt repayments because of the work that the Antiguans are doing to help us with the situation in Montserrat. Grenada has been given a £3.3 million debt write-off, in Belize we are discussing a £14 million debt write-off and in Jamaica we have agreed the first stage of a debt write-off of £16.1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That all helps those countries' economies. They are receiving European Union assistance, Stabex funds that have not been used and should be used more effectively, bilateral assistance from the United Kingdom and debt write-off as part of the Commonwealth debt initiative. That is a great deal of assistance, and it demonstrates my Department's deep concern for the people of the Windward Islands. All the proposals are currently being discussed within the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, both I and my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food reaffirm our determination to fight in support of Caribbean banana producers. We recognise the difficulties that have been described, especially the WTO ruling. We understand the motivation behind that ruling and we regret the way in which Chiquita and Dole put pressure on the United State Government. We also recognise that we must work hard and argue powerfully in the Councils of the European Union to convince the interests in other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we will do everything that we can to protect the producers' position and to find a solution compatible with the WTO ruling. At the same time, we must give all possible assistance to restructuring and diversifying the banana industry, and to finding alternative employment. In so doing, the Government are fulfilling a promise and meeting our responsibility to banana producers, especially those in small Commonwealth Caribbean countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is common cause throughout the Committee and nothing divides us on this issue. I shall make a short speech because I do not want to repeat what other hon. Members have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for emphasising that our primary objective is, and always has been, to protect the interests of Caribbean Commonwealth colleagues. Unless we apply our collective political weight to the matter, I fear that there is a horrible inevitability about what will happen in the Caribbean. The economies of several smaller Commonwealth countries will decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has already been said that the United States, which has little immediate interest in bananas, has caused many of the problems. Most, if not all, of us are members of the Commonwealth Parly Association. As elected Members, we should consider how we can express our worries to elected members in the United States. Ministers undoubtedly do all that they can at a Government-to-Government level to express anxiety to members of the American Administration. We have all been to such meetings: there is usually a huge agenda of bilateral issues. Inevitably, the subject before us will end up on that agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the CPA attend its conferences, but what is the organisation's role? More than 25 per cent. of the CPA's members come from the Caribbean and the House needs to find a way of signalling to our colleagues there that we support them on this issue. We must also signal to United States legislators, who continue to bang on—as the current United States ambassador does—about a so-called special relationship with Britain, that such problems matter to us. They must realise that we are able to protect our Commonwealth colleagues in the Caribbean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The numbers of bananas coming from the Caribbean are tiny in comparison with imports from Ecuador, Colombia and other countries. Through the usual channels, Members of the House should consider how they can help Ministers in the Department for International Development, in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and in MAFF to communicate to the United States our view that banana imports is not a peripheral issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is important to the United Kingdom Parliament and we feel a considerable obligation to our colleagues in the Commonwealth. We are not prepared for the problem to be whittled away. Producers must not be pushed out of business and driven into poverty as their economies suffer. That would be a tragedy and a failure of Parliament to live up to the Commonwealth ideal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Diane Abbott 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute on a subject of such importance to the Caribbean and to those of Caribbean descent living in this country. Last autumn, I attended a meeting at Westminster central hall addressed by the Prime Ministers of St. Lucia, of Dominica, of Grenada and of St. Vincent, and by the high commissioner of Jamaica. The hall was packed with people of Caribbean origin exercised about the problem
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
of banana imports. The meeting was the first time that the Prime Ministers of the Windward Islands and of other territories had come together to address their nationals in this way and they were nervous because they thought that it might offend British Ministers and politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to convey the importance of the issue to the Committee The importance of bananas in the Caribbean economy cannot be stressed enough. Many smaller islands, such as St. Lucia and Dominica, are monocultures: their main crop is bananas. They are monocultures partly on the direction of Her Majesty's Government. The banana industry is a major source of foreign exchange to the Windwards. The foreign exchange that those countries earn from tourism is not clean. As the Minister said, 50 per cent. of every dollar earned in foreign exchange from tourism must be paid out for imports such as food. Banana agriculture provides clean foreign exchange that is invested directly in rural communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The banana industry plays a key role as an employer. A big problem in the Caribbean is the drift from the country to the towns of able-bodied, under-skilled young males who suffer disproportionately from unemployment—as they do across the western world. In Jamaica up to 50 per cent. of the population lives in the environs of Kingston. There are many unemployed, displaced young males, which creates attendant problems of crime and social exclusion. As a provider of jobs to unskilled rural males, the banana industry is more significant than its contribution to the GDP suggests. That is as true of Jamaica as it is of the Windwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said in the Committee about diversification. I will be blunt. If diversification is forced on the Caribbean region, that will not be into growing roses and lettuces but into the drug trade. My family comes from Jamaica; I go to the region every year, and I keep in contact with the politicians in the region, so I do not want to see the Caribbean countries go the way of Colombia, where the drugs trade and the vast sums of money associated with it destabilise civil society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes local politicians are too squeamish about spelling out that danger. If the island, the community and the villages are forced into diversification they will diversify into what is known in the Caribbean as ganja.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have talked about alternative forms of employment, tourism and retraining. Tourism and banana production involve different segments of the labour market. Young people who go happily into tourism are different from the middle-aged and young men working in the banana industry. Diversification for the segment of the labour market employed by the banana industry is not as easy as it might seem on paper. Some of the agricultural products suggested by Ministers, such as flowers, require a capital input for glasshouses, for chemicals and for fertilisers. Small rural producers will not have easy access to that capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there has been too much glib talk about diversification. We must recognise that diversification will take time. Perhaps a generational shift will be needed if civil society is to be preserved and the threat of the drug economy overtaking the islands is to be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
I want to stress the point made to the Committee about full, fair import arrangements for different territories. It would be tragic if the Windwards and Jamaica were squeezed out in favour of the Ivory coast and bigger producers. The Caribbean islands will never be as efficient as the vast south American plantations. People who know the islands know why that is so. Bananas are grown on hillsides and in deeply rural parishes as part of mixed agricultural production. Geographical and territorial limitations mean than banana growers in the Caribbean can never be as efficient or productive as the vast south American plantations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will say a word about the World Trade Organisation. We are all in favour of free trade: this country was built on it. The time will come when, in its deliberations, the World Trade Organisation will have to consider the question of good government and development. We must not allow the economies of little Caribbean territories to be smashed on the altar of free trade, especially if the alternative is mini Colombias growing up in the Caribbean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am working with Safeway, one of our major retailers, to develop a marketing strategy for Caribbean bananas and to identify them as a premium product—baby bananas—because that is part of the way forward. I cannot sufficiently stress the key role of banana production in the Caribbean. Not only does it make up a large proportion of gross domestic product; it is the mainstay of rural communities and villages. Nor can I stress enough the difficulties of diversification that local producers are sometimes shy to spell out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the operations of the WTO. Free trade is important; but free trade brought at the expense of living standards in regions such as the Caribbean, which will then throw themselves on us for aid, is bought at too high a price. Britain has an historic relationship with the Caribbean. As we approach the millennium, Caribbean politicians worry that Britain may be turning away from the Caribbean and turning towards Europe, and particularly to eastern Europe and Russia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain's historic relationship with the Caribbean is exemplified by the large Caribbean populations in most of our major cities. It is a connection that will not go away. I urge Ministers to honour that connection by continuing to press our case with vigour. They should consider seriously the problems of diversification, and make sure that banana production does not crash, which could lead to those rural communities being forced to turn to the drug economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.12 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate both Ministers for their display of determination and their enthusiasm to find a solution to a difficult problem. I do not doubt their sincerity, I thank them for their energy and I urge them on to still further efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer a few criticisms—but only to try to get a better settlement for the Caribbean that outlined in the paper before us. Europe's policy on bananas is practically a surrender to the World Trade Organisation. I ask Ministers to reconsider the advice that they receive from officials and lawyers on the meaning of the WTO ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
Officials of the WTO came before the Select Committee on International Development. The WTO official in charge of developing countries said that there was no reason under WTO rules why we could not protect developing countries by registering an agreement with the WTO—as we have done with the Lomé agreement. However, that depends on the will of the members of the WTO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That underlines the criticism, made by both sides of the Committee, that, in supporting the central American banana producers' objections, the United States of America has done a major disservice to tiny producers of bananas in the Caribbean. The USA has pushed a narrow technical point about non-allocation of quota within the total quota system, which was established in 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge the finding that B licences are part of that ruling. B licences do not discriminate between producers; they reward the exporters of ACP bananas with a licence, which they can sell. The licence allows the person who has it in his possession to import central American bananas. The beauty of that system is that the central American bananas are delivered to Europe at a much lower price than those of the ACP countries, hence the difference in selling price. The Caribbean producers—the Windward Islands, Jamaica and Belize—receive double the price received in central America. I challenge the lawyers who have advised Ministers and officials that that is a discriminatory system. I should like Ministers to examine that to destruction during the negotiations because such a system is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire has made the plea that a means must be found, even if by a gentleman's agreement or a management committee, to reinstate the system whereby a preferential price is paid to banana producers in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. The B-licence system took a long time to evolve. I remember helping the Windward Islands negotiate it before 1993. I want to explore to the death whether some such system is World Trade Organisation compatible. I do not accept that the current system should be simply wiped away, as suggested in the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we allow aid to replace the price that we now pay banana farmers in the Windward Islands, I fear that we will induce aid dependency, which must be avoided if at all possible. Even the money paid under the B-licence system for the benefit of farmers in the Windward Islands has not reached them. B-licence revenue has been used to buy a half share of Geest Bananas in Britain; the company no longer belongs to Geest plc; it belongs half to Fyffes and half to WIBDECO, the banana growers association of the Caribbean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that money—plus money from Geest Bananas' profits and dividends—is being used to repay capital with interest to the Allied Irish bank. That explains why production in the Windward Islands is expected to decrease from a peak of 280,000 tonnes to 140,000 tonnes this year. That reduction is undermining the viability of production in the Windward Islands. That is why we must be careful in fashioning any aid programme to ensure that aid reaches banana farmers.

In St. Lucia, the best bananas farmers are refusing to irrigate, fertilise or spray their bananas because they are not receiving the premium prices that they were promised, which are being paid by supermarkets in this country. The reasons for that are to do with St. Lucia's Byzantine political arrangements, which must be sorted out. We must not be seen to be giving large sums through the aid programme which do not help banana farmers produce better bananas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of Windward Islands bananas has increased hugely. All objective observers agree that it is now equivalent to that of any central American producer. I went there to see for myself, and I saw the boxes being unpacked by quality supervisors in Southampton on Monday. The bananas are of good quality. That great change is the result of tracing bananas from the fields of St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Dominica, Grenada and Belize all the way to the supermarket shelf in Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Tesco or Safeway. The banana farmers know those supermarkets' quality supervisors and regard themselves with pride as Sainsbury's or Waitrose producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of Caribbean bananas has increased greatly—it is now comparable to that of any central American producer. That is a huge achievement on the part of Caribbean banana farmers. We should now have no worries about quality. As my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) will remember, we used to have such worries, but we need not now. The banana farmer is capable of responding to signals from the marketplace if he receives them properly, but if he is not given the right price indicators and is not rewarded for his efforts, he will not produce the bananas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to what one may have thought from the rain on the Test match in Barbados, there is a serious drought at present in the Windward Islands. That hugely affects banana production. As most members of the Committee will know, a banana plant that is watered produces at least double, and sometimes up to three times, what it will produce if unwatered. We must overcome that production problem. If the Under-Secretary of State for International Development is to assist banana farmers, he must find ways of introducing irrigation, feeder roads, and quicker and better loading methods that do not scar the bananas during transportation. That is the way to help the banana farmer to realise his full potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small fanners should be joined together in co-operatives, which I know will appeal to the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is an advocate for and a member of co-operative societies in this country, and has always advocated them in relation to international development. In their present uncertain circumstances—they do not know whether the banana regime will continue at all—smaller farmers cannot afford the capital cost of equipment for irrigation, which they would expect to use over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years. If the Minister is to establish a system of economic aid that will assist those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
farmers, that issue must be addressed. Like the hon. member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, I do not think that we can sensibly suggest agricultural diversification. Most agricultural diversification efforts depend upon the regular shipments of bananas, which allow grapefruit, pineapples, avocado pears, coconuts and so on to be trans-shipped at economical cost. That applies also to Belize and Jamaica.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman continues with his argument, may I deal with the point that he raised a few moments ago? I want to be positive, not just because the hon. Gentleman is Chairman of the Select Committee and an old friend of mine, but because he has made some very good points about irrigation, feeder roads, loading arrangements and co-operatives. We have been considering those matters. The European Commission has provided a technical assistance team, because the Banana Growers Association has been slow to make proposals. That technical assistance team will help the association to devise proposals that will allow it to take up the money currently available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can also assure the hon. Gentleman that the Department will consider the specific proposals that he has made today in more detail and raise them with the European Commission; I will then come back to the hon. Gentleman about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply grateful to the Minister for that reassurance. I hope that that initiative will bear fruit, if that is the right phrase, in terms of bananas; I believe that it will. I do not want to discourage the Minister from adopting the other measures that he is proposing, because there are opportunities for the hotel industry—and, indeed, for local consumers—to use fruit, vegetables, fish and chickens produced in the islands. Such measures need to be supported, as does diversification into tourism, where possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, with the best will in the world, the black sand beaches of Dominica and the few beaches of St. Vincent will not produce much tourist income, unless the Minister proposes to build an airstrip for Boeing 747s, as ex-Prime Minister Dame Eugenia Charles of Dominica wanted to do. I doubt that the Minister's generosity will run to such a cost. Even then, I doubt whether Dominica can diversify into serious tourist income. Also, as the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, tourist income does not generate foreign exchange. Small-scale manufacture is possible; some excellent, high-quality textiles are being produced, which should be encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worry about the European Union's teams in the islands. I understand that there are four full-time professionals in each of the islands, plus a headquarters organisation. They produce rather theoretical, academic reports, which they have been trained to do, but they are not practical in assisting banana farmers to produce bananas. The Minister must tackle the structural organisation of the Banana Growers Association. I shall not go into too much detail because I may tread on too many toes, but the organisation must be tackled so that it efficiently encourages local banana producers to produce bananas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
However, even after doing all that, we shall still be unable to compete with central America. During negotiations, Ministers must draw attention to the question of unfair competition in central American countries. They may have the right geography, soil, drainage and water but they pay their workers a third of what they are paid in St. Lucia or Jamaica. The conditions under which bananas are produced in central America are scandalous and the Government should be extremely concerned about that. Producers are indulging in exploitation which undermines the concept of free trade on an equal basis. The Latin American countries must be made to provide decent conditions of service for their employees and should have to compete on equal terms with producers in the Windward Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that producers in west Africa are not west African companies. They include Del Monte, Dole and Chiquita; the subsidiary retailers in Germany, Holland and Sweden are also subsidiaries of Chiquita. Therefore, we are not talking about a level playing field—Chiquita and the big multinationals are playing their weight as hard as they can. The west African producers are more efficient; they have the land, the right geography and the water. They will take up the quota of 857,000 tonnes and exclude the Windward Islands and Jamaica, which cannot compete. Belize possibly can, provided it is given sufficient tonnage to produce. It needs a quota of not 80,000 tonnes but 100,000 tonnes to make the industry viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter must be fought in the most generous and determined fashion—as the Committee has done—to enable farmers to continue to produce a high quality product. They could reduce their costs considerably. Many of them could compete if an effort were made to produce an infrastructure—both human and physical—in the islands so that a viable and vigorous economy, which is based on agriculture, could continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow my hon. Friend with some trepidation, as he obviously has enormous experience and knowledge of the subject. I shall be brief as time is pressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a committed free trader all my life, I support the World Trade Organisation, but I acknowledge the unique circumstances in this case. There has been historical backing from all parties for the Lomé agreement. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington referred to the Caribbeans's extraordinary dependency on one crop, which is demonstrated clearly in the annex: 17 per cent. of GDP—half the export earnings of Dominica and St.Vincent—is a unique and remarkable figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all shown loyalty to free trade in the past but on this occasion the circumstances are exceptional and I entirely endorse the hon. Lady's comments that should the banana industry cave in, there would be no option of switching to pot plants, lettuce or whatever. The example of central America is horribly close and it is likely that the producers would move into drugs, which would be bad for the island and for the rest of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that background and the WTO ruling, I hope that we can analyse what is wrong with the proposals, which have some real defects, but we are short of time. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
Americans have been knocked and I understand that the Government must be under tremendous pressure from Germany. I spent some time in Germany and I recall reading frequent articles in the German newspapers about the country's huge consumption of bananas. As Austria assumes the presidency of the European union after us, I hope that our two Ministers here—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then Germany.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, then Germany. Can we nail this down? Germany is not interested in little islands with which one of its European partners has links going back 400 years: it simply wants cheaper bananas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had direct experience of tariff quotas for leather in Japan. The original quota system's aim there was different—to keep out all leather from other countries in order to enable the Japanese to build up a completely new industry after the second world war. The first regime was a quota regime, but no figure was ever provided by the Japanese Government, so finding it out was rather like trying to grapple with a black greased pig in the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We eventually managed to negotiate an improved tariff quota system in which the quantities were published but the means by which the quotas were divided were not. It is crucial for our two Ministers to get across in the negotiations that the means by which the ACP quota is carved up must be transparent. It must be made absolutely clear how it is to be divided, who is responsible for it and how it can be amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard eloquent comments on the advantages of south America including its deeper soil, better temperatures, more rainfall and better port facilities, with ships arriving every day to take the bananas away. The infrastructure is much Metter so it has huge advantages. However, the ACP countries are not homogeneous. The figures show a huge difference between the Ivory Coast and Cameroon—each produces 155,000 tonnes—and St. Lucia, which produces 127,000 tonnes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be dividing ACP countries against the rest but considering how to help the Caribbean islands, with which we have traditional contacts. We are all agreed about the inefficiencies there, which result from the soil, the mountains, ships not arriving every day and from hurricanes—a national disaster that has not yet been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their negotiations, Ministers should not regard the ACP countries as a bloc because of the real danger that more efficient African countries within the ACP—not our traditional dependants—may gain help from their old mother countries such as France and squeeze out those that we are most worried about when the quota is divided. That is why it is fundamental to know precisely how the quota is to be carved up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An auction system could be the most dangerous for the producers that we are trying to help. Will the EU or a group of European importers be responsible for it? That is the most fundamental question and I beg the Minister not to sign the agreement until it is absolutely clear. As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Hertford and Stortford said, we are handing away some very good cards. The B-licence system provided real advantages to our dependants as indeed did the hurricane licence.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
When an island was devastated, the hurricane licence gave islanders a chance to bring in bananas from elsewhere and keep the cash flow moving while damage to plantations and fields was repaired. That has gone completely. If we are going to sell the pass on the B licence and the hurricane licences, we must make sure that what replaces them safeguards our people. Otherwise, the whole exercise will be nonsense and we might as well just have straightforward free trade and let producers go to the wall. I am concerned that there are real weaknesses in our approach because we know so little of the detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.36 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be repetitive, but I am grateful to all hon. Members who have spoken. The debate has been useful for me and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development. We shall certainly take on board the criticism—and the spirit in which it was made—that there is still much to be done in the negotiations. We do not see an alternative to the Commission's proposals. There will be no quick fix.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford mentioned the use made of B licence money, and I will look into that and write to him and other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the WTO outlawing B licences. Perhaps I explained this inadequately, but B licences were ruled to be discriminatory because they provide traders with an incentive to handle ACP bananas rather than dollar bananas. Most of the B licences go to EU and ACP companies rather than to US and Latin American companies. I will have the issue and, in particular, the use of B licence money double-checked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not want to interrupt the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire while he was speaking, but I have re-read the list in front of me and there is a possible divergence in the figures. I have, indeed, had it confirmed that there is a 100,000 tonne gap. I have referred to two figures. The traditional ACP—I am using the figures for the 1994–96 average—does not include the Dominican Republic, which produces 74,000 tonnes. The parliamentary answer that the hon. Gentleman mentioned refers to the total ACP figure, which includes the Dominican Republic. If we take out the Dominican Republic, there is a 100,000 tonne gap below the new quota of 857,000 tonnes. The addition of the Dominican Republic causes the difference between the traditional and total ACP figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister be clearer? Why is he excluding the Dominican Republic? Either it is an ACP country to which we have obligations under Lomé or it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is an ACP country, but not a traditional one. Different rules apply to the Dominican Republic. They date from when the original agreements were made, which might have been during the previous presidency. I cannot find them now, but I will write to the hon. Gentleman about them. They apply simply because of the way in which production in the Dominican
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
Republic came into being. The Dominican Republic is separated out and is not considered to be a traditional ACP country. It is, however an ACP country by definition. We are, therefore, dealing with two sets of figures—the parliamentary answer figures and the new quota figure, which will be 857,000 tonnes for traditional ACP countries. Some 100,000 tonnes are still spare, which smaller countries, such as the Windward Islands and the other countries to which we have referred, can take up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point was made about—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>— </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can just answer the first point because it might assist the hon. Gentleman. We have heard the recurring point about how the new quota will be carved up so that the big ones do not put the little ones out of business and it is not incompatible with the World Trade Organisation. According to the Commission's analysis, the new unallocated quota of 857,000 tonnes is the only way of preserving some guarantee of access to the European market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested this morning that the more competitive ACP suppliers might exercise some form of self-restraint. If the 100,000 gap was filled and the quota came under pressure, the suppliers who were furthest below their current individual ceilings would be given priority on the EU market. That is a matter for the European Union and for our own mechanism; no doubt we will have to negotiate on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention is to be helpful—using a stick and a carrot—to our friends in the Caribbean. We do not want to allow one of them, who might want to run ahead with the unallocated quota, to take production from smaller islands. We intend that those who are farthest below their individual current ceilings be given priority in the EU market. I hope that that can be negotiated without us coming under attack from the World Trade Organisation. It is a way of dealing with the fear about unallocated quota, which we have in order to meet the WTO ruling that we should not have specific quotas for individual countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come—more successfully, I hope—to the other matter raised by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. There are 12 traditional suppliers with a long history of supplying bananas to member states. The Dominican Republic acceded to Lomé in 1989. It is not a traditional supplier, so it is not covered by the banana protocol of the fourth Lomé convention. That is why it is separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we have such debates, and particularly when we are negotiating, we need to know exactly what figures we are talking about, especially as we get closer to the limit of the 100,000 tonne gap. It is important that all hon. Members who have an interest in this issue know the exact figures. As was said by the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry)—a former Minister at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foods and at the Foreign Office—the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association probably has a role to play.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears from what the Minister is saying that the Dominican tonnage production is excluded from the figures that he gave us. One must therefore conclude that it is excluded from the 857,700 tonnes that will be the new quota.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister confirms that. Presumably that means that the Dominican Republic will be classified within the 2.2 million tonnes plus the extra 300,000 tonnes of dollar bananas—will he confirm that? If I am correct in saying that the Dominican tonnage will not be part of the 857,700 tonnes, I suggest that the Minister revisits the parliamentary answer from which I have been quoting, which clearly lists Dominica as one of the 12 traditional suppliers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is Dominica.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I accept his point. Will he confirm that the Dominican Republic's tonnage will not be within the 857,700 tonnes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I freely admit that late on Monday night when I was reading all the brief, I had to get my atlas. I have never visited the Caribbean, although many of my constituents come from there. I thought, "Someone will stand up and ask me to name the Windward Islands, so I had better find out where they are." I read the briefings and thought, "Hang on, there are two Dominicas." There is Dominica in the Windward Islands and the Dominican Republic. The one that is traditional is Dominica in the Windward Islands, which are also made up of Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent. The Dominican Republic is ACP, but not traditional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
I will give the average figures for their supply of the European market so that they are consistent with the other figures I have used. The 1994–96 average supply from the Dominican Republic was 74,102 tonnes, or 2 per cent. Dominica, in the Windward Islands, supplied only 38,422 tonnes, or 1 per cent.—only half as much. One of those countries is included and the other is not. If I have not clarified that, I will write to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and other members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I re-emphasise that it is the priority of the presidency to conclude the matter before the end of June as satisfactorily as possible for our Caribbean friends and our European Union partners. That is in everybody's interests. It is in the interest of good governance of the EU that we do not ask Austria to conclude the negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 5357/98, a draft Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No. 404/93 on the common organisation of the market in bananas and a draft Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate with countries having a substantial interest in the supply of bananas to the EU, and European Community Document No. 6150/98, a draft Regulation establishing a special framework of assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas; and supports the Government's position that these proposals together represent a serious attempt to meet the EU's international obligations under the WTO and the Lomé Convention, that revised arrangements must take full account of the interests of those Caribbearr countries which have traditionally supplied the UK with bananas and that aid to the Caribbean Commonwealth producers has an important part to play in assisting general adaptation to more competitive market conditions.</p></blockquote></p>
