	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning to you, Dr. Clark, and to my fellow members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the opportunity to debate the European Commission's proposed social action programme for the three-year period from 1998 to 2000. I look forward to a constructive discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was privileged to speak for the Opposition when, in November 1995, this Committee debated the previous programme for 1995 to 1997. However, I should say that it is much better to speak as a member of the Government. Those of us who are veterans of the 1995 debate will remember that I spoke then about the United Kingdom's dismal employment record, about the lack of investment in training and the lack of decent minimum standards in the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has changed since then. We have signed the social chapter, and we are implementing four directives under it. We have also implemented the working time and young workers directives. Moreover, we are introducing legislation on fairness at work to fulfil our manifesto commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The social action programme, which will in effect, run for two and a half years, and which reflects the UK's influence and input, sets out a framework for the Commission's proposed actions. The programme was introduced to the Social Affairs Council by the Commission on 4 June; the Council subsequently debated the matter on 27 October and at Pôrtschach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council's role is not to endorse the programme per se; and it did not do so. The Council will, of course, give full and proper consideration to those actions that require decisions as and when the Commission makes specific proposals, considering each proposal on its merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have ample time and opportunity to discuss some of the issues, and I shall be glad to do so. However, it is important to put this debate and the social action programme in context. There are 18 million people employed in Europe. That is why the issue of jobs is at the forefront of the European
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
agenda, as the social action programme correctly recognises, and why the European Union is acting to remedy this appalling tragedy by developing new employment strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In June 1997, we began to see real change at the Amsterdam European Council, where a new employment chapter for the EU treaty was agreed and, quite remarkably, given immediate effect. That text emphasises the need for modern work forces and flexible labour markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of 1997, after the special Luxembourg jobs summit, the Council agreed a set of detailed employment guidelines to be followed by member states when implementing employment policy, under the four main themes of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities. Those pillars are a result of the major influence of the UK Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the end of April this year, all member states had submitted national employment action plans that describe how each country implements the guidelines. This country was the first to submit such a plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cardiff European Council, which the Prime Minister chaired in June, and which rounded off the UK presidency, acknowledged the contribution made by the action plans and agreed those areas where further work is needed under the four pillars. The agreement on employment guidelines for 1999 will reflect that agenda, and will be a key task for our Austrian friends during the remainder of their presidency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the backdrop against which the Commission has produced its new programme, and against which we shall judge it. Do the proposed measures promote employability or enhance adaptability? Do they encourage entrepreneurship or provide greater equality of opportunity? Will they lead to more flexible labour markets? Will they enhance competitiveness and job creation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three main themes of the programme—jobs, skills and mobility; the changing world of work; and an inclusive society—suggest that the Commission has broadly recognised those imperatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, the Government commend a great deal of the programme, much of which sits foursquare with our policies. However, we shall not be able to support some of the Commission's actions, either because of a proposal's substance or because it offends against subsidiarity. One such measure relates to the provision of information and the consultation of workers at national level. UNICE decided on 16 October not to enter negotiations with the European Trades Union Congress about a possible agreement. We, therefore, expect the Commission to propose a directive. I noted in my memorandum that a proposal on healthcare may also offend against subsidiarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme simply sets a framework. We will form a clearer view and seek to influence decisions when issues are clarified. For example, the Commission is and will be discussing specific issues with the social partners, as provided for under the social chapter, before deciding whether to proceed. My ministerial colleagues in other Departments and I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
will come back to the Committee over the next two years or so with memorandums on specific proposals. In the meantime, I am happy to hear the Committee's views, to respond to questions and, when appropriate, to put the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am to put questions to the Minister. I hope that they will be brief and will be put one at a time, because there is enough time to allow all members of the Committee to ask more than one question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Dr. Clark, to the Chair. I believe that this is my maiden appearance before you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his helpful and encouraging opening remarks. Will he say a little more about what might loosely be called the political scene at the time of the June Social Affairs Council and thereafter? He will no doubt claim that there has been a sea change in German politics. What is the consensus for change and social action at a European level? Given that he has been a little coy in his explanatory memorandum, which contains no specific proposals, what is the likely cost of the policies to member states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his questions. I did not realise that this was his first appearance in this Committee as the Opposition's spokesman with you, Dr. Clark, in the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman rather coyly said that little information has been provided. I said at the outset that we are discussing the four key principles of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities. During the two and a half years of the social action programme, we shall bring specific issues before the Committee for consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent meeting of the Social Affairs Council revealed that work is the key to the common cause. Jobs, employability and investment in education and training are necessary to move people from the margins of society into the mainstream. We need equal opportunities and adaptability, which are part of the process to provide skills and training. Those who already have skills need to learn how to adapt them to meet the changing needs of the marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was general agreement on labour market flexibility based on skill content and partnership in the workplace to meet the demands of a modern economy. We need to be more competitive in Europe and to tackle structural unemployment. There is a common purpose, which is why the Amsterdam and Cardiff summits were so successful. For the first time in Europe, we have an agreement on social action plans for each member state, which will allow us to judge whether they are reaching the criterion of increasing employment within the European Union. The message is positive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister that there is much in the document to be commended and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
supported. He referred to subsidiarity and identified two areas of concern. Under the heading "Subsidiarity", the explanatory memorandum says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The UK will scrutinise individual proposals".</p></blockquote>
The Commissions's document raises issues that will clearly have an impact on subsidiarity, which is a very important issue. Would it not therefore be better for the Government to clarify that matter at the outset as a matter of principle rather than to wait for detailed proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that question. That is precisely what the Government have done. We have clearly set out our objectives in debates in the Social Affairs Council and in Council meetings, which were agreed by member states. We need to decide whether the proposals are consistent with subsidiarity, and whether they will have a negative or a positive effect on jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the current proposals about information and consultation and health matters offend against subsidiarity. We made it clear to our partners that we—and, by the way, several other member states—oppose the proposals about information and consultation. Our position on subsidiarity is clear. From day one of our Administration, we have advanced proposals that do not offend against subsidiarity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement. I am especially concerned about unemployment in Europe, which has a bearing on our ability to sustain the elderly population, which is increasing. Does the Minister agree that energy should be focused on creating more jobs, so that Europe and, especially, Britain are better able to sustain their elderly populations in comfortable retirement? Does he also agree that it would be sensible to try to generate employment among the early middle-aged who are forced to retire early—and who call themselves early retirees although they are in fact unemployed—among whom there is a wealth of talent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that you, Dr. Clark, and I are probably in the foothills of middle age, so we should have some sympathy with the principles that lie behind my hon. Friend's question. I think that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) is also in the foothills of middle age, although one sometimes feels much older when one is in opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked about the Government's intentions about employment. Our welfare-to-work programme is the most ambitious of any Government in Europe. The new deal for young people involves £2.6 billion, the new deal for the long-term unemployed involves £480 million, the new deal for lone parents involves £190 million—alongside which £40 million is available for child care—the new deal for people with disabilities involves £200 million, the new deal for the partners of the unemployed involves £60 million and the new deal for schools will put £1.3 billion into the education and training programme. The Government are making a huge financial investment, and the structure of the new deal is vital. We will tackle structural unemployment and problems
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
affecting the long-term unemployed, young people, those with caring responsibilities and those with disabilities that prevent them from gaining access to or retaining a position in the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's position is absolutely clear. Resources are available, investments have been made and the right structure is in place. I am pleased to say that our approach has the overwhelming support of private and public sector employers, who want to ensure that our programme works. I am certain that, as the programme develops, it will have a major impact on structural unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Geraldine Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morecambe and Lunesdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that high employment levels are the gateway to building an inclusive society in this country and throughout Europe, and that raising the skills base through readily available, high-quality training is the key to expanding employment opportunities? What measures will be incorporated in the social action plans to provide high-quality training and to raise the skills base?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that question. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), our new deal will improve employability. In relation to the gateway, people who have been unemployed for a considerable time—including those with special needs—will be given the opportunity to train for work before they return to it. We have also discussed entrepreneurship programmes, which will help people to get back into the labour market through self-employment. That will ensure that workers who have redundant skills will have the capacity to acquire new skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A range of highly skilled middle-aged men live in my area, which is a former mining community, but their skills do not necessarily satisfy the needs of the new opportunities in the labour market. Therefore, the new deal at the micro level—as well as at the macro level—must provide new adaptable skills for those outside the labour market who were previously skilled workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equal opportunities are increasingly important for people with disabilities and those—women in particular—who have caring responsibilities. The Government's message is that we take the jobs programme across Europe, and our contribution to it, very seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already helpfully provided some information on subsidiarity, and on one or two cases where he feels that that principle should be invoked. Will he tell the Committee if there are any areas of interest covered by the document to which subsidiarity should not apply? How many areas of interest covered by the document are properly for determination at Community level? Also, if employment action plans are to be determined by member states, what sanctions or other pressure would be applied to those states that have plans that do not come up to scratch? Will those states have to sharpen up their act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
The purpose of a co-ordinated approach across Europe was to bring fresh impetus for action by member states. Instead of just talking about programmes for the unemployed, for those with disabilities and for those on the margins of society, each member state must take responsibility within its economy for a direct and positive input into job creation, training and education opportunities, and lifelong learning in the workplace. The proposals, as they progressed from Amsterdam to Cardiff, were intended to give responsibility to member states to propose action plans to tackle the problem of Europe's 18 million unemployed people, half of whom have been unemployed for more than a year. The proposals, therefore, had a real bite, and I am pleased to say that, by the time of the Cardiff summit, every member state met its responsibility to present an action plan. Those plans will provide accountability and will enable judgments to be made across Europe on which objectives have been reached. They will also allow the electorates and the unemployed people of individual member states to know what responsibility the state will take to ensure that job, education and training opportunities are provided over a period of time, and what the role of the private and public sectors will be in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's role, which is defined by the treaty, is to propose a programme. That programme will be discussed and debated—as we are doing today—by member states. The specific aspects of each part of the programme will be discussed in the future, but this morning we are setting out the framework. As we work through the programme, dialogue and debate on specific issues will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On subsidiarity, I have made clear the two issues about which we have concerns. Aside from that, I have indicated that the general thrust of the programme is along the lines of the Government's strategic approach. I am happy to rest on that point, given that I have made an absolute commitment to debate any specific proposals with hon. Members at each stage of the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission's proposals stress the need to promote equality of opportunity under article 13—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend, but I did not hear the start of his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Commission is provoking debate on equality of opportunity under article 13. As Britain has a good deal of experience of legislation and practice in that area, will we play an active role in contributing to that debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Equal opportunities are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment. Indeed, equal opportunities are one of the four pillars of the social action programme that we support. In addition, we have already put out to consultation proposals on ageism in the workplace to see how we can bring about good practice, and we have accepted and will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
implement proposals by April 2001 on the burden of proof in sex discrimination and equal opportunities cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government encourage equal opportunities and good practice in the workplace wherever they can. I am pleased to say that the overwhelming majority of employers, irrespective of the size of their businesses, recognise the absolute necessity to have broad-based equal opportunities policies in this new world of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Cotter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Weston-super-Mare)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to take the Minister back to the issue of the skilled middle-aged work force. He spoke about the new deal in that connection. Many people are concerned about manufacturing and about the skills of people in manufacturing, especially middle-aged men. There has long been a need to raise the status of people who are engaged in manufacturing, to continue retraining and to address the serious problem of the decline in manufacturing industry. There is a risk that a large number of middle-aged people will be thrown on the scrap heap. That requires more than just talking about the new deal, and I should like the Minister to think about the issue a little more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two parts to that question. The first relates to the economy, and I shall return to that subject. The second is a strategic question about how we should enhance the role of the sciences and engineering skills, and how we can encourage an increasing number of people in schools, colleges and university to participate, following their full-time or part-time education, in those skill and knowledge-based parts of the economy. In Britain, we are very good at creating ideas through pure science, but we are not so good at putting them into production in the marketplace. We have a skills gap. During the past year, one in three workers in Britain did not receive a single minute's training from their employers. It is not possible to compete in a global marketplace if one third of the work force receives no consistent training—whether it is up-skilling or anything else—so we must invest in training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must change the culture by working with British industry. For example, British Aerospace—other companies are also involved—is working with primary and secondary schools and colleges, linking the local school community with the local labour market, to develop skills from knowledge based on the curriculum and to give young people leaving schools and colleges opportunities in the manufacturing sector so as to enhance engineering in particular. I take on board the thrust of the question of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter), and the Government are keen to ensure that his concerns are met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of his question alluded to the economy. He asked whether manufacturing is still an effective part of the economy: it is, will continue to be and needs to be. We must be careful not to talk down the situation to the point where we talk ourselves into a recession. I know that some Opposition Members will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
talk the country down until the cows come home, because it is their only way back into power. However, the fact is that manufacturing output is rising. The latest figures show that it rose in the first three quarters of the year. Manufacturing exports have risen by more than 2 per cent. That is a major triumph for the UK at a time when a quarter of the global economy is in recession. In some economies in the middle east and far east, exports have fallen by 50 per cent. or 60 per cent., but we have still been able to increase manufacturing exports. That is a tremendous success. It was said that the sharpest fall has been in business optimism, but manufacturing output has risen, not fallen, during 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Government came to power, 400,000 jobs have been created—184,000 have been created since January—and unemployment has fallen by more than 300,000. As well as problems relating to the international economy, the Government have had to tackle the mess left by the previous regime and we are working through that. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made clear yesterday, the economy has not gone into recession, and we shall ensure that it does not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to consider the meaning of recession. During the previous recession, manufacturing output fell by 13 per cent., investment fell by more than 16 per cent., interest rates peaked at 17 per cent., unemployment rose continuously for seven years towards 3 million, manufacturing employment fell by 10 per cent., mortgage rates rose to more than 13 per cent. and a business went bust every three minutes. That was recession. No one, whatever his political colour or hue and whether in industry or commerce, could describe Britain as being anywhere near the level of recession experienced when the previous Government were in power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's statement, in which he referred to the Amsterdam treaty. It is clear that employment policy and job creation are now at the heart of European social policy. Will my hon. Friend say more about that and the role played by the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his question. From the outset, the Government made it clear that we would try to change the direction in Europe by encouraging our colleagues to examine fundamentally the way in which the European economy works and to accept the need for significantly increased investment in jobs, skills, technology and training, with a better link between industry, education and science. The Government signed the social chapter as a new regime in which social policy is discussed and tenets are questioned—for example, does the social policy have a positive or negative effect on employment, is that effect assessed when restructuring the labour market, does it deal with social inclusion, does it provide fairness in the workplace and foster partnership to give each enterprise a more competitive edge in its activities nationally and internationally? I am pleased to say, without boasting, that Europe now has a clearer set of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
objectives on how to tackle existing problems. That is due largely to the fact that, from the outset, the Government wanted a positive and continuing dialogue with our European colleagues, unlike the position we inherited in which no one spoke to the United Kingdom because it was not interested in proper dialogue and debate. That has changed significantly and we shall see the benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I alone in the Committee in being astonished that neither the social action programme 1998–2000 nor the Minister in his opening comments referred to the global crisis following the Asian crash? Has not that phenomenon totally transformed our economic prospects by making it infinitely harder for our manufactured exports to be sold in Asian markets? Those countries have experienced a dramatic drop in domestic demand and a depreciation of their currencies. Their economic efforts are increasingly being directed at exports, especially to European markets? Can the European social model, which is long on worthy platitudes and aspirations but short on hard economic realities, really be sustained?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a sense of deja vu with the hon. Gentleman's question. I think that I had a similar question in the last Committee—the only difference now is that he has tweaked it a bit with a reference to world financial difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As those difficulties started to unravel—first in Korea, then in other parts of the Far East economy, Japan and Russia—the Government's leadership in the G8 and their international action helped to establish a common purpose in dealing with risk factors in the world economy. As a consequence, on 13 October the International Monetary Fund and the World bank agreed on a process of co-ordinated action to ensure that we dealt with the issues at an international level in a way that would assist the world economy to get out of recession. At the same time, the European economies and the American economy, in particular, continued their strategy of investment in training, education, science and research and development bases. Alongside that, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced yesterday, the Government will continue their investment programme in education, training and the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the basis on which we will see our way through the problems, which are of an international scale. Those problems would be twofold at least were it not for the fact that we have a common approach in Europe to tackling structural unemployment and social exclusion. Whether the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) is in favour of being in Europe or not is not relevant. Unless everyone co-operates in the global economy, there will be no benefits for any of us. We need co-operation to ensure that world trade and social policy are sustained and that we sustain economies in such a way that we have continued growth. In that way, we will not fall headlong into recession, with huge numbers of people unemployed and instability in the political institutions
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
of many of the countries that we want to see develop new democratic institutions and join the world family of modern, effective democratic states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that industry has to undertake a complete transformation in the next 20 years? At the moment, we lead in the knowledge-based, technology-based, and research-based sectors—sectors in which we can be competitive in the long term. We have to move our industry more into those sectors. In that regard, we probably have something in common with France and Germany. Does my hon. Friend the Minister believe that the European Union has recognised the scale of the challenge that faces us and the fact that it can contribute effectively through the action programme to that transformation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's question has hit the issue on the button. If we and the European Union had not realised the scale of the challenge before, we are realising it now. At the Confederation of British Industry conference this week, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry set out the Government's strategy for the knowledge-based economy. Later this year, we shall publish a competitiveness White Paper, which will take the matter even further and set out the Government's objectives. The most important factor about the White Paper is that it has been written together with industry. The Government have not been sitting in an ivory tower in Victoria Street saying, "This is what industry needs and these are our ideas." The White Paper is the result of a partnership; it is the first time that a Government have sat down with industry and said, in the spirit of partnership, "Let's set out the objectives for reaching the new economy. How do we achieve that? How do we co-ordinate our action? What is the Government's responsibility? What are the responsibilities of companies and sectors? What is the research and development responsibility?" The competitiveness White Paper will be one of the most far-reaching pieces of policy that any Government has published. It will be welcomed by industry and commentators alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alongside that White Paper is the need to gain two things. One is inward investment, and we need to get second and third-generation investment. That is the ball game that the Government are now in. We have attracted substantial levels of inward investment in the past few years, and that has continued at record levels. We now have to turn that first-generation inward investment into second and third-generation inward investment. We have to link R and D—pure research—with the productive cycle. That means putting inward investment companies in partnership with the research and university base. We should start from a pure science base, with newly invented products branded as UK inventions before they are put into the marketplace. That is something that this country has not been very good at in the past.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
The Government take those processes very seriously. We appreciate the importance of the point that the hon. Gentleman raised, as do our European colleagues. Over the next 10 years, in conjunction with those colleagues, we shall transform the European economy on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I begin by saying that it is not his fault that he has had to fall back on a series of party political broadcasts. The document is very vague and does not lend itself to the sort of debate that members of the Committee want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 6 of the document states that the Commission will
	<br><blockquote><p>"continue to promote the development of innovative forms of job creation through local development measures, including territorial employment pacts and the social economy".</p></blockquote>
What are "local development measures", "territorial employment pacts" and the "social economy", and why is the Commission involved in any of them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman does not understand any of that, he should realise. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Members should listen for a change. The previous Government failed to do anything that impacted upon European policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The macro-economy is not the only issue; micro-economic policy—the development structure within local economies—is also important. Large parts of Europe, including the UK, have regional and sub-regional local economies that have suffered from the impact of industrial and labour market change. Consequently, we must co-ordinate action across the public and private sectors. We must deal with infrastructure change—how we invest in infrastructure to deal with derelict or contaminated land or with transportation issues. We must bring together land use and investment and deal with the problem of people who are socially excluded because of long-term unemployment or a lack of a skill base in the local economy to track new job opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair to the previous Conservative Government, the establishment of the training and enterprise councils formed a kernel in the interaction between the public and private sectors at a local labour market level. The creation of the TECs received full support from the Labour party. We must try to ensure the participation of TECs as vibrant and viable vehicles for the co-operation of the public and private sectors at a local labour market level, with the aim of regenerating local economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regeneration budgets allow the Government to work with local authority investment plans that put forward joint public and private sector strategies for investment and new job opportunities in both the manufacturing and service sectors. In many badly affected areas, that strategy has facilitated the levering in of tens of millions of additional financial and investment resources, resulting in new jobs, new infrastructure and new land uses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
The Government's contribution to that process has included the establishment of regional development agencies—powerhouses of which the focal point will be the private business sector. We have also just completed a review of the coalfield communities and are co-ordinating our actions across Departments to tackle the large-scale devastation of such communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Objectives 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the European strategy address investment in local economies throughout Europe and the regional strategies that are required to tackle unemployment, social deprivation, lack of investment and lack of infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) does not understand that process, that is his problem. Thank goodness the Government know what they are doing, and are taking the proposals forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme is about job creation and about investing in education, in infrastructure and in the culture of entrepreneurship. The resources being put into objective 1, in Merseyside, for example, will effect a transformation. For the first time in decades, new small and medium enterprises are being created, along with the development of supply chains to larger companies, new products and goods and services to larger manufacturers and companies in the regions. Such developments are critical for the regeneration of our regional and sub-regional economies. The Government are committed to ensuring that the programme works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that, when in opposition, we could have asked the same question as Opposition Members now ask about the relevance of Commission involvement? For example, when in government, they transferred responsibility for health and safety issues to the Commission. We do not need lessons from the Opposition on such matters. That said, does my hon. Friend believe that, in order to meet the laudable objectives laid down in the social action programme, more Commission-inspired coordination of social security systems is necessary, as implied in the document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it absolutely clear at the outset that the Government see that as a subsidiarity issue and continue to do so. Although we have not yet received a full set of proposals from the Commission, we are clear that it is a question of subsidiarity and will remain so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister fill us in on the implications for the enlargement of the Community? First, the document refers to the work of the European social fund, but, as he will know, the funds must be restructured in connection with financing the enlargement programme. Secondly, what is his attitude to minimum standards in employment law in connection with the low standards that typically apply in African states? Will they be able to meet the required standard without having to shed large chunks of competitiveness and lose employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter of enlargement goes wider than the hon. Gentleman suggests; it is the subject of complex discussions. The European Community has for some time offered support in various guises to those seeking ultimately to become members of the Community. Those countries are at different stages in their applications for membership. We want to ensure their gradual involvement in social policy programmes and activities, especially in employment strategy and in the promotion of social and civil dialogue, which are essential pillars of the programme. It will continue to be important to encourage those countries gradually to upgrade those various activities and to encourage investment in the infrastructure—in jobs, training, employment and inward investment. It is a continuing dialogue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a recent Social Affairs Council meeting that I attended—the one before last—long and positive discussions were held with the countries seeking membership of the European Community about their interests and involvement. In addition, member states have differing interests in the various nations seeking membership in the first wave, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, and our colleagues in eastern and central Europe have specific problems, which must be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an ongoing dialogue; it has not yet been completed. In the process of implementing key parts of the social programme, I am sure that we shall look to our colleagues outside the Community for a gradual process of investing in those countries' social, economic, educational and health structures; and, where possible, the Community will assist with that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following up on the question of the hon. Member for West Dorset, I believe that when the document refers to territorial employment tax, there is a translation problem. It is what we would normally call regional, but that has a specific meaning in Europe. For instance, it refers to the East German economic problems and the fact that the whole region has problems with the exchange rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to local development measures, which the hon. Gentleman also queried, did not the previous Government somewhat embarrass Britain by turning down Community help in cases in which a degree of matching funding was needed from Britain, on the ground that local development help distorted the economy? Should we not welcome initiatives for local development as a way of involving the economy of Europe as a whole?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that question. The previous Government got themselves into an ideological cul-de-sac regarding resources such as the RECHAR fund, which made funds available for our coalfield and steel communities. It meant that those communities lost investment projects worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Programmes for restructuring the local labour market were lost and investment in infrastructure was lost. Programmes to refurbish contaminated land invested in by the Department of the Environment had to be abandoned
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
because there were no matching funds. We were in a diabolical position because of the Conservative Government's intellectual dislike of Europe and all things European. United Kingdom taxpayers had paid into the funds but were not receiving the benefits of the resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to say that, after years of prevarication, the previous Government were forced into doing something about this. But we lost hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in local economies which badly needed it, and many communities are still suffering from the effects of such losses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to the assertion in the penultimate paragraph of page 2 that economic and monetary union will contribute to
	<br><blockquote><p>"more dynamic growth, and employment, helping to underpin social progress."</p></blockquote>
If that is the case, why, in the microcosm of our economy, has a single interest rate not proved ideal for generating growth and employment prospects in the north-east? The Governor of the Bank of England referred to that fact in remarks that subsequently incurred a great deal of criticism. If it is hard in our own economy to have a single rate of interest that is appropriate for all parts of our nation, how much more difficult will it be to have one for all parts of Europe? Is there any likelihood that the single rate of interest will secure job growth and social progress throughout the continent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a crackers question—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman asked about interest rates. Is he proposing having different interest rates in different parts of the United Kingdom—in other words, regional interest rates? Industry must be falling about listening to this. Eighteen months ago, the hon. Gentleman's party was trying to run the British economy. The proposal is not just fantasy, but dangerous nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor, in his statement this week to the Confederation of British Industry, said that the Government are putting forward proposals to ensure that British industry is capable of dealing with the single currency. Whether we are or are not part of it in the initial stages, one thing is certain—the United Kingdom will have to deal with the single currency, either in the purchase and sale of goods and services or in competing for the provision of goods and services. It is vital that the Government invest in a programme that will ensure that the single currency is introduced fairly and effectively and that British business has the inclination and support to cope with it. It is critical that we prepare ourselves for its consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It beggars belief to propose that the United Kingdom needs not a single sterling currency, but one that is split into 11 regions. It is nonsense to suggest that Scotland, the north-east and the north-west should have different currencies. Some British companies have factories and production units in more than one region. What would happen to them?

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
The suggestion is a recipe for chaos and disaster. Thank goodness the British people saw through it and got rid of the Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Four hon. Members are still rising and the Committee has 10 minutes left for questions. I am sure that we can get through all four questions—and, perhaps, another—provided that hon. Members are brief and the Minister co-operates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Geraldine Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is great to note the Opposition's concern about manufacturing and northeast England. It is a shame that they did not express that concern in the early 1980s, when their policies led to the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs. Conservative Members hate regulation and pretend that it causes job losses and is very bad for business. Is it not time for a grown-up debate about regulation and about protecting people in work? Should not Conservative Members recognise that regulation and job creation can happen together and that there does not have to be either one or the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue is whether regulation is appropriate, whether it is based on an assessment of business and the growth of business and whether it enhances employability and competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give two examples of beneficial regulation. This week, a regulation took effect to help small businesses to sort out late payment of debt. The regulation is very positive for business. It ensures that companies have a continual flow of income to maintain themselves, and also that they are not screwed into the ground or collapsed by unscrupulous people and companies that refuse to pay debt. The Competition Act 1998 refurbished the law to ensure that companies are not driven out of business by anticompetitive behaviour. The working time directive will arrest the £25 billion cost to British industry of unregulated absenteeism in the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seek to introduce fair and effective regulations that improve competitiveness and, where possible, ensure minimum standards for workers. The previous Government tried to create a bonfire of regulation, but more industrial regulation was in force when they left office than when they came into it. The Government have a clear pragmatic approach—when regulation is appropriate it will be utilised, but when it is not we will either get rid of it or not introduce it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the explanation of territorial employment tax given by the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister return to the question of local development measures? In answer to my previous question, he explained that they related to land use. Let us assume for a moment that every observation that he made about the previous Government was correct, and entirely remove the issue from party politics. The issue at stake is the development of Europe. why does the Minister think that it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
reasonable and sensible for the European Commission to be involved in local measures involving local land use?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise in an un-political way if the hon. Gentleman did not quite get the drift of my earlier explanation. He asked whether it was important to co-ordinate the territories at a local, national and European level. Land use was one of the issues involved. For areas with infrastructure problems, economies that have completely changed and, consequently, have large areas of unused and derelict land, it seems sensible that a maximum investment package is co-ordinated. That package will include resources from the United Kingdom, from local government and from the private sector. Sometimes it will include resources from a European programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot for the life of me understand the point of the hon. Gentleman's question. Is he suggesting that we should opt out of those resources? Is he saying that we should not accept them, or have objectives 1, 2, 3 and 4, simply because the resources come from Europe? That is an old and discredited argument, which Conservative Members used for years in government. The consequences of it were set out in my reply to an earlier question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that the European Community needs to operate, in a co-ordinated fashion, in key areas of the macro-economy—we must co-ordinate re-investment in infrastructure, for example. We need to target resources under objectives 1, 2, 3 and 4 by way of national plans. That process will continue; thank goodness the Government are behind it. Without such a process, large parts of the UK would be denuded of important resources with which the public and private sectors could work together to refurbish local economies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on from the last question, it seems that my hon. Friend's latest initiatives are about enabling. Most of that enabling will be allowed to take place at a national level. Surely that is a good thing, is it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that as pure common sense. There are 18 million unemployed across the European Union, 9 million of whom have been unemployed for more than a year. Moreover, we inherited from the previous Government structural employment and social deprivation in many regions of the UK, so we need to put together a strategy to deal with employability by investing in training, education and job opportunities, in entrepreneurship and in sustainable new companies. We need to provide workers with more adaptable skills and reskill them when their skills have been outmoded because a particular industry has left. We need to provide equal opportunities for those groups and individuals in society with special needs who cannot enter or sustain themselves in the labour market. Our strategy seems a reasonable and sensible approach for a modern Government. For the life of me, I cannot get my head round some of the Opposition's questions and comments this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend thought about the implementation of this programme? As I understand it, the resources that underpin it will be distributed through blocks of money such as the European regional development fund and the ESF, which tend to be distributed in areas with various objective statuses by way of what, for want of a better word, I shall call quangos. Those quangos tend not to have the same objectives as are set out in the document. What will the Government do to try to reform that process of distribution and bring this programme to life?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, as we move towards elected mayors, have the Government considered the possibility that some of those mayors will not even get a seat on the board of bodies that implement such programmes, and therefore will not have a say in how this programme is implemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what my hon. Friend is saying about elected mayors, but that is another policy issue which may or may not be relevant to what we are discussing today. I set out the structure for our objectives over the next two and a half years and I went on to say that I would come back at a later date with plans for working out the specific arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend was also asking how, in the process of discussion, we can ensure that the UK gets its fair share of resources. I give him an absolute guarantee that Ministers will be tenacious in their efforts to ensure both a successful outcome for this programme and that any consequential potential investment resources will come to the UK. Alongside that, of course, we shall continue our strategy of inward investment. We want even more inward investment projects this year than we had last year and the previous year. If my hon. Friend was looking for that assurance, I can give it to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Estonia, for example, is in the first wave, and to a considerable extent its trade is still directed towards its neighbour, Russia. That trade has collapsed, but the Commission imagines that Estonia can pursue the social projects—the adequate systems of social protection and health and the other expensive core programmes for social action—that in the real world can be afforded only when the wealth has been generated.

	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 8328/98, a Commission Communication on its proposed Social Action Programme for 1998–2000; supports the Government's view that the Programme rightly places jobs at the heart of its framework for action; and also supports the Government's intention to give due consideration to specific Commission proposals as they come forward.</p></blockquote>
The motion gives the Government an opportunity to make clear why the social action programme is important and why this country must play a positive role in deliberations about the programme's structure and content. The programme will have a positive effect on the economies of the United Kingdom and of Europe because, essentially, Europe is our home market—o deny that is economic nonsense and a folly of extreme proportions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in everyone's interests that the main tenets of the programme that I have described today are effective in each member state. The result of that will be that people affected by long-term structural unemployment will have an opportunity of employability in the real labour market. People without skills will benefit from investment in skills. Others will benefit from intermediate labour market status and thus be able to play an effective role in the economy. People with disabilities or other special social needs that prevent them from joining or staying in the labour market will benefit from investment to rectify such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other, linked programmes will ensure that concerted action is taken across the European Union to provide employment opportunities. They will also present business throughout Europe with the challenge of a competitive agenda that is based not on spiralling down wages and conditions, but on investment—in the work force, in research and development and in the promotion of new products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An adaptable work force is needed to meet the demands of the global economy. To compete with the big players, European businesses must be able to enhance their supply chain networks. A healthy supply chain mechanism means that new small and medium-sized enterprises will flourish in all sectors of the economies of the United Kingdom and Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, it must be recognised, once and for all, that there can be no divide between education, science and research and development on the one hand, and, on the other, the resulting ability to produce products for the market place. Through investment in education and training at higher and further education colleges and in training programmes we will supply the missing link between education and the work place. The state, employers and individual companies must invest in

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
that link to increase the adaptability and employability of many people in Europe who suffer from the risk of globalisation because they lack skills or knowledge or because they are unable to gain new skills and knowledge to protect themselves and their companies' futures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme is extensive, well researched and well financed. For the first time in Europe, we are not just talking about jobs, investment and research and development, but are in the business of creating them and making them happen. For all those reasons, the new employment strategy and what goes with it is to be welcomed. Regardless of party political differences, I hope that, at the very least, the Opposition will welcome the programme as a genuine effort to promote employability, entrepreneurship, equal opportunities and an adaptable work force. If they can agree to that, we shall make progress. If they do not, we shall leave them behind because we are not prepared to see the European and United Kingdom economies left behind in a global race. We want to ensure that Europe and Britain have the capacity to cope with international changes. We must be able to fashion those changes and must not let them fashion us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are sending a positive message, and I make a further commitment. I will return to the House to give specific examples of how the programme is working in practice. That will give the House the opportunity to challenge and question the Government on whether we are carrying out the promises that we have given with regard to these objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.35 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be relieved to hear that I am not against social cohesion. As someone with a modest aspiration towards traditional Tory values. I very much welcome, and hope to work towards, social cohesion. However, I have reservations about the habit of Ministers and Labour Back Benchers suggesting that social cohesion came into existence on 1 May 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was the Minister with responsibility for vocational education in the previous Administration. I constantly emphasised the importance of skills and the inclusion of all people in the process of aquiring them, and I will continue to do that. For example, I have been following with considerable interest the fortunes of a company in the hospitality industry, which is not traditionally a high technology or high wage sector. It has made a strong commitment to skills and that has been reflected in its bottom line. There is no argument between us on the importance of skills, but Ministers should not imply that the concept has just been invented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make a second disclaimer: I am not against the concept of the European Community. My track record shows that. I have misgivings, however, about whether the European Community is always the most appropriate vehicle with which to proceed. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
rhetoric that it characteristically employs sometimes takes it further than the reality. That was the point behind some of our earlier questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I can borrow a colourful epithet from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, I would say that the document is characterised by gut-wrenching banality. It reminds me of Oscar Wilde's famous remark about the deathbed scene of Dickens' Little Nell. He said that no person of sensibility could possibly read it without helpless laughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Serious issues are before us and we need to return to them. However, it is a little difficult to do that on the back of assertions such as those in the document. Page 9 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the core values of the European social model for the future".</p></blockquote>
In addition, we can all sign up without further comment to the amazing assertion on page 3 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"social policy should promote a decent quality of life and standard of living for all in an active, inclusive and healthy society that encourages access to employment, good working conditions, and equality of opportunity."</p></blockquote>
Amen to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the document in a slightly derogatory way for two reasons. First, to assert something is not to achieve it. Secondly, the flowery and vague phrasing used leads me towards counting the spoons and to considering what the underlying agenda may or may not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has tried to be fair, but I have some overall concerns. The first relates to the concept of subsidiarity. My hon. Friends the Members for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson)—and, modestly, myself—asked about the relevance of doing that at the European level, but we did not get a full answer in any particular. The Minister may rightly say, "We don't have a programme at the moment. We have a framework but no programme." We shall ask specific questions when he comes forward with specific proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had some responsibility for negotiating Socrates and I took an interest in Leonardo da Vinci, which are referred to in the document. Some European activities are proper, including, for example, the concertation of policies, to use the European phrase. We should also consider—this may be of interest to my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset—the situation at the regional level, where regions abut one another across national boundaries. The closest examples to Great Britain are the Irish land frontier and the association of Kent with the Pas de Calais, although those cases are not unique. It is right to consider such matters and sensible for European member states to share good practice. We have no problem with that. However, we should not use such cases as a vehicle for Community level interference in what should be properly tailored national policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to my second point. I felt that the Minister—perhaps accidentally—may have confused two issues that are distinct. The first issue, subsidiarity, comes within the competence that the Commission and the Community have, under the terms of the Amsterdam treaty, for social and employment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
matters. The second issue, legal competence, is another matter. Those two issues are closely related but they should be kept distinct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have worries about what might be termed—again to use the European phrase—the Commission's irredentist traditions. It has moved into areas that, in view of the agreements that have been reached, are none of its business. Members of the Committee will be familiar with our concerns about the working time directive. We have objections in principle and about the use of the vehicle of health and safety legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will return to the suggestion that we are not interested in minimum standards of operator safety. He did not comment on that earlier—or at least I do not think he did. I have seen practices in Italian glass-blowing works about which I should not hesitate to blow the whistle, although I suspect that no one there does so, which is not good enough. It worries me that proposals about working times, which we are not discussing explicitly today, have been launched through the vehicle that I mentioned. The document contains brief references to tax policy, pensions and the wider agenda, which go further than the Committee's proper concerns. I hope that the Minister will bear in mind the fact that those two matters—subsidiarity and legal competence—operate closely together, and that there is a distinction between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two other matters were raised in Question Time but they were not fully discussed for understandable reasons—no specific proposals are before us. The first relates to cost and the second involves the implications of enlargement. If extra cost is involved at the European level, that might have a displacement effect in relation to enlargement. If impositions are placed on applicant states that are unreasonable in relation to their history, they will not be able to sustain their rate of employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One aspect of that matter is especially germane, namely that if the application of those states to join the European Union is to be successful, they will have to meet the criteria for participation in the single currency. That could put considerable budgetary constraints on them, which would have an adverse affect on their employment and social policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is indeed a matter of concern. I should also put a gloss on my hon. Friend's remarks earlier. I thought that the Minister was less than charitable to him. The Minister seemed to be saying, "Given the problems that we have within the single currency,"—the Opposition have no proposal to remove what I might call the British single currency—"a fortiori there will be much greater problems if one puts member states into a European single currency." However, those matters will no doubt be resolved in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point arises once we have overcome the subsidiarity and competence issues. We still have some reservations about whether the social agenda—to use the shorthand—can be brought about by legislation at the national level. The Minister knows that we are concerned about how the whole complex that goes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
under the name of fairness at work—that might include working time and the minimum wage—should be produced in legislation, if indeed it should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument creates a grey cloud over the general area covered by the document but it is unclear whether it will rain on any particular part of it. Does he wish any paragraphs or sentences of the document to be deleted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I hope both to refer to some of the more risible general aspirations in the document and to make the point that if we move from general aspirations—which are all that appear at the moment because there are no specific proposals—and if we do that in an atmosphere of unconsidered goodwill without probing the intentions of the Community, there is a danger that the commission's propensity to expand its activities will allow that to happen, even when it is not in the best interests of Britain or its employment. Then we shall find ourselves saddled with several consequences that we did not intend. I find it difficult to take exception to some of the more general propositions in the document, but I shall assist the Minister by returning to what I was saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should continue to think in terms of national policy—if this is to remain at national level as part of our national employment action—about whether matters should be launched in legislation in the UK, involving record keeping and cost on business, if they can be clearly demonstrated to be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that Conservative Members feel strongly that the most important element of the employment relationship is that between employer and employee. The Minister will rightly say to me that there are occasionally bad employers, and I am sure that he will concede that there are also bad employees, but Government intervention should not generally intrude on practices that are agreed by both parties and clearly seen to be in their interests because that is how they want to operate. If Government supplant the relationship between employer and employee, as they are sometimes in danger of doing, we may have problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by returning to something that the Minister conceded in earlier exchanges—the economic context in which this occurs. To be political for a moment, I watch with interest as new Labour evolves and responds to events. Both in the Minister's remarks and in some of the exchanges that have taken place, I see the characteristic dialogue that is going on within that party. Today, the Minister acted very much in the Dr. Jekyll mode, saying that the Government want to emphasise employability and jobs and to be competitive. That is great—I agree with that—but a suppressed Mr. Hyde was also revealed in the exchanges; the Government want to protect employment and regulate bad employers and keep the situation under control. As the Minister knows, that is a lively debate throughout the European Community, where, at least in his public statements, the Prime Minister has cast himself on the side of the angels, emphasising competitiveness and job creation.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
However, there are forces, of which he is aware, that tend to emphasise job protection, even where it damages competitiveness and increases cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My underlying concern is that we should have regard to the need for balance, all the more so because of the economic context in which this is happening. There is a real danger that European levels of unemployment, which are unacceptably high—the Minister mentioned 18 million, more than the population of the Netherlands—because of high levels of social protection, will be further compounded, either by legislative action in Europe or the deteriorating global economic situation. It is essential that the politics of the soundbite, which could explain how a social programme would help people, or the politics of genuine anger and social concern about matters that we would like to be otherwise, do not drive the Government or the Community to take decisions that would have a perverse social effect. Although designed to create or protect employment, the decisions might turn out to destroy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger in Europe of a high overall cost of employment, even in those countries where it is associated with a high level of productivity. The extent of the Secretary of State's concerns about the productivity gap in the United Kingdom will be reinforced if we transfer our costs to a European level of costs because that would expose a further degree of uncompetitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is self-evident from the experience of Germany—a country that I know well—that there are over-high social costs. There is a large mark-up on the unit of employment and traditionally, although not currently, its currency is a strong one to match. However good the internal arrangements, it is difficult to fight that problem. The German economy has a strong tradition of technology, investment and skills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentlemen's comments on Germany. I know something of that country, which I recently visited. He mentioned the high social costs of employment there but, at the same time, Germany has high productivity, which is better than our's, and an export-trade surplus, and it does well in competitive terms. Can he explain that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The exact point is that we are trying to find a balance. What is interesting about Germany is it has more than 4 million unemployed. That is a serious and endemic problem which I believe, as a fraternal party, has contributed significantly to the removal of the Christian Democrat Government. There is a balancing act to be achieved, but it is not cost-free to impose social costs on employment. The likely consequence of that would be to lower employment. If other economic circumstances aggravate that, we will create a social problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole of the Community is rightly worried about its unemployment levels. What we do not need through the social proposals is an enhancement of employment costs and a reduction in competitiveness.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
Both the Community, where it is operating properly to add value, and the Minister, operating at his own level, should concentrate on competitiveness and productivity. If he ensures that the employment sector is not saddled with additional unnecessary costs, he will have begun to point his policies in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.53 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) asserted that social cohesion did not start on 1 May 1997. That is probably true. We could, however, speculate that that is when cohesion began in Europe. My hon. Friend the Minister rightly said that the previous Government's attitude to any move towards cohesion was negative and obstructive. The comment that social cohesion did not start on 1 May last year must be placed in that context. There is a philosophical divide between the Government and the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I generally welcome the social action programme. It touches the important buttons that people in the United Kingdom and the European Union need to emphasise if we are to make an impact on the scourge of unemployment. My hon. Friend the Minister has underlined that in no uncertain terms, and I strongly support that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the short time available, I wish to emphasise two points to which my hon. Friend might respond. First, the document states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"economic and monetary union will bring advantages for Europe in terms of greater … stability, sustainable growth",</p></blockquote>
and so on. Like many people, we hope that that will happen. The document makes a number of such references—I tried to count them. However, given that the social action programme under discussion today covers a two-year period, it cannot reach firm conclusions on the effects of the single currency by the year 2000. The document fails to mention, let alone analyse, the possibility that economic and monetary union will increase unemployment in some parts of the EU because of the lack of the necessary flexibility of labour. That is a real issue, to which my hon. Friend should make reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the programme is extremely important, similar programmes may need to be greatly expanded. Moreover, we may face the prospect of a significant transfer of resources within the EU, which would impact on social action programmes such as the one before us. However, the document makes no mention of such matters. Instead, it refers repeatedly to the benefits that economic and monetary union will hopefully bring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, some Committee members would not welcome such a union at any price, but that is the assertion that the document makes on several occasions. In some ways, the whole of the programme is predicated on that assertion. I find that disconcerting. Given the time scale, let alone other considerations, my hon. Friend should note the importance of the issue to which I refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
My hon. Friend mentioned the Jeremiah tendency, who risk talking down the economy, in particular the manufacturing sector. However, when discussing the social action programme, flexibility of labour and changes in economic activity, we should recognise that manufacturing faces difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that, in order to make such action programmes more effective, Government activities at both national and European level must be co-ordinated. Areas in the UK must meet a number of criteria to qualify for some of the action programmes, including unemployment. Thankfully, according to official figures, unemployment is coming down, although that is a matter of debate. At the same time, in some areas the traditional manufacturing industry is in decline, while dependence on single sector manufacturing industries has increased. However, such single sector industries are simply not recognised by the documents before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to co-ordination, which Labour Members certainly support. Although I was heartened to learn from him that Ministers are fighting strongly to ensure that the UK maintains a fair share of the available structural and social funds, the context that I have outlined should be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue to which I wish to refer is subsidiarity. I welcome the fact that my hon. Friend the Minister gave a clear response to questions on that issue from my hon. Friends. I do not accept suggestions that co-ordination in the European Union is undesirable or that it cannot be implemented effectively in member states: co-ordination is the way forward. Page 10 of the document sets out—with ticks at the side to enhance the presentation—some of the Commission's co-ordination objectives, including some relating to social security schemes to which I referred earlier. I worry that that could be another example of the mindset that sometimes prevails in the Commission—not only are the programmes necessary, but the Commission is the only body that can implement them. I hope that I am not creating red herrings or setting hares running; I have some experience of the European Union and have seen such an attitude prevail, as we all have. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Minister is not only aware of that issue, but is stating the Government's position on it. He did so not only on the Commission' proposals, but on the actions taken by the Commission this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final brief comment is on a matter that my hon. Friend the Minister may regard as not within his brief, although it is covered by the document. I find it amazing—it is the umpteenth time that I have seen such a thing—that the document says that the Commission will
	<br><blockquote><p>"pursue the strategy on combating tobacco consumption set out in the Commission's 1996 Communication".</p></blockquote>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will forgive me, but as the document mentions this point it may be legitimately raised. The time is long overdue for Governments and the European Union to get rid of the massive, dangerous and perverse contradiction whereby such a policy exists alongside the pumping of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
millions in subsidies into the tobacco industry. I do not expect my hon. Friend the Minister to have an answer to that today, but it is legitimate to raise it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has done an uncharacteristically good job. He has produced a resolution that is unexceptionable in every word. I do not quite understand why he has gone to such trouble—even if we had been moved to vote against it, we could not have had any effect—but I commend him for doing so. The hard-working officials of the European Commission have also clearly taken a lot of time and trouble over their social action programme, but the document resembles an undergraduate essay full of wordy padding. In Euro talk, it is more of a souffle than a fundamentally satisfying intellectual meal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is typical of its kind, but it does not take the argument significantly further forward. The hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Miss Smith) tried to do so: my text will be hers. She said that it was possible to have both regulations and job creation—we would all agree with that. The tragedy of the social action programme is that it exemplifies the diffidence about our own capabilities, and the instinctive deference to the European model over our own. Our country must begin to regain confidence in the ability of its own institutions, Parliament and people to work out between them the appropriate social programmes to ensure the prosperity and effective working together of people in these islands. I am not convinced, and nothing in the social action programme suggests that the European model is inherently better in any way whatever. If the social action programme is to work, it must have the inherent legitimacy which derives from the fundamental consent of the people who are subject to its provisions so that they can modify and improve them to better the circumstances of themselves and their families and the places in which they work. The more remote the process of social regulation from their own workplace and family environment, the harder that will be, especially when it is subject to qualified majority voting. Even if the Governemt were to assert themselves, there would be no guarantee that the wishes of our people would prevail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Geraldine Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morecambe and Lunesdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Conservative party believe in a national minimum wage if it does not believe in a sweat-shop economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Conservative party does not believe in a national minimum wage. Our shadow Front Bench spokesmen, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) is one, have made it clear that we believe that our people—our workers and our employers—should be able to decide for themselves the appropriate level of remuneration. No one gives of his labour in this society unless he wants to. There is nothing strange or perverse about our position, which is replicated in many dynamic economies where employment is far higher than here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four pillars or principles on which employment is best generated are cited in the social action programme—employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities. Those are fine sentiments, but more important for job creation and sustainability of a dynamic economy are the cost of capital and labour, the level of investment, the rate of exchange and, to achieve that, appropriate fiscal and monetary policies. Those are best determined at national level where control is more easily achieved. The social action programme contains a list of desiderata, but not the prerequisites for growth and higher employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely there is inherent merit in disparaging social models within our continent. In north America, would the Candaians dream of having the United States' social model rammed down their throats? Will the Taiwanese want the social model of the People's Republic of China rammed down their throats? Will the Singaporeans want that of Malaysia? No, because they became prosperous only when they seceded from the Malaysian federation. The social action programme—laudable as its objectives are—is based on a whole series of fallacies, which are worth exposing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard some interesting comments from the Opposition. Their commitment to social cohesion is interesting. The hon. Member for Daventry admitted that Conservative Members were in favour of it. Given Margaret Thatcher's comment that there was no such thing as society, it is interesting that they now support social cohesion. There is obviously not much in the Conservative party in Parliament, but that is another issue. We have seen some interesting splits on the Conservative Benches today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
The document before us is important because it attacks poverty and social exclusion and puts jobs at the heart of Europe. It is, however, less prescriptive than earlier documents. We are in an interesting position. We have a Labour Government and a policy that is less prescriptive than previous social action programmes which were discussed and agreed under the previous Government. Many commentators agree with that view, which is interesting. One commentator, Jeff Kenner, wrote in the 	<i>New Law Journal:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whereas past action programmes of the Commission have focused mainly on legislative action to promote minimum standards and targeted social programmes to be supported by the European Social fund, the latest set of initiatives concentrate on enabling action, to be carried out primarily at national level, to create employment and to combat social exclusion."</p></blockquote>
That is laudable. The programme is enabling. Enabling action is particularly important and will be carried out at national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is the import that the social action programme places on jobs, employability and social exclusion: it puts them at the heart of European social policy. What has been missing from some debates—particularly from the Opposition—is any mention of flexibility or the free movement of workers. The pattern is changing. People have asked several times, "Why should Europe decide these things? How does it affect us?" The fact is, however, that more and more people work in different countries in Europe, and an increasing number of people from this country work abroad. The position on flexibility is changing all the time. We are in a changing world and the flexibility and free movement of workers is a central focus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Europe faces the jobs challenge. We have to help people to develop the skills and adaptability that they need to stay in employment. We live in a fast-changing world, and the 21st century will be completely different. The problem is all about addressing such issues and we cannot do that in isolation because of the changes that I have described in the European market and the jobs market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has to be a consistent economic strategy for stability, growth and employment. Again, we cannot achieve that in isolation; we can deal with the issues much better in Europe. Europe is a major economic player; it is not just talked about or packed away in a cupboard somewhere. We are very much a part of Europe, and so we should be. We should play an increasingly important part in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have a solid and sustainable base on which to improve living standards in the European Union. There was much on that in my hon. Friend the Minister's comments and in the paper's proposals. Best practice and innovation are crucial, and there is much here and in other countries. We need to learn from each other and to talk about and deal with the issues. We need to promote innovation as a form of job creation. Local development measures are needed. Those are the areas in which there can be improvement and which offer a way forward to meet the challenges of the next century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to increase investment. We should not just stand by and hope that it happens, but actively participate in creating more investment and research

and development. I think of constituencies such as mine in Halton. The hon. Member for West Dorset asked about the programme's impact on national and local schemes. The structural funds are obviously prescriptive to the extent that they say that certain things must be achieved. But what happens in different constituencies and different parts of the country depends on the initiatives taken there and what is best for the area concerned. I see no contradiction in what this document proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency of Halton still has a lot of structural unemployment, although the situation is gradually improving. The skills deficit is a major problem. Figures produced a few years ago in my constituency by local business showed that it was about 40 per cent. There is a similar problem with youth unemployment. Such problems are not unique to my constituency, but apply in other parts of the country and throughout Europe. From my experience and from what I understand happens, believe that these proposals shed a lot of light on what needs to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The collaborative approach is particularly important, with co-operation between member states on family-friendly employment policies. My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) referred to a competitive edge. If we had followed the policies of the previous Government, we would have had sweat-shop Britain, paying low wages, usually in the service sector, at the expense of more highly skilled jobs, which would have gone to countries such as France and Germany in particular. We have only to look at Rover where there was talk of bringing in people from Germany because we did not have the necessary skills in this country. Two out of five manufacturing jobs disappeared during the 18 years of Tory Government. Manufacturing jobs were sacrificed for low-paid service jobs. That is not the way forward or the way for our country to be competitive. The social action programme promotes skills, training and life-long learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of having good health and safety practices throughout Europe has been mentioned. The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about glass-blowing in Italy. Does the same apply to St. Helens, a major glass manufacturer? Does Italy have a competitive edge in that industry because there is less regulation when it comes to health and safety matters, which is reflected in the cost? That is an issue that we must deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equal opportunities was also mentioned briefly. That is an important part of these proposals and must be dealt with. There is a lot of good practice in this country which can be shared, and we can pick up good practices from elsewhere. We must try and improve equal opportunities throughout the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document refers to the importance of health, which is a significant aspect of poverty and social exclusion. Smoking and the tobacco industry have been mentioned. Tackling health at the European level is fundamental in combating poverty and social exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
Finally, Conservative Members believe that there are too many regulations. The number of regulations rocketed under the previous Government and it is a fallacy to say that they reduce it. The burden of regulations on British industry is important. My hon. Friend the Minister has reassured me that there must be a balance between policies and that there must not be too much of a burden on industry. The social action programme addresses that, and I am pleased that my hon. Friend has recognised it as an important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by accusing the Minister of subterfuge, although that is not intended as a slur on his character. I admit that I have a sneaking liking for the Minister—perhaps even a degree of admiration—as a result of long encounters with him in many circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman be more explicit about that? [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not threaten the Minister's career, which is doing nicely, by expanding further on that remark. The hon. Gentleman said that he did not understand my question, but I know him—I know his intelligence—too well to believe that. He knew perfectly well what my question was aiming at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was deeply despondant at the beginning of this sitting but, as often happens during debates in this Committee, I have become considerably more optimistic. A great deal of sense and even a degree of common ground has emerged during our deliberations. It is on that very point that I should like to say a few words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the argument made by a Labour Member—I was afraid that I cannot remember who—that to avoid competition in a single market between economies with low wages and less protection and those with higher wages and more protection, logically one has to admit that the European Community has a role in deciding certain forms of social regulation that would apply in all member states. I do not share the view that a single market is desirable, but I understand that, without such regulation, there would otherwise be a tendency for some member states to encourage lower wages and less social protection in order to compete more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I happen to believe that in the end such competition is more likely to raise living standards in the Community as a whole vis-à-vis the rest of world—we must remember that the EU is not just an internal market but exists in the world—than are measures designed to achieve a level of social protection that ultimately will render the EU less competitive on a global scale. However, I shall not press that argument now. I admit that a case can be made, given the Government's ambitions and in the terms that I have described, for Community-wide regulation of labour practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
Alas, the document does not restrict itself to such matters. Although it contains a lot of words, the document—like many others—does not say very much. Even so, there is remarkably little about social regulation and a great deal about other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could have chosen many examples, but my eye alighted on a paragraph on page 6. The argument that I described does not apply to local development measures or regional employment pacts. In particular, it does not apply to land use, which the Minister mentioned. On page 10, we are told that attention will be paid to making tax and benefit systems "more employment friendly" and that social security schemes will be adjusted. Such mattes are not questions of regulation but of actions that the Commission imagines will be beneficial. Whether they will prove to be so I cannot say, but they are matters that the Commission believes that it should bring about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noted the hon. Gentleman's earlier remark that there is a logical link between desiring a degree of social protection and having a European policy on it to avoid countries undercutting each other. Does he accept that the same logical link applies to tax and benefits policy? Without such a link, countries that want to pursue a tax and benefits policy that they believe will have desirable social effects may be undercut by other, more aggressive, countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As often, the hon. Gentleman makes an intelligent contribution to the debate. I can see how that logic might apply. I suppose that those Committee members who believe that we must always ensure that there is no competition between member states would accept as a logical conclusion that the European Community should run all aspects of government. Such a conclusion is in part why I do not accept any of the premises of the argument, but it derives logically from the principle that there should be no competition on any front between one member state and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether even the hon. Member for Broxtowe would want to press the point that far. He is pressing it very far if he can live with the statements about tax and social security, because they are very close to the essence of domestic policy. But I have alighted on the particular example of local land use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deny that even the most thoroughgoing pretension to competition between member states, the most rigorous attempt to avoid such competition, and the most ruthlessly logical approach to transferring powers to the Community in order to avoid such competition, could conceivably justify the Commission's involvement in local land use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that there may be an argument for having, as the Minister said, schemes for the use of local land. I accept that perfectly reasonable argument. I accept that if there is European funding—I merely anticipate the Minister repeating what he said—for such things, it may be sensible for the UK to apply for it. That is a matter for his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, given the Fontainebleu agreement. That was largely what prevented Conservative Members
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
from wishing to see these funds used and it is currently preventing his right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Foods from wanting to use the agrimonetary compensation. It is the same argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be an argument for using the funds if they were there, but not for the funds being there in the first place. I do not see why it makes sense, on any of the grounds that we have been talking about, for the member states—or rather the taxpayers of the member states—to transfer moneys to Brussels in order to recapture as much as they can for the purpose of developing local land. I fail entirely to see the logic of that proposition, in fact, I do not believe that the Minister himself sees the logic, although he may deny it. I doubt that any Committee member sees the logic. I very much doubt that the Commission itself believes that there is logic in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is something else going on—something with which we have become entirely familiar and of which many hon. Members on both sides of the House warned in the debate on the relevant clauses of the Bill which enacted the Amsterdam treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem with the hon. Gentleman's argument about budget contributions—or any revenue contributions—to the EU is that it is, with respect, simplistic. He seems to be arguing that if we put a pound in, we must get a pound out. The idea of member states contributing to the EU is to promote general Community prosperity, which is of benefit to us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have obviously failed to make myself clear. I was not arguing that we should or should not seek to put a pound in and get a pound out; nor am I concerned about the budgetary contributions as such. I am arguing that there is no logic for an arrangement under which the Community extracts money from the taxpayers of particular member states and recycles it to member states for the purpose of local development initiatives, such as land use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems a far neater solution for those issues to be dealt with through local authorities or, if it must be so, through the Parliaments of each member state. I believe that logic to be so strong in terms of subsidiarity—to which the Commission officially signs up—that the Commission itself cannot have imagined that this particular passage was justified in terms of that logic. I think I know what is really going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me develop my argument one stage further, then I shall certainly give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has spotted that the Amsterdam treaty creates a larger area within which it can operate. The treaty gives the Commission a huge new set of competencies which are, alas, ill defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social action is as wide or as narrow as the person using the phrase wishes to make it. It can encompass tax, benefits, the whole of social security, the police, health and almost everything else. It can also be very narrow, relating entirely to the regulation of employment practices. The Commission has taken it in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
the widest possible sense, which is no surprise to many of us, and has produced an admittedly vague but none the less powerful document containing a set of programmes that, if implemented in their full detail, may cover spheres in which even the strongest proponents of the Amsterdam treaty never intended the Commission to involve itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that the purpose of today's sitting is for Committee Members to investigate—thinking of ourselves not so much as members of the British Parliament as contributors to the development and evolution of the European Union—whether the material presented to us is a reasonable interpretation by the Commission of the role that it was given, not by God Almighty or by itself, but by the member states under the Amsterdam treaty. In many parts of the document, the Commission is arrogating to itself matters that could derive from competencies provided for it under the Amsterdam treaty, but which go way beyond the logic intended to justify them, and beyond the logic used by Labour Members, with whom I may disagree about specific points, but who make some intelligent contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman still wishes to intervene, I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke about paying money in only to bid for it to come out. The logic is that sometimes the money does not come back because it is decided at a European level where it would be best spent to create a level playing field between the various countries to stop the undercutting about which my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet spoke. That is why I referred to the pound in and the pound out. Sometimes it does not come back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the Committee would indulge me for a moment, I should like to ask it to bring some social action into the debate. I shall call the Minister soon after a quarter to 1, and three hon. Members still wish to speak. I cannot ask hon. Members to shorten their speeches, but the Committee may wish to debate the social action that was discussed so much earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the need for social cohesion, I shall not dwell for more than a minute on the remarks of the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I checked that it could be argued that the playing field should be levelled in yet another respect, by ensuring that there is not too great a variety of regional imbalances. To add that matter to the rest of the programme would stretch the Commission's competency to a point at which it would become almost impossible to argue that it should not intervene in every aspect of life. That is my objection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the remarks of my hon. Friend the Minister, and I should like to applaud the excellent work that he has done on employment policy throughout his time as a Minister. I am sure that we would all support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
The document begins by stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Employment policy has moved decisively to the top of the European agenda."</p></blockquote>
All hon. Members should say hurrah to that. It has taken a long time, and employment policy has been well down the list of objectives in the European Community for some time. Events have compelled European politics in that direction, as was underlined this week by Jacques Attali, president of the European investment bank, who said that inflation is dead. He said that very definitely, implying that, very much like John Cleese's parrot, it is not sleeping or resting, but dead. I could develop that theme if I had more time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A worldwide experiment in neo-liberalism has brought the world economy to the edge of crisis. People are suddenly waking up and realising that an impending disaster will occur unless we change. Extreme free-market policies have already led to disaster in at least one country—Russia. Soviet communism did not work especially well, but extreme laissez-faire capitalism works even less well there. European countries are now seeking to return to policies involving more economic management, nationally and in the Community. I welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the world economy, we see that Malaysia has recently reintroduced exchange controls. Hong Kong has decided on intervention to prop up its stock market. God knows what is being done in Russia, but it is not laissez faire. I believe that Britain is moving in the right direction. George Soros is launching a relevant book in the House in December, and has a meeting here. I hope to attend, and look forward to it. More than anyone else, he knows how the global market works, and says that we have made profound mistakes. The country and the Labour party have cause to be grateful to George Soros. In 1992, he did more than anyone else to destroy the potty ERM strategy. That led to the collapse of support for the Conservative party and to the eventual election of a Labour Government. George Soros should be congratulated on both points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employment policy is not just about micro-measures, efficient labour markets, training and education. It is about macro-economic policy as well, and I ask the Minister to emphasise that point to his colleagues in the Treasury and elsewhere. The economy cannot be run on micro-economic policies and the supply side alone—we must also take into account macro-economic policies and the demand side. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood was right to draw attention to the fact that there is a gaping hole in demand in the world economy as a result of recent global strategies. That will not only kill off inflation—it could also kill off jobs if those responsible are not careful. Europe is beginning to move in the right direction in that respect, but it should go further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point touches on the remarks that were made by the hon. Member for West Dorset and by my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling during the debate about social grants and social spending. I understand that contributions do not come back exactly pound for pound. However, there should be a degree of equity in the way in which they are distributed, and Britain is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
treated very inequitably. Between 1994 and 1997, the UK had a deficit in economic and social grants of £7.7 billion and was the fourth poorest in the EU table of prosperity by GDP per head. The UK is the second highest contributor with the second highest deficit. That is not equitable. A mechanism for promoting equity in the distribution of economic and social grants should be developed. Will the Minister do what he can to address that? Speaking from my own experience, the eastern region of the country has suffered as a result of cuts in social fund spending. It is one of the more prosperous regions of the country—although that is not the case in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document refers to the free movement of workers within Europe. I have always had a problem with that concept, which appears to treat workers as a simple factor of production such as capital. They cannot be treated like capital because capital flows very quickly—in the case of financial capital, at the touch of a button. Even fixed capital can be transported quite easily: machines work just as happily in Germany or Portugal as they do in south Wales. Employees are not so mobile, and to view them as a quid pro quo to the free movement of capital is not good enough. We must accept that most employees will require work where they live or grew up, or at least in the member state in which they live. An unemployed 52-year-old miner is not going to get on his bike and ride to Hamburg to get a job in the pharmaceutical industry. We should press the European Union to acknowledge that, and to develop policies that promote equality in living standards across the EU as a whole. We do not want to return to the days of Lord Tebbit's bicycle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the issue of racism. Racism in Europe arises largely as a result of high levels of unemployment and of differential living standards, particularly in cities. In my own town, the ethnic minority members of the community have much higher levels of unemployment and deprivation than do the white population. That is a receipt for conflict when unemployment arises. Even if the imbalance were corrected, there would still be conflict and friction between workers. In conditions of full employment, those frictions dissolve and there is no reason for racism to develop. Racism is always present to some extent, but unemployment and economic insecurity generate the environment for racism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to welcome the appointment of Oskar Lafontaine to the German Government. At long last, Europe has at least one Finance Minister who understands how to run the economy with the aim of achieving full employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief so that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) can make his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
The best businesses are partnerships between the staff, the management, the board and the shareholders. All those interests have to be recognised in the partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition say that regulation and social costs impinge on businesses. If social costs are too high, they will impinge on businesses. However, workers have rights and needs, too. Labour Members are merely saying that the pendulum has swung too far away from the needs of the work force. We want the pendulum to swing a little way back, and that can be done through the working time directive, the minimum wage and other measures that the Government have introduced. However, we will not swing the pendulum so far back that it will make industry uncompetitive. In fact, recognising the needs of the work force will make industry more competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most successful industries move forward and the most successful economies are those that recognise that industries need to move forward. They manage that movement. I do not believe that the traditional industries on which we have depended for the past 20 years are where the future of this country lies. Our future is in chemicals, particularly speciality chemicals, pharmaceuticals, information technology, the high-technology and the knowledge-based industries and in research. That is where we need to be. The same is increasingly true of industry in the rest of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must manage the transition from where we are today to the new industries. That involves investment in lifelong learning and in training, support for venture capital and banking reforms. It also requires additional resources to encourage those industries. Such a commitment is reflected in the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on his statement yesterday. One aspect of it that has not been widely discussed in the media was his announcement of the very reforms that will underpin the transformation of our industry. The European social programme will help this country and the rest of Europe manage that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still have some doubts about the programme. As Opposition Members have said, the document is just a list of aspirations. It runs to 17 pages, but the meat of it could have been expressed in two sentences. However, it is no different from the other European documents that the Committee considers. At least this one contains 17 pages, not the 700 pages through which we usually have to wade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister said, this country needs to get its share of the programme's resources. However, we need to reconsider how we shall distribute them once we have got them. Resources tend to be distributed through regeneration partnerships that are made up of business men with vested interests. People based in the community are represented, but only about 20 per cent. of the members of such committees are elected councillors. I will buy the Minister a meal in my favourite restaurant in my constituency if he can find a single person on those committees who has ever read the European social
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
programme document. How can the committees attain our goals if they do not share them? We must reconsider the way in which the money is distributed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if we are to create jobs, we must underpin the local economies that are currently blowing in the economic wind. I unashamedly admit that south Thanet falls into that group. When the wind blows cold, we catch a chill. When the wind blows warm, we think that recovery may at last have arrived, but the wind then changes. The European social programme must give us the resources that will enable us to build a self-sufficient economy. If it can do that in my constituency and in the rest of Europe, it will do a great deal for the people of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Minister's response to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I want to commend the external aspect, which my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling raised earlier this week during our debate on the World Trade Organisation and its involvement in social issues. We very much hope that the European Community will take a lead and address the problem. As was said earlier, the European Union is not alone in the world, and we must consider the impact of undercutting the worldwide level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to express slight doubts about the Government's reservation on the consultation and information rights. There are two possible definitions of subsidiarity. The first is that subsidiarity means that a decision should be taken at the most local level possible. In this context, a decision would be whether it is desirable that companies above a certain size should inform their work force of major decisions affecting them. An alternative definition, which would perhaps be implied if we objected to this, would be that we would give a competitive disadvantage to companies that operate in more than one country. If a ruling is desirable for a company that operates in Broxtowe and Belfast, it is also desirable for a company that operates in Broxtowe and Dublin, so we should not attempt to draw an artificial distinction. In fact, the consultation that is proposed would be carried out by most employers as a matter of good practice. It is foolish to try to make major changes to a company without talking to the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the spirit of the Government's reservations and the vigilance with which they want to defend the principle of subsidiarity but, in this case, I want to urge them not to fight in the last ditch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a wide ranging and extremely positive debate. A range of issues have been raised, many of which go to the heart of the document. I give the Committee a commitment that I will take into account the comments that have been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
made, especially as proposals come forward. That will be helpful to the Committee, which can then call me to account. It is important to me, as a Minister, that in the debates that take place there is some continuity between what I say and what I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document belongs to the Commission. It was not put to the Council for endorsement at Luxembourg in October, nor will it be in future because it does not require Council endorsement. That is why the words of the motion are "takes note". Individual proposals from the Commission will, of course, require Council approval and adoption, at which point we shall exert our influence and keep the Committee fully informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to hon. Members' specific questions in a moment but, on general matters, I want to say that we agree with much of the programme. However, the Commission intends to consult on various issues before proposing specific measures—for example, its intention to consult social partners—and we look forward to that. We want to see the details of the consultation first and, in areas where we are content with the broad outlines of the actions proposed, we shall again want to see the details first. We want to ensure that proposals have a proper legal base and a proper budgetary authority. That is of critical importance.

I am prepared to write to the hon. Member for Daventry on the issue of subsidiarity. There was language in the Amsterdam protocol on subsidiarity and proportionality. With our European colleagues, we intend to ensure proper application of that in the social context. It is easy for me to tell the Committee to look up the Amsterdam protocol, but given the resources at my disposal, that is less than fair. If it helps the Committee, I shall send hon. Members a note on that.

It is important to understand that we are dealing with social security co-ordination, not harmonisation. The Community has a clear role to co-ordinate social security provisions to protect the rights to benefit of workers who move from country to country to work. We shall consider proposals to extend the regulations on their merits, but we do not see the need for the harmonisation of social security systems; and the Government would resist any such proposal. The posting of workers directive is important; it is part of a family of measures designed to protect the rights of workers who move around the Community—no more, no less. It provides co-ordination, not harmonisation.

I enjoy my discourses with the hon. Member for Daventry. I accept that as a Minister he was committed to the principle of training, but his problem was that he was a fish out of water in that Administration. The result on 1 May put him out of his misery—until he was invited back to the Front Bench. Since then, he has tried his best to weave his way through a minefield, an old Heathite trying to keep onside with the buccaneers of Thatcherism who sit beside him on the Front Bench. I congratulate him on being able to reach the end of that discourse and still be politically alive to fight another day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) characteristically asked some helpful questions about the single currency and manufacturing. In my opening statement and during questions, I dealt with manufacturing and a single currency—I realise where his interests lie on that matter.

In the previous Parliament, I tried from the Opposition Front Bench to effect a ban on advertising in the tobacco industry. The majority of Tory MEPs voted to maintain the tobacco production subsidy. The Government's clear political strategy is to cooperate with Europe on tobacco, preventing ill health and deterring people from using tobacco.

The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, who used to be a member of the Conservative party, is now a member of a sect—the "Independence for Ruislip-Northwood" sect. He never wavers from his total opposition to anything European. This morning, he even tried to pray in aid the trade unions—until my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Miss Smith) burst that bubble with her question about the minimum wage. I respect the hon. Gentleman's views, but I cannot agree with him.

My hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Mr. Twigg) spoke about best practice, partnership and engaging national responsibility—enabling national Governments to take responsibility for ensuring a better and more stable European society, while taking a co-ordinated approach across the European Union.

I like the hon. Member for West Dorset. I used to think that he was a frustrated economist. I now know that that is not so. He is in the wrong profession; he should be the manager of a treacle factory. He starts with a kernel of an idea, but 25 minutes later, he has lost it. I took the risk of trying to help the hon. Gentleman, talking with different partners with differing responsibilities, and taking resources to the table to bring them together, but I did not realise when I mentioned land reclamation that it would cause a crisis in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of the hon. Gentleman, I shall repeat my point about sub-regional economies. Many partners are involved at that level, and areas of involvement include infrastructure and land use. One should not infer from my comments that I said that the matter should be dealt with in the document. I said that we must co-ordinate and co-operate to improve employability and to enforce the key elements of the document, and that partnerships at the local level have to be established subsequently.

My hon. Friends the Members for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) and for South Thanet discussed social funding and spending. I can say, in advance of the social programme, that the Government's funding of local communities, which creates jobs and training, is second to none.

I heard what my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe said, but there cannot be a case for imposing on small companies that operate in their own labour market—or, indeed, nationally, regionally or subregionally—a structure for consultation or for the provision of information. We support the European works council directive, which relates to companies that operate across European boundaries in the single market. We hope that progress will be made on the European company statute, which will ensure that when companies come together to create a European entity there is a process for consulting the work force. We also want to ensure that directives about consultation and the provision of information apply equally across the Community. That is why we introduced the "Fairness at Work" White Paper. The United Kingdom labour market should involve partnership. The overriding philosophy of the White Paper is to promote partnership and co-operation with the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not against consultation or the provision of information, and we do not oppose the imposition of additional rent or the recognition of trade unions in the workplace. However, we sincerely believe that those matters should be decided by individual states, which will take into account the historical relationship between employers and unions in each member state and the relationship between the relevant company and proportionality. There are no grounds for arguing that such matters do not involve subsidiarity. Similar considerations are also advanced by other member states—we are not alone in making such arguments.

I hope that my remarks have been helpful to members of the Committee. I can think of nothing more that needs to be added. We have had a constructive debate this morning, and hon. Members put much thought into their contributions. However, much work remains to be done and I look forward to returning to the Committee for more enjoyable debates.

In the meantime, if the hon. Member for West Dorset does take over a treacle factory, could he send me some?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 8328/98, a Commission Communication on its proposed Social Action Programme for 1998–2000; supports the Government's view that the Programme rightly places jobs at the heart of its framework for action; and also supports the Government's intention to give due consideration to specific Commission proposals as they come forward.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Committee rose at two minutes to One o'clock.</i></p>
