	<div class='legislation'>Court of Auditors Report 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Minister, I wish to explain to the Committee that Mrs. Liddell has been unwell of late, so if she feels slightly dizzy during her speech or during questions afterwards I have suggested that she resume her seat. She also has a slight problem with her hearing, so hon. Members who wish to ask questions should do so in a clear voice, which will help the Committee. I am sure that the Minister will be grateful for that assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mrs. Winterton, as I am for the assistance of the Committee. I shall try hard not to do anything dramatic during my speech. It would not do to stir up the Committee too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the debate on the European Court of Auditors annual report and statement of assurance for the year 1996. Many of the matters that we shall be discussing today are technical, and I shall try to explain them as fully as I can. If I cannot find the relevant sections quickly, I guarantee to come back to such matters in my wind-up speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual report focuses on particular areas of expenditure selected by the court and analyses them in detail. The Court of Auditors adopts a testing approach to such matters. My explanatory memorandum sets out areas that the court has looked at for the year 1996. Sadly, the general themes of the report are depressingly similar to previous years: the failure to set objectives clearly in advance or to monitor whether they are being achieved; programmes that overlap or which fail to reach the intended beneficiaries; substantial overcompensation of farmers, in excess of real need; and the bunching of payments towards the end of the financial year in a manner that prejudices good financial management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should emphasise that, although the Court of Auditors investigates matters relating to fraud, most—but not all—of its criticisms relate to weaknesses in financial management and to weaknesses in the underlying policies rather than to fraud in the criminal sense. A few weeks ago, the Committee had a useful debate on enlargement proposals and we discussed financial management techniques use by the European Union, some of which could most politely be described as eccentric. We are agreed throughout the House that there is a real need for improvement in financial management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court presents its statement of assurance, introduced by the Maastrict treaty, for the third time. It has again certified accuracy of the accounts, but it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
has been unable to certify the legality and regularity of payment transactions. The central estimate of substantive errors is 5.4 per cent. While that is down slightly from the 5.9 per cent. of the previous year, I must say that it is not a good enough improvement; and the statistical techniques that are used as part of the exercises are such that the change is too small to be statistically significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 1996, the court tells us that the level of errors on agricultural expenditure is lower than the average, but that the errors on structural expenditure are above average. That indicates that the reforms of the common agricultural policy introduced in 1992 have brought about the expected reduction in fraud. Less money is paid in export refunds, an area particularly prone to large-scale fraud; and more money is paid directly to farmers for schemes where frauds are easier to detect. We want to encourage such changes in policy. In the long run, they will be a much more effective way of reducing fraud, as they will increase transparency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of errors on structural fund expenditure continues to be a major cause of concern. However, substantive errors do not necessarily mean fraud. Indeed, the vast majority of errors do not relate to fraud. Many errors are caused by genuine misunderstandings, which often stem from the underlying complexity of the regulations governing structural fund expenditure. It seems a matter of common sense to introduce structures with greater transparency, so we must focus more on improved policy-making and clearer regulations. I shall return to that subject when discussing the improvements to be made under the SEM2000 initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now say a little about procedure. Under the treaty, the report of the European Court of Auditors is considered first by the Council, which decides whether to recommend that the European Parliament should grant formal discharge to the Commission in respect of its stewardship of the 1996 budget, and what recommendations should be attached to that discharge. ECOFIN will consider the matter on 9 March. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will preside, and I shall occupy the UK national seat. Thereafter, probably in April, the European Parliament will consider whether to grant discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report relates to 1996—the last full EC budget year—which was the responsibility of the previous Government. As I explained to the Committee in previous debates, we launched an initiative in the intergovernmental conference as soon as we took office in order to strengthen treaty defences against fraud and waste in the EC budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to use the opportunity of the UK presidency to further those objectives, which I am sure the whole Committee will share. In that context, we are organising an ECOFIN discussion on 19 May that will consider all aspects of Community finance, including the preliminary draft budget for 1999; the longer term prospects for Community finance under Agenda 2000, particularly with enlargement in mind; the SEM2000
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
programme; and the fight aginst fraud. We shall cooperate fully with the Austrian presidency during the second part of the year, to take that forward as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that fraud is taken into account when policy is considered. Reported irregularities have dropped from £319 million in 1994 to £169 million in 1996, and that reduction should continue. We shall continue to support the SEM2000 programme, and we are most anxious to see improved control of spending, more than 80 per cent. of which is administered by individual member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have gone into more detail than the Committee wished. I am happy to answer as many questions as possible. If I cannot give a quick answer, I shall certainly give as full an answer as possible before the end of the sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind Members that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. Would it be possible to close the blind? The sun makes it impossible to see the Minister's face from this side of the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Could you do that, Dr. Palmer? Thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to hear that the Minister is not feeling very well—none of us feels terrible well after reading the report of the European Court of Auditors. Of course, we shall understand if she not on her usual robust form. Perhaps she will write to us about any questions that she cannot answer on the spot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that there is a depressing familiarity about many of these matters. Indeed, we are witnessing a systematic failure in European Union finance, which makes it all the more alarming that many of the weak areas receive more expenditure—double-figure percentage increases every year—despite the failures identified by the European Court of Auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are a month and a half into the United Kingdom presidency. The Minister and her colleagues told us in advance that financial weakness would be a key priority during our presidency. I should like the Minister to tell us more about the initiatives that she has launched. She has mentioned the ECOFIN discussion that will take place, but there is nothing new about ECOFIN discussions; they were a feature of the previous two Parliaments without dramatic progress being made. Will the Minister tell the Committee more about what she has done in the past month and a half to tackle the weaknesses identified in the report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, and I shall try to be reasonably robust in my responses. Indeed, the debate may even give me the boost that I need to recover my full health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We share the view that there are substantial problems in financial management in the European Union. It is not easy to try to turn round such structures. I pay tribute to the previous Government, who introduced a system whereby member states answer the criticisms made against them in the report of the European Court of Auditors. We must build on that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our presidency, we must consolidate the initiatives and programmes that are already in progress. One of our criticisms of the EU is that, whenever a difficulty is encountered, someone, as a great wheeze, dreams up a new initiative to deal with it. We want to develop current initiatives to ensure much greater financial prudence. Much work is going on in customs co-operation—for example, the transit action plan, the action plan against organised crime and getting Europol up and running. We want to use the discharge procedure to highlight the real concerns: over-budgeting, poor objective setting, over-complex legislation, little real evaluation of results—all of which make the budget susceptible to fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall work with the European Parliament, which shares our concerns. I have already met the European Parliament Budgets Committee. I am due to meet it again in a few weeks. All member states recognise that there must be absolute certainty about the finacial management of taxpayers' money. We must use the presidency to focus attention across the EU on that. We shall also work with other member states on the SEM 2000 initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious that anti-fraud matters be given full consideration in the Agenda 2000 discussions. That relates to a previous debate in this Committee. It is important that the European Court of Auditors should be able to give a signal about the quality of financial management that will be required of enlargement countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman referred to the ECOFIN discussion of 19 May. At that meeting, we will discuss member states' replies to the criticisms of the European Court of Auditors; that is the first time that that will be done. It will build on the previous Government's initiative in ensuring that member states are forced to reply to those criticisms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The auditors make a point of saying—as auditors tend to do—that their work is valuable, saves much money and so on. If we accept that, as seems reasonable, should we press for them to move on from their selective spot checks on programmes to a broader annual audit? Might that not be money well spent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. However, the scale of the auditors' task is such that the more selective approach is perhaps more manageable. The Court of Auditors must, as it acknowledges, constantly seek to upgrade its procedures. I met the members of the Court of Auditors at the end of last
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
year and I know that it wishes to improve its procedures so that it has a proper, wide-ranging audit. That will become more important as we enter the enlargement discussions, which will be an opportunity to help applicant states improve their procedures so that they are more amenable to existing auditing structures. The statement of assurance issued after the Maastricht treaty is an annual audit by statistical sampling and lends greater clarity to the criticisms of the Court of Auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the Minister, having recently partially recovered from the same disease. May I draw her attention to table MA on page 139 of the bulky document C348, volume 40.1, which deals with the implementation of the budget for structural measures? My question relates to issues that we have previously discussed in Committee and about which the Minister and I have corresponded. Am I right that, from the figures at the bottom of that table, there is approximately a 1.4 billion ecu gap between the appropriation and the payment implementation—the expenditure—on the structural funds in 1996?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no reason to believe that that is not correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary reassure us that the Government will examine fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy and not only the detailed problem of fraud? Does she agree that the problem of fraud could be overcome by such a reform?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a point that is close to my heart. We had lengthy discussions about that in the previous few sittings of the Committee. There has to be reform of the CAP, as my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has said on several occasions, as has my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. The Government, prefer payments to farmers to be fully decoupled from the production process. As we reform the CAP—as part of our enlargement discussions, we know that enlargement has to go in parallel with such reforms—we must learn lessons from what the European Court of Auditors is telling us about how policy instruments are structured and designed. We must develop policy instruments that ensure that a reformed common agricultural policy is less vulnerable to fraud; we must build that into the legislative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are examples of how such measures can be effective. The 1993 reforms to the common agricultural policy served to reduce reliance on export refunds and market support measures, including interventions, which are the areas that had been most commonly prone to fraud. The value of reported irregularities has fallen from a peak of £319 million in 1994 to £169 million in 1996. We must keep returning to that lesson as reform of the common agricultural policy develops further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report of the personal representatives group states that most replies by member states to the Court of Auditors' observations
	<br><blockquote><p>"were of a descriptive or defensive nature, and many questioned the possibility or even usefulness of changing existing practices".</p></blockquote>
Is the Economic Secretary confident that the United Kingdom was not one of the heel-draggers, so to speak? In general, is she satisfied that the Government are taking all necessary measures properly to respond to the Court of Auditors' criticisms of the United Kingdom, so that during the UK presidency we will have the moral right to raise the issue of compliance and combating fraud with our fellow member states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. If we had not been prepared to take seriously the criticisms of the United Kingdom contained in the report, we would have been on shaky ground in insisting on the ECOFIN discussion on 19 May. We have challenged a couple of the Court of Auditors' conclusions which were critical of the United Kingdom. One related to areas in Scotland designated for assistance, about which we had a fairly good case. The court claimed that the Scottish base area for aid for arable crops was understated, leading to an overshoot of expenditure. We dispute that; there was a split between the less favoured and the other areas, which had to be adjusted to reflect the actual situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom was the first member state to reply to criticisms; we have responded during the past two years. This year, member states have been asked to reply by 15 March, and we will ensure that we do so. We are confident—it is proven—that the Commission does not criticise the United Kingdom Government in the personal representatives group. It would be hypocritical of us to make such an issue of fraud and financial management if we were not prepared to do the utmost ourselves as a member state to ensure that we behave responsibly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next speaker, I give my permission for gentlemen to remove their jackets, if they feel warm—the Room is quite warm this morning—although I see that Dr. Palmer has jumped the gun.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend agree that the Court of Auditors' report shows clearly that the common agricultural policy reforms of 1992, which were much lauded by the previous Government, have failed? Does she also share my concern that, according to the Commission, policy for future reform of the CAP is to be based on the claimed successes of the 1992 reforms? Given the contents of the Court of Auditors' report into the 1992 reforms, the problems of enlargement and the seriousness and importance of the CAP in that regard, is not it time that the European Union set up a task force to examine in detail the fundamental problems of the CAP and its future reform?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what my hon. Friend says and I always bow to his considerable knowledge of such matters. I would not say that the 1992 reforms had failed; they have perhaps failed to live up to their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
billing and not been the sweeping panacea that we were led to expect. However, it is important to recognise that the reforms have gone in the right direction, if not far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of task forces already exist in the EU to consider such matters, and I do not think that much would be achieved by establishing another one, but my hon. Friend's message is important; we must use every opportunity to focus our attention and that of member states on these matters. A point to which I keep returning is the significance of all this in the context of enlargement. If we do not improve financial management now before the accession of other states, which have perhaps less sophisticated financial management structures than those that have been built up among existing member states, we shall compound the difficulties, which will merely add to the challenges of EU taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take my hon. Friend's point well, but we must have confidence in the structures that already exist and work to ensure that they are effective, rather than try to develop new ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Select Committee on European Legislation observed that the Government's response to the report of the personal representatives group is "disappointingly bland", which conflicts with the Minister's expressed priority for financial discipline measures. That should disturb the Committee. I believe that when weaknesses and problems of misallocation of funds are discovered with regard to expenditure of structural funds, a member state should suffer a direct financial penalty. I have always urged such action. Page 37, annex 9 of the report shows that the Austrian and German representatives observed that there is no adequate legal base for such a financial penalty. Clearly that must be put right. What has the Minister done during the British presidency about finding a legal base, so that defaulting member states will suffer a direct penalty when funds are misapplied?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Committee felt that the explanatory memorandum was bland; our intention was not to overhype the issue. The memorandum is only part of a series of responses. It would be wrong—indeed, it would mislead the Committee—if we were to say that we had the solution to all the problems of financial management in our grasp. It would be wrong to overstate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman referred to member states being penalised for failing in their financial management of structural funds. I do not want to introduce controversy into the debate, but the way in which the system of structural funds financing was put together does not make for easy and sound financial management. The structure agreed by the previous Government builds in a system of targets rather than ceilings for structural fund expenditure. As we are about to enter new negotiations on structural funds,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
we will have the opportunity to address that problem. Indeed, the British Government will insist on discussing the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much progress on direct financial penalties has been made to date. The United Kingdom Government believe that there is an adequate legal base for penalties, although we understand that some member states disagree, as the right hon. Gentleman said, when he referred to the report of the personal representatives group. We shall certainly do our best to strengthen the position as we go into the next phase of developing new financial regulations in the next few months. We must learn from what has happened in the past and build on that for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As we have only another half an hour for questions, it might be worth remembering that if questions and answers are brief, we shall get through more questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall quote from paragraph 0.2 of the 	<i>Official Journal of the European Communities,</i> volume 40, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A generous allocation of budgetary appropriations may create pressure for expenditure or at the very least. discourage rigorous financial management."</p></blockquote>
I think that that is just a fancy way of saying that the more money someone has, the more likely he is to throw it around. I can suggest a simple solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from my experience of objective 2 funding that money is given for an allocated period—usually three years—and it has to be spent within that time. As one reaches the end of the three-year period, one looks around for things to do with the money, so as not to lose it. Therefore, if the three-year spending period were simply made a target and the organisations responsible for distributing the money were given the freedom to go over that target if necessary, having been told that it was more appropriate to spend properly than quickly, many of the pressures referred to in the Court of Auditors report would go away. Have the Government given any thought to that suggestion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I crave the Committee's indulgence and remain seated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend makes an important point, which is worthy of consideration. As I said earlier, we are about to embark on a new system of analysis of financial regulation and we shall learn lessons from past experience. My hon. Friend summed up the problem perfectly when he said that the more money one has, the more one spends. I am concerned about the system of multi-annual expenditure with set targets. It does not lead to effective financial management, which is a matter that we continually prosecute with other member states and the Commission. We are worried about that system and we shall be concentrating on it in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to ask for an extension of a further two years, but that in itself is not a sound means of budgetary control. If one knows that a knight on a

white charger will arrive with additional expenditure to dig one out of a hole, the less pressure there is to be prudent in assessing future programmes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Minister's attention to table III.2 on page 140 of document C 348? The allocations for structural measures in the six-year period 1994–99 are about 145 billion ecu, whereas the 1994–96 three-year period payments are about 47 billion ecu. Am I right in thinking that if the payments went on at the current rate for three more years, there would be a gap of about 50 billion ecu between the allocations and payments across the six-year period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take the hon. Gentleman's point on a superficial level, that would be the case. However, it would not be possible to extrapolate from one year and assume that that will be the basis of expenditure over subsequent years. Expenditure goes in peaks and troughs according to when projects come on stream and when applications are made for projects. As I told my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), it points to the weaknesses of the multi-annual budget approach when there are huge surges and then dips in expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be better if we had a more coherent system of budgetary allocation as well as project allocation. All of us with experience of voluntary organisations know that sometimes there is a tendency when faced with a pot of money to dream up wheezes to allow its expenditure. I think that we are currently experiencing such a phenomenon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much concern has been expressed at the comments of the Court of Auditors that money has been wasted on unnecessary compensation schemes in certain areas of the CAP. Would my hon. Friend like to comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we discussed enlargement at an earlier Committee sitting, we said that the matter gives rise to considerable concern. It is one reason why there must be widespread reform of the common agricultural policy and a much greater focus on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister agrees that the report makes depressing reading. I expect that she knows from previous reports that the situation has been going on for years. The difficulty is not identification of the problems, because many of them have been identified, but enforcement. Are the Government considering making proposals at ECOFIN or during the presidency that would give the Court of Auditors greater powers of enforcement in respect of the Commission, for example, in the event of its failing to address the problems that were identified in the report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue was discussed by the Government within weeks of our being elected—indeed, it was taken on board when my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister went to the Amsterdam Council. We must continually review the powers of the European Court of Auditors and its effectiveness in encouraging member states. A package of proposals was put together in Amsterdam, which will mean that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
anti-fraud measures can be adopted on the basis of qualified majority voting, which allows for much quicker and clearer action in support of the ECA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also seen measures that will clarify and strengthen the powers of the European Court of Auditors. For the first time, under article 205, member states have to co-operate with the Commission to ensure sound financial management of Community funds. Structures can be put in place to encourage member states to improve their financial management, but there is another, more pressing need for them to improve their financial management, because such structures cost money. If the EU is to be an international competitive organ, it must be responsible for its expenditure and for its performance in a way that is efficient and effective. That cannot be achieved overnight, but we must consistently work towards that aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that four-fifths of expenditure is through nation states, not through the Commission, and that that is where sound financial management is needed. Does she not agree that we urgently need the ratification of the Amsterdam treaty, which highlights the need for greater powers of the Court of Auditors and the extension of qualified majority voting to tackle the nation states where sound financial management is least widespread?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just referred to the important conclusions reached in Amsterdam. There is no doubt about the Government's enthusiasm and determination not only in respect of such changes, but to go further and to acknowledge in the structures of the rules and regulations developed by the EU an intention to effect sound financial mnagement and the fight against fraud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her reply to the hon. Member for South Thanet and to my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), the Minister acknowledged the need for budgetary discipline and recognised the risk of money being spent simply because it is there. In the light of those comments and in reference to the final paper before us, the proposal for transfer of appropriations, would the Minister agree that there is a risk that the transfer of money to expenditure that was not included in the original budget is just such an example of money being spent because it is there? Will the British Government resist that proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unclear about what proposal the hon. Gentleman is saying we should resist: can he amplify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know if I can tell the Minister before her officials do; it is document No. 59/97, entitled "Transfer of Appropriations (Structural Funds)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Committee that projects financed from the underspend on community initiatives are subject to the same requirements for appraisal, monitoring and evaluation as all other structural fund projects. The hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting that we oppose the discharge, but that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
would not be logical; it would essentially be saying, "We are taking our ball home—we are not playing any more." The way to ensure the sort of improvements that we want is to work with member states and the Commission to develop effective structures. I may have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman; he seems to be signifying that I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister assure us that all the national Governments of the EC are as determined as the British Government to tackle the problems identified in the papers before us? Nothing undermines the institutions of the EC and the EC itself more than the belief that while we are doing our bit, others are not as keen to do theirs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point, but it is a bit like asking someone whether he has stopped beating his wife. It is unlikely that any member state will be prepared to say that it will not implement sound financial management—a concept that is almost as revered as motherhood and apple pie. We have to ensure that all member states implement it with the same rigour as we would ourselves. It is therefore vital that the meeting on 19 May of the Council of Finance Ministers, which brings together the Community's senior Finance Ministers, will highlight that matter. We have encountered much fellow feeling among other member states on that; with prompting from our Government, member states have responded to the criticisms in the report of the European Court of Auditors. Last year, 11 of the 12 member states affected by the report responded to it and this year we look forward to as full a response; member states have two or three weeks left in which to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to tax the Minister unduly in her current condition, but she may not have understood the full purport of the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). If she looks at document No. 59/97 and paragraph 9 of the explanatory memorandum, it is clear that when the Commission's proposal for the transfer of appropriations was considered at meetings of the Council's budget committee on 1 and 4 December last year, a qualified majority agreed that the Council should deliver a favourable opinion to the European Parliament. I have to admit that I do not fully understand the legislative process for the transfer of appropriations—it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us something about that--but it is clear from the documentation that a qualified majority voted in favour of some kind of approval. It would therefore be interesting to know whether the British Government also voted in favour of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain how transfers work—perhaps I missed that point in the earlier question. The transfer is the usual procedure for adjusting details of European Union spending. It can involve large sums, but it is necessary given the detailed way in which the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
EU budget is organised under specific objective headings. If transfers were not allowed, the overall budget ceiling would be higher because one would be trying to vire money from other sources, so the United Kingdom Government did not vote against those procedures. Even in domestic finance, there is often a need for various year-end adjustments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a point of information, the transfer referred to—if I am talking about the same one—was over 50 per cent. at the request of the United Kingdom, so it is relatively unlikely that we would have opposed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 7.17 of volume 1 of the 	<i>Official Journal of the European Communities,</i> attention is drawn to the fact that in Britain, unlike in many countries, the social partners—employers and employees—are not involved in monitoring the social fund and that the quality of projects would improve if local employers and trade unions were to support such projects. I realise that the previous Government's policy on social partners was like Count Dracula's policy on cloves of garlic—to avoid them. Do not the Government take a more favourable view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's question is apposite because, earlier this year, the Government announced that the involvement of the social partners—the employer and employee representatives—in structural funds would be for the individual monitoring committees to encourage in whatever manner seemed to be most valuable. The Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress have agreed to nominate representatives to sit on the national monitoring committees. The Government are committed to partnership, and that is an important way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary has explained a little about the transfer of appropriation of structural fund money. Why was the special programme for Ireland underspent and why, therefore, was expenditure switched away from Ireland to other areas of expenditure? Could not the Government have put more effort into correcting any prospective underspend in Ireland given the evident needs of the peace process, rather than allowing that money to be switched into other areas at a late date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a difficult question for me to answer, given that the Government in question was that of the right hon. Gentleman. I do not know what was in their mind at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only assume that there is a question of phasing of expenditure—not all projects come on stream at the same time. Indeed, the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) referred to that matter in the Northern Ireland Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I counsel my hon. Friend not to be too beguiled by the protestations of Conservative Members, given their record on transfer of appropriations, which some of us might refer to during
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
the debate. I want to turn my hon. Friend's attention to the income side of the equation. Will she comment on the criticism in the Court of Auditors report of abuse in the system of preferences for imports from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and on the stern criticism of the operation of the free-port system, especially at Tilbury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even in my weakened state, I reassure my hon. Friend that I am not likely to be beguiled by anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked about the operation of the Tilbury zone, which is specifically referred to in the ECA report. The Tilbury free zone and the other UK free zones allow the common storage of Community and non-Community goods. We recognise that they do not fully comply with the Community customs code. We operate the free zones to facilitate trade and to allow the effective use of customs resources. The Commission recognises that as an appropriate means of modern customs control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware of the Commission's study of EC free zones and that it recognises the need for the modernisation of legislation. We support proposals to change the Community customs code so that customs authorities can control free zones using modern audit-based techniques and risk analysis rather than the traditional controls, which seem to involve counting large numbers of containers in a way probably most suited to the middle ages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the changes come into force, which is expected to be on 1 January 1999, free zones can be operated on a regime basis simultaneously with the normal operations of the port. In view of that change in the law, the UK will not be modifying its existing operating procedures to comply with the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my hon. Friend's first question, the United Kingdom favours suspending preferential agreements when third countries fail to respect the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his question to the Economic Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset drew my attention to the fact that the transfer of appropriations was the subject of a vote on 4 December. It was approved by a qualified majority. Can the Minister explain why, according to the Select Committee papers, the proposal was apparently not deposited in Parliament until 23 December?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give an answer at the moment. I shall have inquiries made and answer when I reply to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend hope to see some short-term improvements? Many of the things mentioned this morning are longer term and will require time, but we need some action now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am impressed with the enthusiasm with which Commissioners Liikanen and Gradin have approached the matter. My meetings with the budgetary committee of the European Parliament and with the Court of Auditors reasssures me that all possible attention is being given to the question. The meeting of ECOFIN in May is important as it will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
concentrate the minds of senior Finance Ministers on the question. Concentrating attention at member-state level is important for the future, as it will allow due emphasis to be given to projects such as SEM2000 and will help get projects such as Europol up and running. We can never be complacent—there are no prizes for that. We must maintain pressure throughout.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her earlier answer to me, the Minister said that enforcement costs money. Tackling fraud also costs money. In volume 0, page 18 of the draft general budget for 1998, in the general summary of appropriations for 1997–98, appears the heading
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consumer protection, internal market. industry and trans-European networks".</p></blockquote>
The line detailing fraud-line B5-9—suggests that the appropriation for combating fraud has gone down from 19.9 million ecu in 1997 to 4.4 million ecu in 1998. Does the Minister have an explanation for that reduction? Can she give any reason for my not being concerned that there will now be even less money to tackle fraud?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter to which we have returned several times, and which was raised during our annual debate on the European budget. Much anti-fraud work must be done in co-operation with individual member states, so it does not involve direct Commission expenditure. The important thing is to ensure that individual member states concentrate their attention on the fight against fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also understand that we are probably approaching the end of a programme of computerisation and training. I cannot draw simple conclusions from one line in the budget concerning expenditure on fraud, but the substantive issue is the role of individual member states in combating fraud and being vigourous in its pursuit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While following the debate during the past 20 minutes or so, I looked carefully through the papers, but was unable to read everything. In my browsing, I have not been able to find any reference to levels of fraud in individual member states. Is not it possible that fraud is focused in a few member states where corruption is, shall we say, not uncommon and much more extensive than it is in the United Kingdom? Is not my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary concerned that there may be an unwarranted shift of budgetary payments from countries such as Britain, where we have greater integrity in our public and private finances, to other countries? Given that money is spent at national level through national and local governments, and that inspection is performed by nationals of the states concerned, can we be certain that the Court of Auditors has integrity? That may be a controversial question, but it is worth asking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to answer my hon. Friend's first point. We must always be careful not to say that we are good at prosecuting fraud and sound in our attitude to such matters, but that people from other countries do not have our high standards. I could not conceivably follow that line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
None of us in the room could put our hand on our heart and say that we are totally confident that there are no examples of fraud under way in our country. The nature of fraud means that it is difficult to detect, so we must be cautious about pursuing such a line. Some member states are making real efforts in relation to fraud, sometimes involving dramatic circumstances. We must ensure that we are not unnecessarily critical of other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to ensure that we develop Community regulations and structures that do not make fraud easier. The more complex the structures, the easier it is for those who want to defraud the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend find it slightly depressing that we have heard three questions from Conservative Members challenging the allocation of £117 million to training for the unemployed in Britain, which formed a substantial part of the transfer of appropriations? On pure accounting grounds, together with a general antipathy to European expenditure, Conservative Members appear to consider such expenditure regrettable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try not to be tempted down that line, but I may return to it during my summing-up speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is about tobacco expenditure. The European Court of Auditors observes that most Community tobacco remains of low quality, and that serious deficiencies in member states' implementation of the so-called reforms have been identified by the Commission. It makes several other damaging observations about the 1 billion ecu annual expenditure on the tobacco regime. In the debate on next year's budget, the hon. Lady said the Government would be voting against that expenditure in the agriculture Council. Can she bring us up to date with what the Government have done to end, if possible, and certainly to control wasteful expenditure on low-quality tobacco, which is dumped on third-world countries because it is too carcinogenic to be smoked in the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of Official Journal No. C348 of 18 November 1997. the Annual Report and Statements of Assurance of the European Court of Auditors concerning the financial year 1996. on activities financed from the general budget and of the sixth and seventh European Development Funds, together with the Institutions' replies: and of European Commission Document No. SEM 2000/3(97) Doc. 5. the 	<i>SEM 2000 Stage Ill Second Report on the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Personal Representatives Group on Sound Financial Management</i>: and endorses the Government's determination to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent efficiently

and effectively in the EC budget. and welcomes the priority which the current British Presidency of the EU is giving to this subject.—(	<i>Mrs. Liddell.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary for the way in which she answered questions. I agree with her comment about the negative questions that came from Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report, which is one of a long line of Court of Auditors reports stretching over many years, makes grim reading. What almost leaps out from it is the lack of urgency in the Commission's responses to the important issues that it raises. They can almost be described as mechanistic. My hon. Friend may want to comment on that in her winding-up speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The responses reflect a deliberate attitude taken by the Commission. The present system, especially the transfer of appropriations, gives the Commission enormous political powers and I am sure that evidence is building up to lead one to that conclusion. I should also welcome my hon. Friend's comments on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make four points that I hope will assist my hon. Friend in her historic task of getting to grips with the massive amorphous edifice of European Union financial structures. I refer first to the financial perspectives. Earlier, reference was made to the first page of the report headed "Budgetary Management". I do not claim to have special knowledge of Court of Auditors' reports, but this is the first time I can recall a report bringing financial perspectives into question. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A general allocation of budgetary appropriations may create pressure for expenditure or at the my least, discourage rigorous financial management."</p></blockquote>
I stand to be corrected, but that is the first time that such a statement has appeared in a Court of Auditors report. It brings into serious question the system of financial perspective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make sure that the record of our proceedings reads correctly. the hon. Gentleman cited a most important passage from paragraph 0.2 of the report and quoted the words "a general allocation". He should have read, "A generous allocation".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing that to my attention. I was about to conclude my remarks on the matter with that very point. The report cannot be interpreted as anything other than a criticism of the financial perspectives, — which are too generous and have been—as the record shows—too generous for the past few years, since they were established by the previous Government. The perspectives have been seen as targets, not as a financial control. In other words, they are there and one spends up to them; if one does not, that is okay because one is still within them. Ergo —everything in the garden is lovely. The Commission has deliberately fostered that ethos over the years. That has suited it well. In case I am accused of gratuitously criticising the Commission or of singling it out, I repeat my belief
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
that it is an organisation that is singularly lacking in definitive methods of accountability. The report therefore points out, as far as I know for the first time, that our financial perspectives can no longer be justified, even if they could be when they were first established. Action to tackle that significant problem is therefore long overdue and needs to be undertaken urgently.

My second point is about the CAP. My hon. Friend the Minister was good enough to respond to a question I asked earlier about the 1992 reforms. The report goes into detail about them, particularly in regard to arable land, which was the object of the CAP reforms. We were told in July 1992 by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), the then Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, that the reforms were good for the farmer, the taxpayer and the consumer. If we use those criteria as a framework for our reading of the report, we would be hard put to come to any other conclusion than that the reforms have failed. My hon. Friend the Minister said that while she did not agree that the reforms had failed, she believed that they had failed to meet their objectives. I should be grateful for clarification of that. It is clear from the report that the Court of Auditors has grave concerns about what has happened since 1992 and about the future. Do we need to be convinced further?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report states that between 1992 and 1996, CAP expenditure increased by 25 per cent. on payments and 31 per cent. on commitments. The average annual increase was more than 10 per cent. Overcompensation was built into the system—which was agreed by the previous Government—particularly in the arable, beef and veal sectors. The overcompensation between 1992 and 1996, taking BSE into account, is estimated in the arable sector alone to have been some 3 billion ecu: a huge amount of money that was built into the system. I suspect that we are heading down the road of further CAP reforms, based on what the Commission claims are the successes of the 1992 reforms, although the report of the Court of Auditors is the first realistic evidence that we can use to assess what happened between 1992 and 1996 as a result of those reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report is damning. What the Commission has to say about the savings resulting from the 1992 reforms in the arable sector of agriculture—the main change—is hardly encouraging. The report of the Court of Auditors states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission also predicted a decrease in total arable crop expenditure in 1997. Whether this will occur remains to be seen."</p></blockquote>
A ringing endorsement indeed, after an in-depth study by the Court of Auditors into the changes that the previous Government told us would be good for the taxpayer, good for the farmer, and good for the consumer. Hence my point about a task force. If we accept the Commission's bland assumption that the 1992 reforms were successful, and try to take those reforms forward to 2000, future Members of Parliament will be sitting in this Room early in the next century saying exactly the same as us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
Member states have the prime responsibility of ensuring that the financial regulations are effectively enforced. That obviously varies from member state to member state. However, unless we can ensure a much-improved system of monitoring and enforcement by member states, the pressure to introduce a centralised system, based in Brussels at enormous expense, will be overwhelming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not so much that the system is not being effectively implemented and regulated by member states. That is serious enough, but unless member states—Britain under a Labour Government can give a lead—are prepared to take some action to put that unacceptable situation right, the Commission will propose to centralise, imposing a blanket enforcement organisation on the whole of the EU. The Commission is adept at doing that, especially the transferring of resources referred to by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1986–87, the previous Government chose to create a 10-month year in response to a financial crisis in the EU. Other hon. Members may remember that—I see the hon. Member for West Dorset nodding. The Opposition talk about financial manipulation and manoeuvring, and make implied criticisms of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. I caution Opposition Members, because their record of financial manoeuvring would form a nice basis for a Walt Disney film. In 1986–87, the Government wiped out two months' expenditure and transferred it to the following year. That was a massive transfer of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those points will be taken on board by my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. We all regard it as an extremely important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I start—unusually for me—by thanking the Government for the completeness of the documentation. I say that because we have previously argued about the adequacy of the information given to the Committee. Indeed, the documentation is over-complete, as I have two copies of the explanatory memorandum, so anxious was the Treasury to ensure that we had everything that we should have. I mention that because it is a serious point—the House of Commons only intermittently debates such matters and we rely heavily on receiving timely and complete documentation. Having said that, I hope that the Treasury will consider that much of this paper might be better predigested for the convenience and use of members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I see that Table creaking under the weight of piles of documentation, I wonder whether our problem is not too little information but the fact that it is not presented in a user-friendly form. I put that to the Minister in a non-partisan spirit because perhaps we also failed to appreciate how difficult it is for members of the Committee, who attend these debates once or twice a year, to get to grips with the intricacies of such expenditure. Given that the European Union
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
budget is about 90 becu—a lot of money—both the Government and the House need to consider how better to engage such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Government are giving priority to the struggle to enforce financial discipline and to counter mismanagement and fraud, but so far, the Minister has been disappointing in outlining the new initiatives that we had hoped for during the British presidency. I hope that she will say more about that in her winding-up speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this matter will dominate the ECOFIN meeting of 19 May, but it is not a new initiative. We need to hear not how the Minister is carrying on initiatives begun in earlier years or by other members states during their presidency but what she and the Government are doing to give renewed urgency and vigour to this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This European Court of Auditors report is extremely damaging. I am familiar with such reports. When I was in the Minister's position, I also read them with mounting despair. Frankly, if such a report were published on a public company, the directors would probably go to prison. There is a scandalous misapplication of public money, which is raised from the people whom we represent. Our net contribution to the European Union budget is on average—it fluctuates greatly—£2.5 billion a year, which is almost £7 million pounds a day, so we have a great national interest in ensuring that that money is spent properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a criticism but an observation, given that the Minister will have inherited many of the figures, but we are increasing expenditure in the very areas to which the most savage criticism is directed. For example, trans-European network expenditure will increase by 26 per cent. next year. Given the observations of the Court of Auditors, that must be explained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Tyrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the size of the gross contributions make the appropriate allocation of funds all the more pressing? It is the gross contribution that is being misused and, in some cases, fraudulently spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a unanswerable point. We should look at our gross contribution, which is about £6.5 billion a year. Our gross daily contribution to Brussels remains about £18 million. Things are seen differently in other member states, of course. If this debate were taking place in Madrid, we would be congratulating ourselves on receiving about 22 million ecu by way of structural and cohesion funds—the figure comes from a parlimentary answer. Somewhat smaller sums go to other member states. For example, Portugal receives about 10 million ecu a day, Greece 9 mecu and the Republic of Ireland 4 mecu. Those are very large sums, which inevitably colour the debate in each national Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the United Kingdom is a very big gross and net contributor, I hope that in future we will give more attention to the question of whether it is wise to go on increasing, by double figure percentages every year,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
expenditure on cohesion funds, structural funds, trans-European networks and so on, given the persistent criticisms of the European Court of Auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cut in anti-fraud expenditure was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie). I concede the point that the Economic Secretary has made before—that much of the fraud takes place in other member states. I listened carefully to some of the interesting observations made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson). He is right to say that if the problem is not tackled adequately, the pressure will grow for a sort of European Union police force to do the job for us. That would be extraordinarily controversial, but it is perhaps inevitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 20 per cent. of the European budget is under the direct control of the Commission. We note that some of its expenditure on measures to combat fraud is falling. In order to counter fraud in, for example, consumer protection, the internal market, industry and trans-European networks, expenditure has fallen from 19.9 million ecu to 4.4 million ecu, which is a dramatic cut. The hon. Lady should tell us whether she is satisfied with that cut and say whether she raised the matter in the budget Council, which she attended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The personal representatives group is an important initiative in which we put considerable hope. An issue that caught my eye which, although trailed before, never made much progress, is that member states should be directly penalised when they are caught misapplying structural funds. That is the only language they understand. Of course, that measure will be resisted by some member states. In paragraph 4.7.7.iii, of SEM 2000, the Spanish representative states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fact that the controls are ineffective is no reason for making financial corrections".</p></blockquote>
The term "financial corrections" is a euphemism for financial penalties. Thus if a member state has spent the money in a way that was not allowed for, apparently no penalty should be levied on that member state. A member state receiving 22 million ecu a day would think that, but that should not be the attitude of the north European states, which by and large are the net contributors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the obervations of the Austrian and German representatives who did not seem to be criticising the concept of financial correction, but were worried about the absence of a legal base. I share that concern. I believe in a Community based on the rule of law; if the legal base is inadequate, we must not forget that fact but propose an adequate one. The Economic Secretary said that in her view there is a proper legal base for proceeding in such a way. If so, what progress has been made in implementing such a procedure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The six months of the British presidency present a golden opportunity for us, together with our allies in the German and Austrian Governments—and probably elsewhere—to insist that where expenditure comes off the rails we do not administer a slap on the wrist or attempt to clear up the mess but turn off the tap. Member states caught out in that way might begin
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
to put in place the better financial controls that I, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South and others believe to be essential. I hope that the Economic Secretary will address that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already cited the observation of the Select Committee that the Government's response so far to the report of the group of personal representatives has been somewhat bland. I shall not speak for much longer, because I know that other hon. Members want to participate in the debate, but we must raise the question of the transfer of appropriations. The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) suggested that we were wrong to concentrate on a rather trivial sum of money, given the size of the European budget, but it is by focusing on specific items that we find out what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is symptomatic of the whole culture of the European Union's institutions that when there is a prospective underspend, the instinct is not to keep the money back until it is safe to spend it, but to think, "Let's get rid of the money somewhere else." The culture of expenditure must stop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify my point, I did not mean to suggest that we should not concern ourselves with sums of money of such an order. My point was that the transfer was overwhelmingly beneficial to the United Kingdom, and that it would therefore be cutting off our nose to spite our face if we were to object to it purely on accountancy grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I was making a wider point. It is wrong to approach such issues purely with the attitude that because a particular item of expenditure happens to benefit the United Kingdom, the procedure must be valid. There are wider lessons to be learnt, and even if it benefits the United Kingdom in the short term, it is wrong for us to assent to a system that switches expenditure in order to spend money in any one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that the United Kingdom will receive some of the additional expenditure under objective 3, that is at the expense of expenditure on Ireland. We must ask why the Government did not try to find ways to spend the money in Ireland, given its special needs, but rather switched it to structural funding elsewhere in the United Kingdom. We want to get at the culture behind such practices. Given that some member states apparently voted against the switch of expenditure, it would be useful to know which did so, and on what grounds. Is the only reason that we did not vote against it that we happened to be beneficiaries in this case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked a question about tobacco which the Economic Secretary did not have time to answer. It is symptomatic that the European Court of Auditors' report makes damaging observations about expenditure, as it has in the past, but that nothing gets done about it. I am quite prepared to criticise what the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Government did during my time in office; I can tell the Committee that tried. However, it must worry the Committee that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Court continues to question whether direct subsidies (amounting to more than five times the market value of production) constitute the best form of support for tobacco growers."</p></blockquote>
It is staggering that growers are receiving five times the value of what they produce—low-grade tobacco that has to be burnt or dumped on unfortunate smokers in other parts of the world. It is a terrible indictment of the system that we spend God knows how much trying to persuade people to stop smoking because of the cancer risk while spending 1 billion ecu a year—much of which comes from Britain—to subsidise tobacco. Nothing ever gets done about it. The Court of Auditors says regularly that not only is that questionable in principle, but that the way in which it is done invites fraud and mismanagement. In a nonpartisan spirit, I ask the Minister to report on her progress in that regard, particularly as she said that the Government intend to vote against that expenditure when it is debated in the Agriculture Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Wells made a good point about the weight of paperwork before us—as he said, there is so much of it that it is making the table creak. When I see documentation of such size, I get the feeling that someone is trying to hide something from me. I suspect that that is the case throughout the reports. That suspicion should give weight to the Government's resolve to tackle the problem—I congratulate them on that and assure them of my full support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The style and the content of the documents are so complex that it is almost impossible to understand them. Dipping into them at random, one encounters such statements as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of ensuring exhaustive and efficient follow-up, the Financial Regulation stipulates that a debt estimate must be entered in the accounts, after the Financial Controller's approval has been given, for any measure or situation likely to give rise to or modify a debt. and thus any reservation. This constitutes a preliminary stage"</p></blockquote>
and so it goes on. It is tosh. The paragraph is trying to say merely that when someone owes us money, we must collect it. Why it cannot be expressed in language that everyone can follow, I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A complex labyrinth of such enormity is bound to create problems. Complexity is the enemy of management and the friend of fraud and the sooner the Commission realises that and starts dealing with it, the sooner we will be able to grapple with some of the problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
problems and provide us with the simplified, effective management that we need. As president of the European Union for the next few months, it is up to us to drive that forward and create a sense of urgency. The Minister said that that is what she wants to do and I support her fully in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that the report states that if one throws money at a problem, it is easy to waste that money. That made me think of the Commission as one of those American movie stars whom one sometimes reads about, who gets good service at a gas station and gives the attendant enough money as a tip to buy a Cadillac. That is mirrored by some of the problems we have witnessed. One problem that has never been addressed is that of probity within the monitoring organisations—not only in Britain but throughout Europe—that have to distribute the money. Those in the monitoring organisation in an objective 1 or objective 2 area tend to have far more power than elected councillors. They have a sum of money they are accountable to nobody and they make decisions about how the money is to be distributed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who are part of such organisations are usually chosen from among the great and the good of the local community—the private sector, the voluntary sector and so on. They are important people and are usually well meaning, but they are also the very people who are responsible for spending the money in the community. I know of a private sector organisation that put together a project to be funded by money from the European Union, whose representatives were members of the monitoring committee that made decisions on expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My colleagues and I at Thanet council prepared a submission to the Committee on Standards in Public Life saying that the same codes of practice should be imposed on the behaviour of people on the monitoring organisations as we would expect of local councils. I received a bland reply that implied that it was not necessary for people to declare an interest and to excuse themselves when they were making decisions about money that they would spend. I considered that to be wholly inappropriate and I think that the Government should look into such matters. I am sure that they could become a problem in this country, as throughout the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate the fact that complexity is bound to lead to poor management practice, to funding going astray and to poor-quality decisions being made. It hides fraud and allows deception on all sorts of levels. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will clarify the fact that the Government intend to create a much more simple way of identifying the projects that we want to spend money on, and monitoring the objectives of those projects. If that happens, we will have gone a long way to resolving the problem, and perhaps future European Standing Committees will not have to wade through nine inches of documentation to gain a few facts, such as the knowledge that the European Union is owed two billion ecu and needs to collect it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in slightly uncharted territory, in that I agree almost entirely with all that has been said this morning. That leads me to the conclusion that I drew at our previous sitting—that there is far more that unites us than divides us. There is a distinctly British view on the matter of fiscal and budgetary probity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot claim to have the long experience of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, or indeed that of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South, of examining reports of the European Court of Auditors. I confess that this is the first time that I have looked in great detail at such a report. My initial reaction to it was almost one of disbelief. It reads like a catalogue of fraud, incompetence and abuse. The Minister was a little complacent in suggesting that there was rather less by way of fraud and rather more by way of incompetence. The line between them is fine, but we should be wary of assuming the best of all parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report is the third qualified audit in a row that the European Community has received. I have heard much rhetoric about the poor quality of monitoring and spending within the European Union and about waste and fraud. But we are talking not only about the rhetoric of people who are outside the institution and who are hostile to it, but about weaknesses identified by those who are intimately involved with the institution. Weaknesses have been identified many times over many years but, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South said, they have not been addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Five basic weaknesses are identified in the report. At the Commission level, there is poor budgeting, poor management of financial perspectives, and a failure to set effective objectives. There is also an under-utilisation of commitments, which leads to an historic build-up of unspent commitments; a lack of effective mechanisms for adjustments, which leads to regular and repeated over-compensation in the agricultural spending sector; and a lack of attention to the availability of co-financing when financial perspectives and budgets are set, which results in money remaining unspent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other weakness at the Commission level include a lack of attention to the absorption ability of the various member states, so that money goes unspent simply because it is too much for the institution or member state in question to deal with; and weak discipline in monitoring what has been budgeted for allocations and expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second weakness to be identified is poor outcome evaluation. For intermediated spending—spending carried out by member states on behalf of the EU—little is done to identify the ultimate beneficiaries or the final outcome of that spending, which is 80 per cent. of the total. The report states that the use of funds at final beneficiary level is unclear. That is a shocking statement. Money is considered by the EU to be spent—to be a line of budget expenditure—when it is dispersed to the intermediary organisation or member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
state, but it could stay there for some time. There seems to be no effective mechanism to monitor its end use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third weakness relates to poor targeting of the Commission's direct spending. The report draws attention to the poor construction of programmes intended to benefit small and medium-sized businesses and says that such programmes are not accessible to the end user.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, at the level of the member state, collection weaknesses have been identified, member states failing adequately to collect the own-resources element of the Community's budget. There is non-uniformity. I recognise the case for not imposing a uniform system across the EU, but it will be a cause for concern if the practices in different member states are so diverse that they are seen to give rise to unequal and unfair outcomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that there is substantial outright fraud, particularly in dealing with preferential imports. I respectfully suggest to the Economic Secretary that although much of that fraud is conducted at the individual level—I accept that such individuals are to be found as much in the United Kingdom as elsewhere—the key question is the extent to which member state Governments collude in that fraud. It seems that it may be regarded as a legitimate accretion of income and wealth to a member state, a blind eye being turned to practices that should not be tolerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggested that member states collude. Did the Conservative Government never spot that problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not seek to score party-political points. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said that he did not seek to claim that previous Administrations were blameless. In the consensual spirit of our debate, we all recognise that it is an ongoing and difficult problem, and we wish the Government well in tackling it. It is in that spirit that we make our remarks. We recognise that the Government's attempt to tackle those abuses is at an early stage. I hope that the Minister can reassure us about her commitment to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the Court of Auditors report that there is no effective audit of the final distribution of funds in member states and no effective monitoring of whether co-financing has been provided, nor of whether funds have been spent in accordance with the principle of additionality. From my observations—I have no evidence—I suspect that the commitment to compliance with the spirit of additionality and co-financing is stronger in some countries than in others, and that is putting it mildly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a feeling, especially in areas that receive substantial structural funds, that the European Union is a trough of money that it is legitimate to seize for one's own purposes. That reminds me of the comments that voluntary organisations make about lottery funds. Whatever project a voluntary organisation has, its representatives always ask for lottery money. Conversations in assisted areas last only a minute or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
two before someone says, "There must be some European money available", as though there is a great pot into which one needs only to dip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report has identified a lack of transparent and adequate audit trails in member states. Such trails are needed to identify the progress of money from receipt by a member state to final spending. More worryingly, the report suggests that there is a lack of enthusiasm among some member states for transparent audit trails. The report is a pretty damning indictment of what is, after all, a public body spending almost £60 billion a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without wishing to suggest that the United Kingdom is whiter than white, I hope that we have above average standards of probity in public finance and spending. We have traditionally prided ourselves on that. I should like the Minister's assurance that we will address the Court of Auditors' criticism of the United Kingdom to ensure that we are placed on the moral high ground, so that we can legitimately address the weaknesses that we perceive elsewhere in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the report pussyfooted around the problem; weasel words were used, and there was no attempt to name and shame the poor performers and the greater offenders. We must put our house in order, but it would greatly help us if we knew the scale of this country's problem compared with those of other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that an analysis of the Court of Auditors' comments would show that the United Kingdom is by no means one of the worst offenders. I hope that we offend the least. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will say something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to distinguish between fraud perpetrated by member states—whether it be fraud in the criminal sense or just a laxity of control which amounts to a fraud on other member states' taxpayers—fraud perpetrated by private individuals and companies and, perhaps most importantly, fraud perpetrated by private individuals and companies which is implicitly condoned by member states' Governments. Perhaps we can most easily close in on the latter category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that during the British presidency the Government will press for transparent audit trails to end beneficiaries, on which the Court of Auditors has focused, and make the existence of such trails a condition of future disbursements. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, threatening to turn off the tap is the only way to ensure compliance, especially in member states in which standards of public finance accountability are rather lower than we in the United Kingdom would expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Economic Secretary will also take on board the suggestion that future Court of Auditors reports should name and shame. Let us know who are the offenders; let us try to put some moral pressure on the worst of them. What about a system of penalties for errors made by member states? The system of self-assessment introduced by the Inland Revenue places the onus on the individual taxpayer to assess his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
liability. If he gets it wrong, he pays the price. Why cannot we propose to our European Union partners that that system be applied in the European Union?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government argue for a reversal of the currently reversed burden of proof? At present, when the Commission believes that member states have disbursed money wrongly, it is for the Commission to prove that, rather than for the member state to prove that the money has been disbursed correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will assure us that during the United Kingdom presidency the Government will be prepared to tread on toes if necessary, to bring the matter to the fore, and to ensure that we can justifiably take the moral high ground without being accused of hypocrisy and humbug.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members have mentioned their reaction on reading the Court of Auditors report. As I am a new Member, this is the first such report that I have read. As I said during a previous sitting, I am used to reading auditors' reports on local councils and local authorities. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If this were an auditor's report on a local authority, I would not be here but elsewhere—being paid by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to repeat what other hon. Members have said, but such reports on the budgetary processes of the European Community undermine the Community in the eyes of ordinary people. If we do not respond to it in a way that commands confidence and allows people to feel that the public money invested in the Community is being used for the purposes for which it is intended, confidence will dissipate. Budgetary processes are often seen as being about people being mean and ensuring that not too much money is spent; they are actually about effective spending of money. The report shows that in some cases we have no idea whether the money being spent on the Community's policy objectives of poverty alleviation, employment creation and regeneration, and on issues concerning youth, leisure and women, which we would all support, is helping to meet those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear the Economic Secretary mention the progress referred to in some of the documents before us. The European Community is moving towards the sort of practice that many of us, when we were local councillors—I am sorry to harp on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
about having been a local councillor—regarded as normal. That means that there is a set budget, with performance indicators that are measured as one goes along, and if one does not meet the terms, one has to go back for extra authorisation. Monitoring takes place all the time. Everything is enforced and properly evaluated afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with Opposition Members that there are some ineffective management structures, but there is obviously considerable fraud, whether by people abusing the system or using the regulations to benefit themselves. Whatever we call it, there is creative use of the system—a system that is often not clear in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to respond positively to the measure. There must be interaction between the Commission and member states in establishing how criticisms in the report are to be met. That will ensure that public money is properly spent, that the policy objectives of the European Community are properly met and that public confidence in the budgetary process is maximised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.26 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My comments will probably be a little at odds with the rather negative tone of much of our debate, but I shall begin with consensus. The remarks attributed to the Minister in the Select Committee report to the effect that mismanagement is neither acceptable nor necessary are a good starting point on good common ground. I also agree with the hon. Members who congratulated the Court of Auditors on its thorough work. As someone who was in a public company until about nine months ago and who has also been a councillor, I have never experienced routine external supervision to such a degree. We flatter ourselves a little to imagine that all our institutions are subject to the same level of scrutiny as the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman has not seen such scrutiny before, I can only assume that he has not been a member of a Labour council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a Labour councillor in a Labour council, and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that it was not subject to anything like that degree of scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the report has been interpreted reinforces the stereotype of the Commission being dominated by bumbling Belgian bureaucrats and corrupt Italian mafiosi. That gives a false perspective on how the system operates. There are two clear conclusions in the report, neither of which has been referred to. It says that the main cause of criticism is lack of effective financial management; it is not fraud. Fraud makes a much better soundbite, of course, and one is much more likely to appear in the media by citing it. But the report is essentially a criticism of financial management practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that is made clearly is the distinction between substantive and formal errors. Substantive errors are serious; they account for 5 per cent. of expenditure, which is too much and should not be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
permitted. Much of the criticism in the report is about formal errors—not dotting "i"s and crossing "t"s in bureaucratic terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many important issues have been confused and subsumed in the criticism of how the Commission operates. It is clear that many of the malpractices referred to are a product not of bad administration but of policy failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give two examples of that, one of which relates to agriculture. The Select Committee report said that there was so much waste and fraud because regulation failed to take account of world prices. The central criticism of the common agricultural policy is that it is a protectionist arrangement that does not consider world prices. British Governments have heard that criticism over the years, but they have not been entirely blameless. There was a period in the early days of the Thatcher revolution when a former Minister in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—I think it was Peter Walker—was notorious for arguing for artificially high prices in the Council of Ministers. We have to put up with that inheritance. Many of the distortions and much of the waste stems from the failure of Ministers, not administrators—those two have been badly confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the criticisms concerning Customs relate to how rules of origin and preferential arrangements operate. Again, that is largely politically driven. I was asked in the late 1970s to design a system of trade preferences for Directorate-General I. Encouraged by the European Commission, I produced a system that was simple, transparent and designed to give maximum access in trade terms. When it got through the Council of Ministers, every Government came along with spanners, such as garlic products that had to be exempted because of special interests, and so on. Then the Foreign Ministers became involved and wanted this or that country exempted. A complex pyramid of preferences grew up, to which human rights and labour standards were added, resulting in a complex set of regulations which inevitably created enormous scope for arbitrage—or fraud, as it is less politely called. That stemmed not from maladministration but from politically driven failure. We must not lose sight of that fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman put into the maladministration category the fact that the report shows that £3 billion ecu was paid in overcompensation in the arable sector? This is the first time that I can recall it being referred to; it was certainly not raised by the Commission in the years 1992–96. Is that maladministration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is maladministration, but I am saying that that stems from a system of support prices, which are determined by Ministers, not by administrators. That system should not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask what are the alternatives to the European arrangements that have been criticised for bad administration? One of the institutions that has been singled out is the TACIS system, involving technical systems and research. I speak with some feeling, because I ran a TACIS programme a few years
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
ago. A team of researchers helped young administrators in Russia with macro-economic policy shortly after the break-up of the former Soviet Union. It was clear that TACIS was a rather cumbersome arrangement and had many of the defects that people often pick out in European Community institutions, but we have to ask how else could it have been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If every national Government had run its own programme supporting the young Russian bureaucrats with their economic policy, we would have had massive duplication. We have a flourishing European network because of the Community initiative. We quickly learnt that there were good people in Stockholm, or in France, so we pooled our knowledge and worked as a team. That ultimately proved to be a productive and constructive relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other alternative would have been to do things on a global basis. We could have gone to the United Nations, but anyone who has ever dealt with the UN development programme will know that by comparison, the European Commission institutions are positively electric in their speed of operation and efficiency. So what are we comparing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final substantive point refers to the fact that the Commission and the administrators have often been criticised for what, in practice, amounts to good governance. An especially telling phrase in the report about sound finance said that the underlying problem was the excessive decentralisation within the European Union, and complained about the way in which the structural funds operate through Länder, provincial governments and local councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decentralisation is the bane of accountants the world over. Accountants sitting in head offices perpetually belly-ache about the fact that the people in Uganda and Cambodia do not produce beautifully manicured accounts. But decentralisation makes for good government, which is why so many European countries are better governed than we are. I welcome the fact that we are moving towards devolution and I should welcome stronger local government. That, in turn, will make accountability more difficult because decentralisation is difficult to monitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach that we are debating seems to be excessively mechanical. It is a centralist point of view, and I do not accept its policy implications. This has been my first opportunity to look at the report and I endorse its broad conclusion about the need for financial prudence. It is obviously essential that we diligently stamp on abuse, but we should not lose sight of the fact that many of the problems are due to failures of policy, not administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too am pleased that there is so much agreement today between hon. Members of all parties. I was particularly impressed by what we have just heard from the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable); he spoke from knowledge greater than mine—although I have some knowledge of the issues. Much of my time in my previous employment was spent travelling to and from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
Brussels and going to EU meetings, so I have some experience of such discussions. There was a distinctly British approach to them, based on sometimes uncomfortable practical realities and facts. Although the British representatives had philosophical differences, we would all tend to say, "If it's broke, fix it; if it's irreparable, change it and let's have another model". However, whenever we said such things, the intake of breath and the sense that Britain was once again being non-communautaire—perish the thought—were palpable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there was a distinct difference in our style of debate and the way in which we spoke about such issues in European circles. There seemed to be a sense that one could do anything but change things. I agree that it is a question not just of administration or fraud, but of a different political approach. That is illustrated by the problems that we have, year after year, with the budget; we examine the details and argue about fraud but never institute fundamental change. I have repeatedly stressed in the Committee that we should look towards radical reforms rather than just considering fraud. I agree that fraud is an important issue; it is particularly important for Britain because—unfairly—we are net contributors. I do not disagree with the suggestion that we are one of the more honest EU nations in terms of fraud. We therefore suffer doubly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member for Wells that Denmark, one of the richest countries in the EU, is one of the biggest net recipients of budget funds, as is Ireland, whose growth rate is now so rapid that it is quickly overtaking Britain's. We, on the other hand, continue to pay considerably more than we should, even with our rebate. The problem is not one of administration but of overall policy. The Government must look seriously at the structure of the budget and at the way in which the EU works as a whole—to quote the cliché, we should look at the big picture rather than the minutiae. I have made that point many times before and I hope that it will be acted on. There is a feeling on both sides of the Committee that something is fundamentally wrong with the budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are doubtless differences between countries with regard to fraud. With respect to international inspection, I take the point of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that we should have serious policing and also perhaps turn off the tap—although if one seriously suggested turning off taps in European circles, one might create a big political crisis. Perhaps we should risk that—or perhaps we should consider changing the arrangements so that fraud cannot occur, particularly with regard to the reformed CAP. The CAP budget effectively redistributes income between the EU nations. If, in framing that budget, one looked at all the beneficiaries and contributors and included a factor for living standards, economic strength and growth, one could create a different pattern of redistribution, in which member states determined how to spend that redistribution. That would surely be an improvement on the present system in which we are net contributors but every borough
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
receives small EU grants for this and that and everyone thinks, "Isn't the EU wonderful; it's always giving us money"—while we pay in far more than we receive. If we paid a fair amount—perhaps we could be one of the neutrals that are neither net contributors nor net recipients—we would have a billion or two more to give in grants to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems is the regressive aspect. I am pleased to see a reference to progressive reform of the common agricultural policy, from consumer pays to taxpayer pays. Consumer pays is regressive because everyone must buy food; it is a fundamental element of the daily budget. Each family spends on average £20 a week on food more than might be paid under other arrangements. At least a taxpayer-pays system would be more progressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted to make many other points, but I have perhaps taken up too much time, so I simply congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on her grasp of this complex matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Broxtowe, who made one of the most thoughtful contributions to the debate, missed the point about net and gross contributions. If we looked at the United Kingdom domestic budget and applied the principle that we should be concerned only with net contributions, our net contribution would be zero; we receive all that we pay and pay all that we receive. Therefore, if we were concerned only with net contributions to the EU, we would be unconcerned with the entire expenditure of the United Kingdom Government—not an attitude which any member of the Committee would share. Therefore, we should concentrate on gross contributions, on the amount of money being raised from taxpayers in Europe and we should always ask, "Is that money being well administered?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate on what has been described, in one case, as the big picture and, in another, as the political drive—that is, the question on which the report focuses above all: budgetary management. Although I have not served on this Committee before, I have, alas, read Court of Auditors reports for other reasons and, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South rightly said, this is the first of its reports to draw attention to budgetary management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South referred to paragraph 0.2 on page 7 of the first volume of the report, in which the Court of Auditors draws attention to the problem of over-generous allocation. In my questions to the Minister and in her answers, we established at least part of the scale of that overgenerous allocation. There is about a 1.5 becu—about £1 billion—a year mismatch just in the structural funds, between the budget and where payments end up. During previous debates, the Committee has identified that as the order of magnitude of the gaps that occur throughout the EU budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
I agree with the point that the Minister made in answer to my second question, in that one must be cautious about the evolution of expenditure over a six-year period. Nevertheless, more worryingly in the longer term, the fact that only a third of the total allocation on structural funds has been spent after three years of a six-year period—a gap of about 50 becu, or £35 billion—suggests significant laxity in the budget. That is entirely the responsibility, at least in theory, of the Council of Ministers. One cannot blame officials or the Commission for the failure of a budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In no sense, am I making a party political point; I regret to say that the previous Government were as responsible as this Government. Indeed, accusations cannot even be made against the British Government; they have to be made against all the Governments of Europe. Collectively in the Council of Ministers, they have failed over many years to establish a budgetary system, as opposed to a targeting system, which is what the Economic Secretary has already admitted we have. There is no point in wittering on about that; the question is: is there a chance of doing something about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman describe the previous Government's record over 18 years as evidence of incompetence? They were unable to tackle the system. We cannot compare the current Government, who have been in power for a matter of months, with the previous Government, who were in power for 18 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that intervention, because up to now the Committee has engaged in a constructive spirit in a matter of national concern. The answer is: no, it is not a matter of competence, it is a matter of whether we can get all members of the EU Councils to agree. Even if the United Kingdom Government consisted of the greatest possible geniuses, the problem is not something that they alone could ever solve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary's task is therefore terrible; she cannot just go to the Council and argue the case; she has to wait. I freely admit that we lost that argument for 18 years; if the hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Twigg) wants to refer to that as gross incompetence, I am perfectly happy to accept that charge on behalf of previous Conservative Administrations. However, I warn him that, alas, it is all too likely that the same accusation of gross incompetence will be levelled against his Administration after five years. We face a systemic difficulty in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, to mention the problem is nothing; the point is to do something about it. The one contribution that the Committee could make towards doing something is to elucidate why the systemic problem exists. That returns us to the observations I made at the start of my speech, and which many hon. Members have made, about net and gross contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that when representatives of many member states some to Councils of Ministers to discuss the budget, they are, oddly enough, not thinking in sufficiently communautaire terms. They do not think about the Community as a whole and ask whether its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
budgetary system works, which is what the Court of Auditors has laudably done. They ask themselves, "Can I get an advantage for my country this year by arguing for this or that to be included, in the hope that I will be able to spend it—well or fraudulently? If not, can I get a transfer of appropriations later, or else make things so confused and complicated that I can find some heading under which to spend the money that I want? All in all, I am a massive net recipient."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So long as that attitude persists among a significant proportion of those attending Councils, I suspect that for all the Economic Secretary's eloquence and vigour—once she returns to full health—she will be wholly unable to counter it. The Committee, Parliament and the Government must ask how we can make the argument sufficiently well to persuade the representatives of other European countries to take a different attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Court of Auditors report is clearly a beginning, but we would go further towards achieving our goal if the Economic Secretary were somehow to ensure that the Commission was asked not merely to respond formally to particular problems and to tackle the minutiae of fraud—as it has done in a pro forma sense—but to provide a full-scale explanation of how it intends to remedy the budgetary process. That is what has been done by Agenda 2000 and the sound and efficient management initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission ought to welcome the suggestion that all representatives on the Council of Ministers should be forced to think about the interests of the Community and its taxpayers, not their narrow national self-interest of getting more money out of the system—a pursuit which then runs riot. That is an essay question that the Commission could usefully be set. Alas, at present, the Commission is part of the conspiracy; it does deals with specific member states to get them to approve elements of its proposed budget on precisely the logic that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a great achievement if the United Kingdom Government were to turn the Commission into an ally of the Court of Auditors, rather a party to the fudged deals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue to crave the indulgence of the Committee by remaining seated; I am grateful to the Committee for allowing that. I note that there is a debate on the Floor of the House today about flu vaccination; that is indeed good timing. Many points have been raised this morning. Our debate has been useful. It has allowed us to express the grave concern of hon. Members about financial management as well as to state our support for the work of the European Court of Auditors. Given that my winding-up speech will have to be made at a fairly brisk canter, I undertake to write to members of the Committee if I do not manage to cover the points that they raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin with the question about tobacco that I was unable to answer earlier. We share the criticisms that the court has made about the current regime and the pressing need for reform, a view that was put most eloquently by the right hon. Member for Wells.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
Ideally, we should like the regime to be phased out or, failing that, reformed fundamentally. That will be an uphill struggle, however, because not all member states share our view. Paying one billion ecu a year for a crop that endangers health is not a sound basis on which to support poor areas that are heavily reliant on tobacco.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair to the Commission, it has said that the present system is not sustainable. The enlargement process will put even greater pressure on it. I think that the Commission is scheduled to introduce its proposals for the reform of the tobacco regime at the Agriculture Council this week and the Government will restate our objective of phasing out gradually all support for tobacco production. We will argue for the most radical reform negotiable in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to the timing of the deposit of the transfer. There is a special procedure for the scrutiny of transfers—mainly because there are so many of them and they have to be processed quickly. In addition, there was a problem associated with the physical handling of the transfer because of difficulties that were experienced in Brussels last autumn. I corresponded with the Chairman of the Scrutiny Committee about it, because it had knock-on effects on the United Kingdom Government. We are alert to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I whole-heartedly take on board what the right hon. Member for Wells and other members of the Committee said about the pile of documentation that is provided for us. It makes a point because one of the reasons why we have difficulties with financial management in the European Union is the multiplicity of documents and rules and the lack of transparency and clarity. I want scrutiny procedures improved. I was much taken by the suggestions made by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Clark) when he spoke in a Budget debate in the summer of last year. He urged that we give attention to how we improve scrutiny. A matter such as the European Court of Auditors report highlights the importance of scrutiny. It allows the United Kingdom Parliament to look in detail at how taxpayers' money is being disbursed by the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South made an extremely perceptive speech about the difficulties that we are encountering. For many years, he has prosecuted his case in a way that others are now following. I recognise his frustration, which has been experienced by other hon. Members, with how the Commission seems to strike deals that appear to be against the best interests of sound financial management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is to change the financial regulatory structure and to achieve clarity and transparency in the organisation of finances. We are about to engage in a process of looking at the next financial perspectives and regulation. It is critical that we learn from what my hon. Friend said. The point that he makes is one to which I repeatedly return. The structure of financial
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
perspectives has caused them to be seen as targets, not ceilings. It is the structure of targeting that has allowed some of the laxness that has been referred to. It is important to learn that lesson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The own-resources ceiling for 1999 is 1.27 per cent. of GNP. We understand that the Commissioners are likely to propose a budget for this year of 1.10 per cent. of GNP, which is a large margin below the financial perspectives. It is our view and the view of several other member states that we must maximise that margin. However, it does not get away from my hon. Friend's comment that the structure itself is flawed. We must now start difficult negotiations on the next financial perspectives; it is key to making sure not only that we approve financial management, but that we make enlargement affordable. I take on board what my hon. Friend said about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also spoke about reform of the common agricultural policy. I do not wholly swallow the line that the CAP reforms of 1992 solved a raft of problems. However, they moved in the right direction. If we get movement in the right direction, we must be ready to build upon it. Of course, we have much more to do. Increased vigour on CAP reform is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also referred to arable crops and beef. The UK first highlighted and quantified the extent of cereals overcompensation. It is important to take into account both the direct payments and the fall in feed costs that resulted from the MacSharry reforms, and compare them with the fall in market revenues. That suggests a degree of overcompensation. However, we must also bear in mind that BSE further complicated matters from 1996–97. It is important that we learn lessons from that exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to win agreement from other members states for reform. We must also win friends and influence people to secure a greater emphasis on effective management. The right hon. Member for Wells pooh-poohs the ECOFIN meeting in May. It is important that, for the first time, ECOFIN will get the No. 1 Finance Ministers to address those questions. They are unglamorous, technical issues, usually left to people at my level; but one of the key elements of the May meeting is ensuring that senior Finance Ministers engage in the process, and recognise its significance for spending taxpayers' money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Wells raised several points about budget discipline that have been raised before. With his agreement, I shall write to him more fully on that to allow me to answer some of the other questions raised today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to financial penalties and the question of naming and shaming. I smile at the expression; it has been much associated with me recently and I may get a reputation for it. It is possible to identify from the European Court of Auditors report those member states that have not acted in a way that we would find acceptable. We believe that there is an adequate legal base to allow penalties, but other member states disagree. With the new financial regulation negotiations, we have an opportunity to seek a means to build that in, and seek proper redress. Indeed, Spain

is currently taking the Commission to the European Court of Justice on the question of financial corrections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Wells asked about expenditure on Ireland. I am sure that he is not suggesting that, because there is money in the pot, it must be spent regardless of the quality of programmes. It is important to ensure that quality programmes match up with quality procedures. Irregularities are built into the repayment procedures if a programme is delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
This has been a useful and worthwhile debate. We shall undoubtedly return to the subject. Valuable lessons can be learned from the European Court of Auditors report. It is in everyone's interest to ensure that those lessons are put into practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
