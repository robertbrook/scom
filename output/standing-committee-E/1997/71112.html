Landfill of Waste</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The current proposals from the Commission follow the failure of an earlier attempt to legislate on landfill at a European level. My Department has two main concerns in relation to the proposals. First, better regulation of waste disposal is required to ensure high environmental standards—I am sure the Committee supports that—and, secondly, improved, coherent waste management is necessary—I am sure the Committee also supports that.<br><br>
Historically, the suitability of our geology in the United Kingdom has meant that we have made great use of landfill as a means of waste disposal. We have considerable experience—more than most of our European partners—in soundly managed landfill. It is critical, however, to ensure that our regulatory regime provides the environment and the public with a high degree of protection and that policy at European and national levels encourages more sustainable waste management practices with an emphasis on the minimisation of waste and recycling.<br><br>
We strongly support high environmental standards in the landfilling of waste and we have made that clear. We therefore endorse unequivocally those parts of the directive concerned with the establishment of strict regulatory standards. Specifically, that includes the articles dealing with permit arrangements, the covering of all costs, including environmental costs, involved in the setting up, operation, closure and aftercare of landfills, and procedures for the control and monitoring, closure and reporting on of sites. Those form the backbone of existing waste legislation in the United Kingdom. Ensuring that similar rules apply in other member states would help to provide better protection for the environment and a more accurate reflection of the full environmental cost of waste. We welcome both.<br><br>
The Government are also keen to promote recycling and recovery initiatives. However, we are particularly concerned about the limits on the landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste in article 5 and acceptance criteria for waste in landfill, especially the prohibition of co-disposal and the requirement in article 6 to pre-treat all waste going to landfill. We are concerned that the directive should not reduce our ability to adopt an environmentally sensitive and sensible approach to waste management in each case based on current technology and risk assessment.<br><br>
In the United Kingdom we currently landfill about 85 per cent. of municipal waste. We are concerned that the current proposals set deadlines that are too tight to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
be able to encourage sufficient significant increases in recycling. We would have to build a number of incinerators to meet limits. The capital costs for that have been estimated at between £3 billion and £7 billion. The lower end of that range assumes that recycling increases substantially from the low base bequeathed to us by our predecessors.<br><br>
We are not convinced that incineration before landfilling is necessarily more sustainable than straightforward landfill in well-managed sites with good quality methane capture. There are certainly situations in which incineration with energy recovery makes sound environmental sense, but it must be carried out to the strictest environmental standards and must take place as part of an integrated strategy that encourages the minimisation and recycling of waste. Frankly, the dash to incineration required by the directive would not allow for that, which is a problem. Our preferred approach would be to remove that part of the directive. It would be more sensible to focus on the environmental harm that the directive aims to avoid—that is, methane emission—in line with current regulatory practice in the United Kingdom. It seems likely, however, that almost all other member states will accept the targets in principle. We may, therefore, need to consider a compromise solution to impose targets that can more sensibly be met.<br><br>
Much in the directive makes sound environmental sense, and we shall encourage our partners to accept high environmental standards. We are less satisfied with the justification for some of the articles. We shall have to work hard to explain the UK point of view and reach an agreement that commands broad support. The directive would fill a long-standing gap in European waste legislation. I am confident that, preferably including the changes that we favour, the directive can make a positive contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. May I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time? Hon. Members may ask more than one question and there will be ample opportunity for questions to be answered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree with the following statement in the explanatory memorandum:
<br><blockquote><p>"Member States should adopt a homogenous policy related to landfills and that standards should be harmonised throughout the Community"?</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We certainly want to see high environmental standards throughout the Community. One especially tragic example of the consequences of low standards was at La Coruna in Spain, where there was a landfill slide with devasting consequences. We have high environmental standards in Britain and it is in the interests of all inhabitants of the EC that those high standards should be disseminated throughout the Community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister accepts, as I believe he does, that it is legitimate or moral on environmental grounds to put waste into properly contained and managed holes in the ground, provided there is proper
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0111">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
methane capture, why is he opposed to co-disposal? Surely there is no practical difference as long as the right wastes are put in the appropriate holes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point, with which I have some sympathy. For those members of the Committee who are not familiar with the term, let me explain that co-disposal refers to the monitored treatment of certain industrial and commercial wastes, both liquid and solid, by interaction with biodegradable waste in a controlled landfill site. We believe that co-disposal makes sense. It uses degradation processes to render potentially hazardous waste harmless and, especially in light of the UK flushing bioreactor philosophy, that is a sensible way of dealing with hazardous waste. However, hardly any other member state holds that opinion, and we must take account of their views. Under article 5, biodegradable wastes must be reduced to no more than 75 per cent. by 2002, no more than 50 per cent. by 2005 and no more than 25 per cent. by 2010.<br><br>
We have done our best to persuade other member states otherwise. At the Environmental Ministers' Council on 16–17 October, I set out our beliefs on why co-disposal made a lot of sense. Despite the forcefulness of my logic, those beliefs did not carry at the Council. We must take account of the fact that we may not succeed.<br><br>
There is nothing wrong in our philosophy, but we must get the agreement of at least enough other member states if our view is to prevail. The matter remains under negotiation. There is still no common position, and probably there will be none under the Luxembourg presidency because the European Parliament has not yet given its opinion. I shall continue to propagate our view, but the right hon. Gentleman should understand the limits within which I can do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that we have high standards in the United Kingdom. He must, therefore, be satisfied that domestic legislation is coping with all the problems that we might have. Does he feel that there is any specific area in which domestic legislation is not succeeding or is inadequate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have high standards in the UK but that does not mean that all 499 sites taking biodegradable waste meet the highest standards that we want to propagate. In particular, 160 sites currently capture methane gas—52 to produce energy and just over 100 to flare the gas. We believe that that number can be increased substantially by 2010. However, some of our poorer landfill sites still fail in methane capture, and there is still leaking of pollutant leachate. One good aspect of the directive is that it will ensure that lower standards at a minority or our landfill sites must be improved. That is entirely in accord with our intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following on from the question put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean), what will the Minister do if he cannot persuade his colleagues to see his point of view?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have considered that, of course. We must consider an extension of the time scales that I have outlined so that we can achieve an alternative to landfill, as the Commission proposes. Our concern is that we are being required to do that too prescriptively and within such tight time scales as to make it impossible to achieve the improvement that we want in recycling. Improvement in waste recycling has begun from what I have to say was an exceedingly low base under the previous Administration of about 2 per cent. in 1992. It is now up to about 6.5 per cent. to 7 per cent. and is continuing to improve. However, if 85 per cent. is landfilled and we have only the five years until 2002—or even the 13 years until 2010 when biodegradable waste must not be more than 25 per cent.—the goal of getting our recycling totals anywhere near the level required to avoid a huge increase in incineration cannot be achieved. If we cannot get the Commission and the Council to take account of what we really want—the removal of those targets from article 5—and to consider the real objective of the policy, which is to increase minimisation of recycling of waste, and if the Commission and Council still insist on prescriptive targets, we must at least try to extend the targets. We are in negotiation on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Swinney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the increase in recycling that has occurred in recent years, modest though it has been. What measures are the Government taking to expand that more considerably to meet some of the draft directive's suggestions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important matter about which I am very concerned. It is not easy to achieve that expansion because the basic requirement is that there have to be markets for recycled products. If no one buys such products a large increase will be difficult to realise. We are examining the achievements of the more successful local authorities. I mentioned an average figure of about 6 or 7 per cent., but I believe that eight local authorities have achieved the Government's target of 25 per cent. Most of those authorities are in the south and contain better-off families, who may have greater opportunities to engage in the recycling effort that is needed locally. That effort should be further extended nationally—doing so is a key requirement.<br><br>
The only other major possibility is separation at source of household waste, but that raises wider questions of cost. We are carefully considering that strategy, and we shall soon publish our proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I offer my commiserations to the Minister, who is obviously able to affect the argument about this matter only at the margins. He highlighted the two core issues that affect this country, the first of which is cost. The upper limit is £7 billion, which is one third of our total defence estimate and the full equipment cost for defence. Where will those costs fall? Will they be met by local government, the taxpayer or the people who carry out waste disposal? The second issue is compliance. What are the Minister's views on that matter? Many people feel that while there are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0112">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
difficulties in the United Kingdom there are glaring examples in the European Union where our compliance is entirely ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about the hon. Gentleman's latter point, but he asked a fair question. I am concerned about the sizeable costs that are involved. I should make it clear that a one-year cost is not involved—the strategy will run over 10 years. We estimate the total cost to be probably between £250 million and £750 million. Additional costs are associated with burning wastes from landfills, banning the co-disposal of hazardous and of non-hazardous waste, banning the landfill of tyres and banning hospital waste, all of which are mentioned in the directive.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked where the compliance costs will fall. Those substantial additional costs are likely to fall on local authorities because the biodegradable waste targets refer to municipal waste. That is precisely why we are pressing as strongly as we can in our negotiations with our partners either to get those targets removed from article 5 or to get the time scale substantially increased. Otherwise, the targets are not acceptable. Money will have to be spent on the provision of incinerators. We should take account of the improved standards achieved by the EU directive that came into operation on 1 December 1996. The emission controls that apply to incinerators have substantially improved. However, the public do not want a huge expansion of incineration in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pursue a scientific argument with the Minister. Does he agree that, in the main, incineration releases more CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> gases than landfill sites? We know that landfill results in the release of methane, and that it is not possible immediately to cap a landfill site. Capping is not possible until the site is filled, and there will be some loss into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, some greenhouse gases will be locked in.<br><br>
The Minister believes that incineration releases everything, but even with scrubbers in the plant there will still be more greenhouse gases released following incineration. Is he advancing that view in Brussels? Is he presenting scientific papers from the excellent scientists in his Department who can back him up? Might his view prevail in Brussels, or give us allies in other countries?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter is complicated. Some emissions from incinerators are indeed damaging, the most serious of which is dioxin, a carcinogenic compound. However, the new standards that became operative on 1 December 1996 have reduced that to 1 nanogram per cubic metre, which is an exceedingly small proportion.<br><br>
Incinerators are therefore safer, but there are still emissions from them. It is, however, equally true that there are emissions, especially methane, from landfill. I understand that 43 per cent. of United Kingdom methane emissions come from landfill—a high proportion. As a greenhouse gas, it is second only to CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub -->.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Methane capture deals with the problem—it is not always 100 per cent. effective, but it is largely effective. Methane capture takes place on about one third of all our sites. We believe that we can increase that proportion to 80 or 90 per cent. by 2010.<br><br>
It is a complicated issue; the argument does not go in either direction. We have, however, made the evidence to support both sides of the argument widely available in our official discussions in Brussels, and I have alluded to them in the Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The explanatory memorandum states:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Provision allows Member States to take account of local conditions."</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister point to a single sentence in any article of the draft directive that justifies that claim?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that particular local conditions may be taken into account is something for which we have argued, as have other member states. The best example is in respect of small states, or where there are small islands—for example, the highlands and islands, and Greece, where particular arguments apply. Derogations have been sought on that basis, which are perfectly reasonable.<br><br>
I agree with the thrust of what I think the hon. Gentleman is saying: it is true that the directive is very prescriptive; it should be much looser. Even if it is not a matter of subsidiarity for the reasons that I have given, it should take more account of local conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by declaring an interest: until entering the House on 1 May, I was a full-time tanner. I retain an active interest in my family leather business and am currently president of the European Tanners Confederation.<br><br>
Article 5 bans liquid waste but allows sludges: why? What is the Minister's definition of a "liquid waste" and "sludge"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not a technical expert; given the hon. Gentleman's experience and background, I probably cannot give him the precise answer that he wants. It seems obvious what a liquid waste is: it is not an inert waste; it is not an inorganic waste; it is one that can flow within the landfill. We do not believe that that is necessarily a bad thing. If a landfill is kept wet, it is in a highly polluting condition that can assist, through the degradation process, the gradual destruction of some of the more hazardous elements in the landfill.<br><br>
I am not sure of the direction of the hon. Gentleman's question about sludges—I think that we all know roughly what a sludge is. If the hon. Gentleman explains further what he means, I will attempt to answer him more fully, although I am not an expert in these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 16 of the explanatory memorandum states that
<br><blockquote><p>"some of its proposals do not show sufficient regard for subsidiarity".</p></blockquote>
The answer that the Minister gave to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) leads me to think that subsidiarity does not apply at all, except in the small example that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Minister gave to my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo). What is the Minister going to do about this?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already explained what I am seeking to do about it. We believe that higher landfill standards are to be welcomed in all countries, including the UK, although I believe that higher standards would have a much more pervasive and drastic effect in several other member states that I would prefer not to mention.<br><br>
I accept, nevertheless, that the measures are too prescriptive. Subsidiarity does not effectively apply as long as the standards and the target dates are written in their present form. We want to see a higher degree of subsidiarity, within the broad principle of raising landfill standards across Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has not gone unnoticed that the Minister, who parades himself and the Government as concerned with environmental matters, is now arguing for a deferral of effective dates for which environmentalists would no doubt dearly wish. In that context, the Minister also asks us to trust that he will be able to persuade his colleagues to defer the dates that they say in this document that they would like. If the Minister cannot persuade his European partners and friends on this point, where will he find the £3 billion. to £7 billion to pay for the incinerators?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our preferred option is to remove the target from the directive completely, and to have a two-stage directive that sets the tighter landfill standards that we all support and lays down a strategy for maximising the recycling and minimisation of waste. I have already explained that if we cannot achieve that preferred option, we will aim to extend the target dates as far into the future as possible, thereby spreading the costs over a substantially longer period and significantly reducing annual costs. I make no bones about the fact that there are significant costs written into the directive, for the UK and, I think, all other member states. The majority of the compliance costs, as I have already said, will be borne by local authorities, which greatly worries us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether it is appropriate to let the Committee know that I am a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Most of my professional activity was in bridge reconstruction, however, and I have no real expertise in landfills. I am interested in article 8(1)(b), which states that
<br><blockquote><p>"the management of the landfill site will be in the hands of a technically competent person".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister outline what qualifications are appropriate to manage a landfill site in this country, and in other member states?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell my hon. Friend exactly what qualifications are required. In the vast majority of UK cases, however, those who manage landfill sites are properly qualified. The necessary qualifications are laid down by UK legislation, which is enforced. This part of the directive will bear heavily on many member states, where it is clear that the people responsible for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
a large number of sites are not properly qualified, which has led to accidents. The attempts of other member states to pursue our preference for co-disposal have not been carried out in a controlled way by qualified professionals, and there have been mistakes and some small disasters. That is precisely what this aspect of the directive is designed to avoid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue the matter of incinerators. I do not know what the Minister's experience is, but I have rarely found my constituents to give much of a welcome to the idea of incinerators in their neighbourhood. If the thrust of the document revolves around what the Minister, with charming and disarming honesty, referred to as a dash to incineration, what feel does the Minister have for the response of his constituents and others to that? How many sites for incinerators will he be offering his constituency? Does he propose to persuade his colleagues to alter the planning laws that we put in place in order to ease the building of incinerators and to ensure that they will not be obstructed by unreasonable local objections?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have no intention of changing the planning laws to incorporate the building of incinerators, which has to conform to planning requirements. There will be public inquiries in many cases. It is precisely because there is understandable resistance, that to be pushed into building 50 or more incinerators—a substantial increase—when currently there are only about a dozen, is not welcome in general. Although incinerators are not particularly sightly, they are a great deal safer than they were. The improvements made to emissions about a year ago as a result of a European Union directive has dramatically improved local emissions, and therefore the safety, of incinerators compared with the 1960s and 1970s. I fear that that is not well recognised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are there any in Oldham?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are no incinerators in Oldham although there are plans involving greater Manchester, and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will be delighted to know that my constituents will not be far away. I would, however, be the first to agree that they are probably not delighted about that fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I return to the business of cost? The Minister said that the bulk of the cost will fall on local authorities which, as a result of Government action, will be faced with a double whammy at the turn of the century. My county council will have to find £5 million a year as a consequence of the Budget on its pension fund. In addition, it will now have to absorb the compliance cost which I assume will be passed on in a form of council tax. What is the Department's estimate of the effect of that on the level of council tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is running a long way down the track before its direction has been established. I remind him and the Committee that several steps must be taken before we reach that point. First, the debate continues in the Environment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Council on the form of the directive—whether article 5 targets should be removed. It is difficult to see how that would be achieved, but no decision was taken at the October Council. There will almost certainly be further discussion at the December Council in Brussels. The position may be foreclosed then, but it has not been so far.<br><br>
Secondly, our demands and those of a number of other states—I think four or five also find the targets too prescriptive—must be considered. There is a good chance that there will be a considerable extension of the time targets. However, I cannot tell the Committee—because I do not know—what the new targets will be. The matter is under negotiation. If we manage to achieve a significant extension of the time targets, the cost per year for local authorities will be reduced. However, there is the further question of how those extra charges will be met. The hon. Gentleman would not be right simply to assume that that would mean an increase in council tax. It is a long way down the track before we reach that point. We are talking about the next 15 or 20 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is my first time as a member of a European Standing Committee. The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) asked an interesting question, but some Opposition Members seem to be moving towards Euroscepticism. I say that in the context of subsidiarity. In other legislation, subsidiarity is not spelt out. It is allowed if it is pressed for, but why should it be spelt out here?<br><br>
It is extraordinary that some Opposition Members are suddenly in the forefront on environmentalism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must ask a question. He will have the opportunity to speak later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made a long introduction for which I apologise.<br><br>
When my right hon. Friend the Minister took over his brief in May, did he find any holes in it that he is now desperately trying to fill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We inherited the directive from the previous Administration. In fairness to them, I must say that it was badly drafted by the Commission. It was thrown out by the European Parliament—not least because the way in which it was drafted meant that a high proportion of the EU territorial area was excluded from its requirements. I am sure that that was a mistake, but the directive has now been rectified. For the first time, the targets have been included in the second draft of the directive. They were not in the first draft and, to that extent, this is a new matter and it is not one on which the previous Administration had much of an opportunity to take a position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Best</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is also my first time as a member of a European Standing Committee. Does my right hon. Friend agree that Opposition Members have more enthusiasm for questioning the costs to our economy than understanding the costs involved of our not doing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
what has been suggested, such as taking action on the long-term damage to our environment? Does he agree that we should be attending to a marked area for improvement and that failure to do so will have a catastrophic effect on the rest of the Community? Pollution and the problems associated with it do not stay within national boundaries; they have an international effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. Even without the directive, we would be required under the climate-change agenda, following the Kyoto conference, to meet tight targets in respect of not only CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub -->, but methane. If I recall correctly, CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> represents internationally about 63 per cent. of greenhouse gas emissions; methane represents about 24 per cent. and nitrous oxide represents about 10 per cent. The other three pollutants are hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexaflouride, and they contribute about 2 or 3 per cent. to such emmissions, but are much more potent.<br><br>
We shall have to take action to reduce methane emissions. The current trend in the United Kingdom is down, but if we are to meet our overall basket of gases—the European requirement—we shall have to reduce all three emissions, nor only CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub -->. We will have to reduce methane emissions anyway and 43 per cent. of our methane emissions come from landfill.<br><br>
As for the other aspect to which my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North West (Mr. Best) referred, the other problem with landfill is leachate. It is a highly toxic pollutant which can leak out of badly managed landfill sites and enter the groundwater supplies on which we depend. It is perfectly fair to say that the costs of improving the management and engineering of some poorly constructed landfill sites have substantial implicit savings through the avoidance of potential—and in some cases actual—pollution of groundwater sources. We are alarmed at the costs, but many of them go towards helping not only the environment but public health and we would probably have to meet them in large measure anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps Labour Members were not listening to what we said. We were bolstering the Minister's position. We agree entirely that the costs are excessive, but only if they are spent on the wrong approach to environmental protection, such as incineration—properly controlled landfill could equally well protect the environment.<br><br>
I press the Minister again. What is he doing to persuade Europe to his point of view? The policy that he advocates—landfill with effective methane capture—is admirable and the science backs it. It will result in fewer CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions to the atmosphere.<br><br>
The new Government say, "Trust us. We have a new relationship with Europe. Europe will now listen to us because we are talking to them nicely." The Minister has talked to the Europeans nicely—buddy-buddy—but it has not worked. He is still isolated. Will he, therefore, use all scientific means to persuade them? It is no good to say that he referred to methane capture at the informal meeting or the summit. The Government must produce scientific reports to capture as many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
allies as we can. That method may be more successful than the buddy-buddy method, which has not worked. It is cheaper if the buddy-buddy approach works, but the Minister may have to do more work on the science.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is right to say that the previous Government favoured disengagement. They refused to argue or engage in discussion and they resisted any approach from Europe, however reasonable. That did not work either. It isolated us and provoked irritation and hostility from Europe, which everyone recognises has been very unhelpful.<br><br>
We now have a new relationship with Europe, which has yielded benefits. That does not mean that Europe will agree to everything we say, even if we are sure that we are right—we must argue our case.<br><br>
What the right hon. Gentleman referred to as the buddy-buddy discussion is not over. On 17 October, we had a first round-table orienteering debate at the Environment Council. There will be another such meeting in December, at which we will attempt to draw the threads together.<br><br>
Of course we are putting the scientific case. We have pressed the advantages of our bioreactor philosophy. It is backed by industry and the Environmental Services Association, with which I have had discussions. We are all persuaded that there are real advantages in degrading waste through that process. All that we can do is to press that case extremely strongly.<br><br>
Unfortunately, there is an idée fixe among certain European states, especially at the political level. The "dirty man of Europe" label, which was attached to us because of the previous Administration's attitudes, still sticks. European Governments take the view—it is an unfortunate prejudgment of what we are saying—that we are sticking to old-fashioned, traditional methods, which do not appeal to their philosophy. We believe that they are wrong. It is less easy to persuade them because of the general attitude to the environmental policy that we inherited.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was critical of Ministers in the former Administration in regard to their relationship with Europe. Those of us who served on this Committee in previous Parliaments have seen Ministers in the same invidious position in which the Minister finds himself—trying to defend the indefensible and to justify things that they themselves may not believe.<br><br>
Given the new pro-Europe attitude of the Government, is the Minister seriously telling the Committee that, despite all the treaties and constitution of the European Union, his mere change of attitude will enable him to deliver things that his predecessors could not deliver?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is my belief that, as a result of a more co-operative attitude of partnership on the part of the new British Government, we have reached agreements on a number of issues, including environmental policy, that we would not otherwise have achieved.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
If we manage to achieve a significant extension of the time target that British industry and local authorities can incorporate, that will be a substantial gain. That will not be everything that we would liked to achieve, but it will be a substantial gain. I do not believe that we will be forced into the prescriptive targets set out in the directive. Although I cannot prove it, I believe we are more likely to achieve some concessions because of the general attitude of the new Government.<br><br>
The EU acidification strategy is another major issue. Because we have been a major source of acid rain over the years—although that has now been much reduced—very tight standards are now being imposed that will impinge substantially upon the UK. Again, we have made the case, which is not special pleading, that we have special considerations; that we want to change, but that we need a realistic timetable in which to do so. That case had been listened to, so there are benefits to our new approach.<br><br>
It is not a case of our being buddy-buddy or expecting co-operation because we speak in nice tones, but if we are seen to be responding realistically to the EU's objectives—EU environmental policy has brought about profound improvements in this country during the past 15 to 18 years that would otherwise never have occurred—people will listen to our case that we have special circumstances and should have greater leeway. That view is justified by our experience over the past six months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I much regret that after a promising start the Minister has lapsed into the pattern of so many of his colleagues of refusing to answer questions and instead ranting about what he alleges happened under the previous Government.<br><br>
I return the Minister to the question of cost. Will he confirm that the cost of implementing the directive will be substantially higher in Britain than in several other EU member states? What assessment have the Government made of that extra relative burden that he proposes to place on this country? On the point raised by the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Mr. Best), is it not clearly the case that if businesses, individuals and local authorities were going to spend £7 billion during the next few years on environmental improvements and we were starting with a blank piece of paper to consider how that money should be spent, this proposal would not even be one of the top 20 suggestions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We ought to view the matter in a little more perspective. First, we are not talking about £7 billion; as I carefully spelt out, we are talking about a range between £250 million and £700 million a year. That is assuming that the targets in the directive are implemented. Of course, if they were not implemented and if there were a longer time scale, the upper and lower limits of the range would be significantly reduced.<br><br>
Opposition Members continue to refer only to the figure at the upper end of the range. Perhaps it would be fairer to refer to an average figure, which would be substantially less. However, I am not denying that a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0116">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
considerable cost is involved, but improvements to landfill management in this country are needed. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West made a valid point in that we will have to do much of this work anyway. For example, we must protect our groundwater supplies at a time of increasing long-term drought and reduce methane emissions under the climate change agenda.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the figures are higher for the United Kingdom than for other countries. I do not know whether that is true in absolute terms, but it certainly is true relative to gross domestic product. Although I do not have the figures with me, I think that several southern Mediterranean states will have to spend a higher percentage of GDP than we will have to spend to meet the requirements of the directive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Clark</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have attended a sitting of the Committee, and I have no expertise in this matter. Maintaining anything does not come cheap and, clearly, if we do not take the necessary steps, there will be long-term effects on the environment. I represent one of the Medway towns where, as my right hon. Friend will know, a planning application for an incinerator is a major issue. Other hon. Members have mentioned the public opinion of such applications. What assessment has been made of the effect of using incinerators or similar disposal methods on meeting our national air quality targets and those in the directive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have been accused of not paying proper regard to the previous Administration, let me give them some credit: my predecessor introduced a national air quality strategy. I have some criticisms of its time scale and of the fact that only four of the eight pollutants were to be put on a statutory basis. However, by and large, it was a good measure, which we are seeking to strengthen. That strategy will be implemented by 2005 at the latest. I hope that I can succeed in having it implemented slightly earlier than that.<br><br>
Eight major pollutants affect air quality. Apart from ozone—a transboundary polluter which cannot be subject to local control—all eight pollutants will be subject to statutory limits, which the expert panels on air quality and ultimately the World Health Organisation have produced. Those air quality standards will be statutory. Therefore, local incinerators will have to meet the requirements of the air quality strategy.<br><br>
The level and toxicity of emissions from incinerators can be exaggerated—certainly, they have been substantially reduced, but they are still a problem. However, incinerators will have to meet air quality targets.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is especially concerned with the situation in Medway. I believe that no application has been received so far for the Halling incinerator and that Kent county council has not taken a decision on the Kingsnorth proposal. Of course, when the council
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
does so, we shall consider the request in the normal way. If there is a request to call in the application, we shall also consider that in the normal way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the Minister's hon. Friends' enthusiasm for environmental matters, does not he feel that he and the Government have an obligation not only to attempt to provide a range of costs—the Minister has gone some way towards that in starting at a low bid of £250 million, which he seems to think is peanuts, and the figure of £7 billion which he gave, which is why we keep talking about it—but to explain how he expects the bill, whether of £250 million or of £7 billion, to be met? How will it be shared between us, as consumers or taxpayers? I hope that the Minister will agree that no one else will be responsible for paying it; it will not be the state or local government, but is in one way or another. How much are we going to be asked to pay for the joys of environmental improvement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I can at least agree with the right hon. Gentleman's words about the joys of environmental improvement, even if that appreciative flavour did not inform the rest of his remarks, which seemed far more concerned with costs than benefits. Whilst costs are important, I have made no attempt to conceal them or the seriousness of the problem we face. However, the measure has significant benefits. The right hon. Gentleman rolls his eyes, but the directive is not a burden that is being imposed on us. It is being implemented for very good reasons. Improved standards in the handling of waste are necessary, in regard not only to landfill but to pushing countries, including the United Kingdom, up the waste hierarchy towards incineration or, as we would much prefer, to recycling and waste minimisation.<br><br>
I cannot add anything to my exhaustive explanation of the costs, apart from those in regard to the article 5 requirement. The recurring additional annual costs for local authorities are between £100 million and £530 million and those figures are within the existing targets. However, I fairly said that if one takes account of the other aspects of the directive the additional costs of banning liquid wastes from landfill, banning the co-disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, banning the landfill of tyres and of hospital waste—the costs rise to between £250 million and £700 million a year. As I said, £700 million is the highest estimate in the range and the figures are based on the existing time scale, so that if that is significantly extended, the costs will come down substantially.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman is right that those costs will have to be borne by the taxpayer in one form or another. We want people to understand that there is a proper benefit in the measure; I repeat that much of it would in any case have to take place, whether under the climate change agenda and the need to reduce methane or under the drought strategy to protect our ground water supplies. Instead of parroting a high figure, the right hon. Gentleman should take account of the content of the directive, of the fact that any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0117">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
responsible UK Government would be required to implement much of it and that there are significant, important benefits attaching to the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A short question, Dr. Vis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to comment on the right hon. Gentleman's question. He said that the range was between £250 million and £7 billion; I thank him for his question because it allows me to ask the Minister to confirm that that is a misrepresentation. It gives on the one hand, the lower end of a yearly expenditure and, on the other, the higher end of the expenditure over 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If previous questioners used the figures of £250 million to £7 billion, my hon. Friend is correct. The figure of £7 billion is the highest estimate of the 10-year cost. The correct figure is between £250 million and £700 million a year over such a period, but the longer that period, the more those figures come down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That brings us to the end of the time alloted for questions. I now call the Minister to move the motion.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 6692/97, relating to the landfill of waste; and welcomes the intention to set high regulatory standards for landfill sites.</p></blockquote>
The discussion so far has made clear to most members of the Committee how important high standards for landfill are for protecting both the environment and public health. The directive needs to be viewed in that light. We are currently in discussion with our European partners, as I have indicated at length. The Committee will appreciate that I cannot go into detail about what changes may be made to the Commission draft, not least because it has not been finally agreed. However, I shall set out our guiding principles.<br><br>
The United Kingdom has a good regulatory system, policed by the Environment Agency. The Government will work with the agency to maintain and improve that system in the light of the requirements of the directive. I repeat what I have exhaustively said already: most of the regulatory provisions make sound sense and we intend to support them vigorously in our continuing discussion in the Council.<br><br>
Improving regulation across Europe will provide wider environmental benefits. It will ensure that the full costs of disposal are taken into account by waste producers—an important principle. It will also cut emissions, particularly of methane, and help prevent environmental disasters such as the Spanish landfill slide that I mentioned earlier.<br><br>
The United Kingdom will seek to ensure that other aspects of the directive where we question the Commission's logic are sensibly amended. I have made
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
clear that we shall do everything we possibly can—we have done a great deal already—to secure that objective. Article 5 would force us to adopt a policy based almost entirely on incineration. I have made it clear to the Council that we do not accept that policy and I had an exchange with the commissioner on the matter. We need to argue for changes to ensure that its impact is more beneficial and that it is based on sound environmental arguments.<br><br>
It is important to recognise that the United Kingdom cannot dictate policy in matters covered by majority voting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman may say, "Ah", but as a member of the previous Government he must surely remember that environmental policy is subject to by qualified majority voting. We have to persuade colleagues in Council, something that the right hon. Gentleman was not gifted at or not inclined to do, to avoid being bypassed, which used to happen all too often. With those qualifications and significant caveats, I commend the motion.</span></p>
<p>11.33 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Norfolk)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a new member of the Committee, I find today's debate a revealing experience, not least because the Minister, who answered our questions with great politeness, nevertheless gave us the impression that he wants to accentuate the few good elements of the directive as much as he can. However, members of the Committee, representing all parties, are still genuinely concerned about various matters.<br><br>
In future debates, the Minister should consider the origins of directives, a subject that has not been mentioned today. I do not suggest that the Minister is entering into a conspiracy, but this directive seems to benefit France in particular, a country that has gone further than others towards incineration. I am interested to know from where in the Commission the directive originated, because countries in the European Union play the national card very hard. Labour Members have made much of the fact that the Opposition have pushed issues such as cost and compliance, but those are key elements in improving the environment. If we are to persuade our voters that we can move forward in this area, they must believe that the costs involved are realistic and based on the best scientific information, rather than being a compromise produced by one or two countries, and that there will be genuine compliance throughout the European Union. To be fair to the Minister, he has flagged the fact that he has major concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves that point, he might want to elaborate on it. He has touched on the important matter of compliance, which the Minister had little opportunity to discuss. Is my hon. Friend aware that the latest figures show that, yet again, the United Kingdom is at the top of the league of compliance with European Union directives? Does it not cause my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0118">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
Friend considerable concern that if we, as good Europeans, comply as always with whatever emerges from the chatty process in which the Minister is engaged, we may find ourselves disproportionately burdened with the costs of adhering to the strict requirements of the directive while watching some of our partner states in the European Union largely ignoring them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simpson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend reinforces the point that if we are to have public opinion on our side in this country, people will want to see compliance, and that will affect British industry and business.<br><br>
My second point, which I raised with the Minister, concerns the impact on local communities and local government. We have discussed a range of figures and we have flagged the considerable costs that will ultimately be imposed on local taxpayers. If we are to persuade people that the money is worth spending, they will have to be persuaded that the environmental aspects of shifting from landfill sites to incinerators is technically the best and most environmentally friendly. My impression is that the Minister is not convinced that that is so and that puts a major question mark in many people's minds.<br><br>
I am left with grave doubts. It is not that the matter is not environmentally important, but that, as the Minister knows, we have major problems in persuading people at local level to have landfill sites, let alone incinerators. If we are to convince people that that is the proper method, they must believe that it is the most cost-effective method and is based on proper science. My impression is that the jury is still out. I shall take the Minister's word that he will put up a good fight on behalf of Britain as well as Europe, but I fear that he will be marginalised. His comment about talking with his colleagues is fine, but the figures are against us and we in Britain may end up with something that is not environmentally the best answer and will impose extra costs on all of us.</span></p>
<p>11.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may surprise the Committee by saying that the European Union has an important role to play in environmental matters, but the Minister will appreciate from my earlier questions that I am concerned about how subsidiarity works—or perhaps does not work, in my submission. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) said, it is important to have compliance across the board in Europe. Paragraph 20 of the explanatory memorandum states that the proposal is
<br><blockquote><p>"unlikely to affect the competitiveness of UK firsm vis-a-vis other European ones."</p></blockquote>
I accept that, but the Government and the whole House need to be aware of the effect of adding cost burdens to industry in this country and in Europe in the context of the greater competition from other parts of the world. We all recognise that in may of those countries to which I am referring the standards for the environment are extremely low—practically non-existent in some cases.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
Therefore, we must be certain of our ground. We must hold the line as far as possible to ensure that costs are kept down and that there is genuine compliance across Europe. I want to see much more subsidiarity. The Minister left the Committee in no doubt that he is perfectly satisfied with how we do things in this country, but we rely heavily on landfill.<br><br>
I understand why the Minister wants to hold on to that particular line. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) pointed out, there are enormous objections to establishing incineration on more sites than we have at present. I am conscious of problems on the borders of Shropshire, for example. A proposal by a firm in my constituency—F.M. Caine and Sons—to erect an incinerator at Knighton in Powys has just been turned down. I am aware, too, of another company—Cluttons—which has two incinerators in Wrexham and a third that is already built and ready to work. It is being denied permission to use that third incinerator by the local authority. My constituent, Mr. Caine, and Cluttons want those additional incinerators to deal with the backlog of material that must be incinerated as a result of the BSE crisis. I am sure the Minister agrees that such material must be dealt with carefully and in a way that cannot give rise to any further risk to public health.<br><br>
I can understand the Minister being reluctant to accept the drive from the European Community towards greater incineration, not just because it is not necessary in his book—and, indeed, in mine—but because he is obviously aware of the great difficulties that it will cause him in his ministerial capacity. But the examples that I have just given show a bona fide need for greater incineration. One of the companies has actually provided an incinerator but is not being allowed to use it, and the other is desperate to provide an incinerator to service one of the country's greatest livestock-producing areas.<br><br>
For the Committee's information, I should say that it has been necessary for this country to dispose of more than 1 million cattle carcases to comply with the BSE regulations. Even when there is an obvious need for incineration, there is a huge reluctance by local authorities and the public to accept the siting of incinerators in areas that operators and others regard as entirely appropriate. I hope that the Minister will recognise that there are particular difficulties in the livestock industry. I should, perhaps, draw the Committee's attention, finally, to the interests that I have declared in the Register of Members' Interests.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said before, this is my first meeting, so I was holding back a bit until the Euroscepticism came in. I want to take exception to one or two comments made by the Opposition.<br><br>
First, an enormous amount has been said about costs rather than benefits. That is wrong, as my hon. Friends have said. Secondly, the notion of subsidiarity has been mentioned again and again. About 90 per cent. of what my right hon. Friend the Minister said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0119">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
was to the effect that he would continue to put pressure on, and that if that pressure prevails he will get something different. That amounts to subsidiarity in the European context.<br><br>
I take exception, too, because my home town is Amsterdam. The Netherlands observes regulations well on these matters, far more so than the United Kingdom. Perhaps five, six or seven other countries come to mind who are far ahead of the United Kingdom in terms of implementation and national legislation on these matters. It is not right to say that the rest of Europe fails to do as well as this country. Some southern European nations do not, but when one is poor one has different priorities and different areas of expenditure. That sometimes means that important areas, such as the environment, are financed last.<br><br>
Subsidiarity and compliance come from different sides, and I do not believe that the Conservative view is well represented on this matter.</span></p>
<p>11.46 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow up on the admirable comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) by exploring the subject of incinerators a little further. That also follows on from the comments made by the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis) as incinerators neatly encapsulate one of the difficulties facing Euro-enthusiasts. Simply, traditions here are in many ways different. Something that has surprisingly, but spontaneously, popped up during the debate, and which is worth dwelling on for a moment, is that incinerators are a case in which our traditions happen to be different. Our tradition has been landfill, and the Minister pointed out earlier that landfill is not only the traditional way in which we deal with our waste, but that we do it rather well. We can feel not complacent, but rather pleased by that.<br><br>
Now, perhaps as part of the cost of membership of the European Union, a directive has come along, with the best of intentions and highest of aspirations, which may force us to switch to incineration rather than landfill as a principal means of dealing with our waste. On the face of it, one might say, "So what?" But that "so what" is important.<br><br>
The Minister did not pick up a point about which I asked him earlier, so I will have to press it now. Suppose that we find that we must increase our incinerators from the existing 12 to around 50 to meet the requirements of this measure. What will happen if our planning process, which the Minister does not propose to change, resists the establishment of that number of incinerators so that we fail to meet the requirements, no matter where they end up after negotiation? Our planning approach, which is very different from that in France, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk said, may—I would say that it is a certainty—make it impossible to deliver a sufficient number of incinerators, or sufficient capacity, to meet the measure's requirements.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
The examples given a few moments ago by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) illustrate that point all too well. We are ambivalent about this matter. We have not made up our minds on whether or not we think incineration is a good idea. It is one of those things that tends to seem rather good in theory until one is going to have one built in one's constituency. I do not know how many of our new colleagues have experienced attempts to locate an incinerator in their constituencies but, when that day comes, they will feel the heat in more ways than one.<br><br>
That brings me to another matter that has not been sufficiently dealt with: the trade off between the way in which incinerators deal with waste and the emissions produced by them. They are not a cost-free option: the cost in terms of environmental impact and emissions must be weighed in the balance.<br><br>
In their interventions this morning, some Labour Members have suggested that we are talking about absolutes—that these environmental matters are inevitable and imperative, and that everyone agrees on them—and that it is therefore not only undesirable but almost immoral to raise the question of cost. The implication is that we must comply with the directive whatever the cost. I have never agreed with that approach because voters at both local and national level, as mature people, should be presented with details of the likely costs and benefits. The majority of voters may feel that environmental measures are such a necessity that they are prepared to meet any cost. That is possible, although unlikely, but we should treat voters as adults and not imply that we have decided what is best for them and require them to pay the bill, however much it is.<br><br>
To give the Committee an example, it may please me to buy a motor vehicle with a very large engine and very poor fuel consumption, but I will make a judgment about that. I will pay the exorbitant tax on the fuel to feed that hungry beast because I am prepared to use my money for that purpose. That is the sort of thing writ small that we should write larger. We should say to the electorate, "Here are some propositions about what politicians think is good for you. Here is what we expect you, as taxpayers and consumers, to pay. We would like your approval for what we are doing." It is possible that voters would prefer to have a more polluted atmosphere and pay less.<br><br>
It worries me that Labour Members—not the Minister but his colleagues—have hinted that such a process should not take place. I think I know why; they share my suspicion that if we set it out in that way, as with some of the debates about the single currency, and the voters hear both sides of the argument, the Government might not like the answer they get from them. I trust the voters in these matters, as in so many others. I wonder if the Government do.<br><br>
Can we have as much clarity as possible? Will the Minister ask his officials to bend their minds to giving us much more detail and a range of costs that could reasonably arise from the measure? I also invite him to say how he thinks those costs will be met. Will they be met by taxpayers and consumers?</span></p>

<p>11.53 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Best <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To repeat myself for a moment, this is my first Committee, and perhaps those who have been in the House longer will forgive my credulity, but it seems to me that there is more on the agenda than appears in the papers. That is just part of the learning process but I thought that we would be discussing the content of the papers. It seems that we are, in part, but other members of the Committee are pursuing another agenda. In future, I shall be mindful of the fact that the way in which we proceed is often conditioned by the subjective views of other people about other issues outside the Committee's sphere.<br><br>
I volunteered to sit on the Committee because I am concerned about environmental issues. That does not result from some lazy, academic, passing moment in my life. I spent some time in local government before I entered the House, and I used to serve on a county council that had responsibility for the safe disposal of waste substances. I learned much about the desirability or otherwise of incineration landfill and about how popular it was to have a landfill site on one's doorstep or an incinerator in one's back garden. I need no lessons from the Opposition about such matters—I have lived that reality. I also know the associated material costs in pounds and pence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A cost of £250 million a year for the environment is, in this country, 1.4p per person per day. The costs should be considered that way as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Best</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that point. It is true to say that this country has a good record, but it has had it only since approximately 1974. There was a disastrous period before that—as a society we are still paying the penalties for not handling our waste products carefully, skilfully and with an eye on the future, and we shall pay those penalties for some time. Anyone who pretends otherwise has only to visit those landfill sites that are somewhat aged and to study the associated problems. Methane gathers under the floorboards of people who live adjacent to a landfill site, and that is not a healthy experience—it can have disastrous consequences. All that is needed is a spark in the wrong place and there are serious problems of a different kind.<br><br>
Our society has much to do to clean up not just the environment but our whole attitude to this problem. What do we do? There are costs—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the hon. Gentleman's concern about cleaning up the environment, does he agree that one of the worst offenders is the coal industry? Does he support the idea—which I hope is the Government's policy—of not giving taxpayers' money to existing coal mines to keep them in business?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Best</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I come from Leeds, which is in the heart of the Yorkshire coalfields. We are surrounded by slag heaps and overspills from mines that were carelessly closed down by the previous Administration. We are paying an appalling penalty for the environmental damage
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
that the Conservative party caused when it was in government. I am glad that the Conservatives are at last acknowledging their responsibility for those problems.<br><br>
I look forward to Britain playing a full role in the European Community cleaning up the European environment, of which we are a part. Anyone who pretends otherwise is living in cloud cuckoo land. We all know in out hearts that there are no boundaries when it comes to the damage that we are doing to the European environment. The problem has to be considered globally. If we can do the right thing in Europe there is greater hope of our being more influential in the world, especially because we must be successful.</span></p>
<p>11.58 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In this country, 90 per cent. of my industry has disappeared. In Holland, over 95 per cent. of that industry has disappeared, and in Germany probably more of it has gone. A major reason for that is the excessive environmental legislation that is imposed without thought of its consequences on firms and their employees. The result has not been a cleaner world.<br><br>
I take on board the comments of the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Mr. Best)—I am sure that all Committee members want a cleaner world environment. That is the key point. We are discussing not little England or Little Europe, but the world. If one imposes legislation without due consideration and without going into the details—we have hardly touched on the details this morning—firms will close. In the countries where such laws are imposed, firms and jobs will be lost.<br><br>
The key fact is that pollution will go elsewhere. If one goes to Pakistan today, one sees beautiful, modern, European-designed factories, but whereas in this country, Holland or Germany, they would have a substantial pollution plant, in Pakistan they have a hole in the wall. On Monday, the factories there are dyeing blue, and the brook outside runs blue; on Wednesdays they are dyeing red, and the brook runs red.<br><br>
There is a limit to the costs that can be imposed on industry. The directive is woolly and has not been throught through. I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk that possibly it originated in France because that country is advanced in incineration. Incineration is not, however, suited to wholesale imposition on the UK where we have other means of waste disposal.<br><br>
To return to my question to the Minister, it is highly significant how we define liquid and sludge. Would the Minister define yoghurt as a liquid or a sludge? He must think that technical question through. In the china clay industry, for instance, a great deal of waste goes to lagoons. I do not believe that to be environmentally dangerous. Lagooning is a satisfactory way of handling such waste. The Minister must think clearly about how a liquid or a sludge is defined because it is important.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0121">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Many aspects of the directive are woolly. Biodegradable waste sounds nice in principle, and we can imagine how it should be defined, but some industrial waste degrades over a long time. I urge the Minister to go back to industry and discuss such waste which would, in some cases, be dangerous to burn because of toxic gases and would be hugely expensive to incinerate.<br><br>
Tremendous woolliness surrounds the definition of inert and non-hazardous material. At the moment, those materials have to be separated, but there is no reason why they could not go to landfill together, and I urge the Minister to consider that.<br><br>
Woolliness also surrounds pre-treatment. Many industries treat their waste before sending it to landfill, but pre-treatment is not defined in the directive. I expect costly and unnecessary duplications and, in simple terms, fake pre-treatment which will be done purely to conform to the directive. That is a most important concern. Money will be wasted unless pretreatment is defined carefully.<br><br>
As for temporary storage, temporary deposits of waste prior to recovery are classified as landfills. Many industries store and retain waste for a year while it settles. The arrangement needs to be examined. Underground storage is not clearly defined, which is extraordinary because that woolliness will hurt many of our partners in Europe who store drummed liquid waste in mines and underground. It is amazing that that has not come up in the Minister's discussions, and he could help our European partners by raising it.<br><br>
The figures in the directive are based on the 1993 figures, which is totally arbitrary. As we have imposed a landfill tax, our figures for the past couple of years would be much more accurate. I urge the Minister to consider that.<br><br>
We have discussed the cost and figures were bandied about. The 50-year period is quite arbitrary. Not many people plan 50 years ahead. On what basis will that be organised, because it appears to be impractical? That arbitrary decision is typical of directives. It has been pushed through and puts a heavy imposition on industry in the future. People who plan ahead will then move out. We want a clean world, not a clean little England or a clean little Europe.<br><br>
I agree entirely with the Minister that the imposition of the time scale is completely unrealistic. He must try to find allies amongst our European partners for his attempt to extend the period, which is wholly impractical.<br><br>
Those are the main points that I wanted to highlight from a quick skim through the directive. There is a limit to the burdens that can be placed on industry. Unless that is recognised, industries will move away, resulting in a less prosperous Europe, a less prosperous Britain with less employment and a less clean world.</span></p>
<p>12.5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate over the last 35 minutes or so. I welcome the genuine interest on both sides of the Committee in the environmental issues and, quite properly, the cost implications—especially as they affect the UK—that the draft
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
directive raises. I also welcome the Minister and thank him for the courteous way in which he dealt with the questions in the first hour of the Committee's sitting. As someone who did his job some years ago, I sympathise with him over the processes he has to go through in his relations with the European Union. Even trying to elicit a response from some of his colleagues in the Council of Ministers and the European Commission can sometimes be frustrating. I am glad that we have an opportunity to debate the directive in this Committee, and I look forward to debating other matters with the Minister in due course.<br><br>
Having said that, while I knew that the draft directive was seriously flawed when I came to the Committee, I did not know how regrettably little interest the Minister appears to have in the effects of the directive on this country. I especially deplore the fact that the Government seem not to have attempted to quantify the ways in which the directive will place a larger burden on Britain than on many of our main European competitors.<br><br>
When I raised that point, the Minister referred to some of the southern European member states, where, indeed, the burden could be substantial on a proportional basis. The truth, however, is that we will be at a substantial disadvantage in comparison with our main European competitors. It would be entirely appropriate for the Government to commission some studies on the extra costs that this country's businesses, consumers and local authorities will have to bear.<br><br>
I did not expect the Minister to run up the white flag in public and at such an early stage over the crucial aspect of the directive. I welcome the Minister's recognition that the targets for cutting biodegradable waste should be removed from the directive—he is right about that and it is almost universally supported by the Committee. Almost in the same breath, however, the Minister said that that objective would not be achieved, and a compromise would have to be reached. It is regrettable that that has been publicly announced—it is not likely to achieve a satisfactory outcome for this country.<br><br>
The directive embodies the very worst features of the European Union's approach to environmental matters. It picks an issue and then examines it in isolation. It produces a superficial solution, involving the imposition of a rigid blueprint across the whole of the European Union, regardless of the relevant differences between individual member states. That approach takes absolutely no account of how and whether the resources needed to comply with the directive could be better applied to the achievement of environmental goals.<br><br>
The figures of £3 billion or £7 billion are the Minister's figures, not European Union figures—they are from the Department of the Environment's memorandum. If we asked businesses, consumers, taxpayers and local authorities to spend £3 billion on environmental improvement, I do not think that the answer would necessarily be the one that my right hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0122">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst suggested. I am sorry that he is not here to hear this part of the argument.<br><br>
There is a growing interest in environmental issues and a growing willingness for people to pay some of the price. An interesting debate at the Confederation of British Industry conference this week suggested that British business is willing to see challenging targets set for environmental improvement, and, if necessary, to pay some of the costs to achieve it.<br><br>
If we said that we will spend £3 billion on environmental improvements, would we say that the most effective way to spend that money is to phase out rapidly the process of landfilling biodegradable waste? Of course we would not.<br><br>
The Minister bravely tried to defend the measure by referring to the environmental gains—there will be some environmental gains from phasing out landfill, which I do not dispute. Methane gases are important in contributing to climate change, but if we were to spend £3 billion on trying to reduce greenhouse gas emmissions in the United Kingdom, we would not do it in that way. There are far better ways.<br><br>
Imagine how much research could be undertaken into developing renewable sources of energy, if we spent £3 billion. How much do the private sector and the Government combined now spend on research into renewable sources of energy? A tiny fraction of the amount that the directive will cost.<br><br>
Imagine how much could be done to improve energy efficiency. The figure dwarfs the amount now spent by the Government on improving energy efficiency. Imagine how much could be done to develop more fuel-efficient motor car engines, which vastly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.<br><br>
The measure is an extraordinary diversion of valuable resources, the effect of which will not be to improve the environment, as some Labour Members suggested. It will remove the opportunity to achieve much better improvements to the environment if we approached the issue rationally.<br><br>
The directive is ill conceived in its purpose, badly thought-out in its detail, excessively costly to implement and unlikely ever to be effectively enforced. Opposition Members yield to no one—and certainly not to the Labour party—in our passionate commitment to achieving a better environment. Our record in making progress towards that was good, and widely recognised as such, as many non-governmental organisations operating in the environmental sector have publicly acknowledged.<br><br>
I recognise that some—but not all—of the further environmental advances that we want to achieve will involve additional costs to business, consumers and taxpayers. As I have said, there is a willingness to meet some of those costs. However, when we contemplate actions that involve such costs, it is essential that decisions are made, first, on the basis of a proper scientific assessment of the options, and, secondly, after an objective, careful and rational analysis of the costs and benefits of any proposal.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
The directive, like far too many proposals emanating from the European Commission, fails both those tests. It is therefore all the more necessary for the Committee to draw attention to those failures, and for the Government to fight their corner, and not only for Britain, although that is important. They must fight their corner for Europe as well: bad proposals such as this one give the concept of the European Union—deservedly—a bad name.<br><br>
I regard myself—unlike some of my colleagues—as a moderate pro-European, but even I am forced into rabid Euro-scepticism by the absurdity of proposals from the European Commission when they are presented without scientific justification or consideration of better alternative uses of the resources that would be gobbled up.<br><br>
The European Union should not introduce such intrusive legislation. The Government must fight their corner for the environment: this is such a bad proposal. The Commission should abandon the proposal on the grounds of subsidiarity, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow suggested.<br><br>
Most environmental issues cross national boundaries but the extent to which landfill issues cross national boundaries is extremely limited. Apart from gas emissions, there is virtually no impact from landfill site beyond the immediate neighbourhood. It is extraordinary that the document claims to take account of local conditions; it covers an issue that is almost entirely local and the idea of a rigid and uniform approach across the whole of Europe is absurd.<br><br>
A further problem with the draft directive is that, as in so many other areas, the European Commission has unbounded enthusiasm for proposing new legislation, but shows no appetite for enforcing existing regulations. What is the point of introducing more onerous requirements on landfill sites when three member states cannot even enforce the existing, much lighter regime? If the commission is seriously concerned about landfill instead of its usual ambitious empire-building, why is it not calling Greece, Ireland and Portugal to account for failing to comply with directive 75/442? What steps is the Minister taking to encourage better enforcement of the existing regulations by the commission? Even the European Parliament may have a role. Instead of throwing out the proposals on the extraordinary grounds that they are inadequate, it should examine the failure of member states to enforce the existing regulations.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will explain the Government's future tactics on the proposal and what further steps they will take to protect Britain's right to continue using co-disposal. I hope that he will tell us what steps he plans to take to ensure that the special geological characteristics of this country are reflected in the details of the directive when it goes through its next stages. Will he assure us that the Government will throw their full weight behind getting the directive defeated if it cannot be improved in the way that even he acknowledges is necessary?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
As Labour MEPs are not allowed to think for themselves—if they do, they are not allowed to say that they do—will the Government instruct their MEPs to take the appropriate action if the proposal gets as far as the European Parliament? Will the Government carry out the assessment that I have asked for on how much extra cost will arise in this country? Will the Minister confirm, as he hinted, that if the proposal goes ahead the substantial bulk of the cost will fall on local authorities? Will he give a guarantee now that the revenue support grant will be increased to cover the extra cost which local authorities will face, or is he saying that the burden will have to be borne by council tax payers? Will the Minister and his Department start consulting now, in case his efforts to defeat the directive are unsuccessful—he seems to think they will be—on the new planning guidance that will be needed if we are to have 50 new incinerators in this country? He will know, as do many members of the Committee, how long the planning application process is likely to be for something as controversial as an incinerator. It is all the more important, therefore, that guidance should be prepared—and that consultation take place on such guidance—on the considerations to be taken into account on incinerator applications. Does the Minister understand that any equivocation on his part on any of the issues raised today will be viewed with great alarm in Parliament and outside? That would be a sign that he is reluctant to defend the interests of this country and that he does not genuinely care about finding ways of using scarce resources to improve the environment.</span></p>
<p>12.19 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can agree with at least one comment of the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo)—we have had a very good debate. It has been informed and generally free of acrimony and rancour. A number of relevant questions were asked and I share many of the concerns raised. I shall try to deal in the same spirit with the questions that have been raised.<br><br>
I thank the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk for his generous comments. He was concerned that the United Kingdom would be disproportionately disadvantaged, and saw the proposal as benefiting France in particular. I am not sure why he thinks that; as I said, most of the tough regulations required are already in place in the UK. We do not have a large number of polluting sites that need to be substantially improved, except in regard to methane—as I said, we can improve methane capture from about a third of our sites to as much as 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. On that basis, I expect other countries, including large countries such as France, to find themselves at least as severely impacted as the UK, and probably more so.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman's point about the need to secure compliance—something that the hon. Member for South Suffolk also mentioned. That is obviously important. We have been arguing for improved compliance on the part of those states that are at present failing in landfill regulation. However, if we want secure compliance, we need a directive with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
tight standards. The problem is that legislation in a number of other member states is much weaker than it is in this country.<br><br>
I can assure the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk that we will be pressing for strong compliance, and I also agree that we want the most environmentally sensitive option. I will continue to argue that well-engineered, well-managed landfill with proper methane capture is in many cases environmentally preferable to a great expansion of incineration.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ludlow is certainly right that the increased demand for incinerators is due partly to BSE. Incineration of meat and bone meal for the over30-month scheme, as well as of BSE-infected carcases, is at the heart of the matter. The Department has given planning authorities advice on that issue, and we are trying to encourage current incinerators to meet the standards.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned Cluttons. I must not be drawn into too much detail, but I am advised that as carcase incinerators, Cluttons has had previous operating problems under part B authorisations granted by the local authority. However, I think that the hon. Gentleman was citing Cluttons only as an example, and I take his more general point.<br><br>
To pick up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis), Opposition Members have been keen to concentrate almost exclusively on the question of cost. It is perfectly proper to mention the cost, but it is not proper to dwell exclusively on one side of the equation, and I thank my hon. Friend for making that clear.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, who has now left, raised other questions. I do not accept that we will not be able to achieve an increase in incinerators through the planning process. It would certainly be difficult to get an excessive number through that process, but I do not anticipate that result.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman, more than anyone else, asked about cost. I repeat that it is not, as he said, immoral for him to raise the question of cost; it is simply inequitable to raise cost questions without considering benefits. We are trying to reduce cost by alowing more time to build up markets for recycling, which should produce income to offset costs. Industrial waste minimisation has been shown to be cost effective—in the Aire and Calder project, for example.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West emphasised the importance of cleaning up the environment—rightly, given his constituency. Further to what he said in response to the hon. Member for South Suffolk, we realise that there is tension arising from the continued operation of the coal industry and consequent sulpher dioxide—which is being dealt with by the acidification strategy—acid rain emissions and CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub -->.<br><br>
The Government do not take the view that the right answer to the problem is to continue to decimate the coal communities and almost entirely wipe out the coal industry in this country. That is partly because of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0124">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
appalling social costs to the communities involved, which are almost uniquely dependent on coal, but also because we believe in a diversified energy strategy.<br><br>
It would be unwise not to take advantage of the coal reserves and to depend almost exclusively on gas. There are ways to reconcile the tensions, including the development of clean coal technology. I accept that there are financial and practical problems in that but, rather than taunt us with the environmental consequences of coal-burning emissions, it would be more reasonable for Conservative Members to take account of those communities and consider how thay can be kept in existence in an environmentally sensitive way.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Patterson) made some interesting comments. He is right to say that we should look closely at the small print and I accept that this Committee's proceedings are not the best way to deal with the definitions in depth. The matters to which he refers are being dealt with by working groups at official level. I assure him that the wording is examined in great detail—there is no question of not looking with great scrutiny at the precise implications of the exact text.<br><br>
On pre-treatment, it states in article 2(g) that treatment is broadly defined as
<br><blockquote><p>"the Physical, chemical of biological processes, including sorting, that change the characteristics of the waste in order to reduce its volume or hazardous nature, facilitate its handling or enhance recovery."</p></blockquote>
There is not much doubt what it means; the question is whether it is required.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned underground landfill. As he rightly said, it is not yet fully set out in the directive. It has already been discussed by the working group, but will need to be debated further. He referred to a 50-year timetable. That is only a steer and will depend on a particular site and its remaining potential to pollute. That fits in well with our licensing system; under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, each landfill must demonstrate that it will no longer pollute before an operator can hand in his licence.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the distinction between liquid and sludge. I must look into that, although I am relieved to know that it will soon be discussed by technical experts. A definition may be included in the directive or be handled later in the associated technical advisory committees. I assure him that we shall be aiming to find a definition that is not so rigorous as to be disproportionate in its effects. Such a way of proceeding should underpin all our attitudes to the directive.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman spoke more generally, on the political level, about the unemployment and cost consequences. I have made no attempt to conceal them. Indeed, I am alarmed, which is why we seek changes. The hon. Gentleman is not right to say, however, that environmental legislation causes firms to close. He put forward the rather old-fashioned view that environmental policy is bad for business, bad for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
employment and bad for the Treasury. [<i>Interruption.</i>] No, the hon. Gentleman did not say that; if I go too far, I am happy to withdraw that statement.<br><br>
There is another side to the argument. As was mentioned earlier, there is a huge market in environmental technology. It is estimated that by the end of the decade it will be worth about £400 billion. Again, the United States, Germany and Japan are in the lead; we have only 6 per cent. of that market and we need to increase our share. The hon. Gentleman would not deny that economies have to change and adapt. Old industries change and new industries take their place. Environment is not a job destroyer; in a successful economy, it should create jobs.<br><br>
I am sorry to take so much of the Committee's time, but I respond now to the hon. Member for South Suffolk. Before gathering steam, he made some charitable comments about the manner in which I dealt with hon. Members' questions. He then talked about my lack of tactical wisdom. I simply point out that the question of what happens if we do not change has already been discussed. The issue is already on the table. It was discussed at the Council and several members were talking about an extended time scale. It is perfectly clear that if we cannot obtain a major change in the format of the directive, we must consider allowing countries more time to adapt. That is standard practice, so I am giving nothing away. I was surprised, however, that the hon. Member for South Suffolk should invite me to tell the Committee my future tactics, having only five minutes before condemned me for doing exactly that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk asked whether this was the best way to spend our money. No one denies that it is a great deal of money, but the hon. Gentleman wanted to know whether scarce capital would be diverted into expenditure that could not be justified. That was the thrust of his remarks. First, as I said at great length, although the costs are high there are substantial benefits. Not only that, but the benefits will have a cost tag that will be required to be paid under different strategies, such as climate change and the protection of groundwater supplies.<br><br>
On a slightly more political level, the hon. Member for South Suffolk said that the previous Government had an excellent environmental record. I find that a little difficult to take. My view is that my predecessor, the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), had genuine environmental instincts. In many ways I respect the policies that he put forward. He was always good value for money, he acted with drive and enthusiasm and he believed in what he was doing. But he acted alone. He was not supported in Cabinet because the Department of Trade and Industry and other Departments did not share his view. Although Departments continue to differ about details and about how far and fast we should go, the Labour Government have a much broader ideological agreement about the need to put environment at the heart of policymaking. That is what we are doing and will continue to do.<br><br>

I do not agree with the hon. Member for South Suffolk that the proposals are bad. They are flawed in some respects, but much is good. Hon Members will be grateful to hear that I shall not spell them out in detail, as I set them out at the beginning of the debate. There is much that is good, and where the proposals are flawed we will fight our corner, as I have made clear.<br><br>
The hon. Member of South Suffolk asked whether I would ensure that the directive could be defeated. I would like to see parts of article 5 removed, not the defeat of the whole thing. I shall continue to struggle hard to get that done.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made a mistake by referring to the European Parliament. In fact, the European Parliament is gung-ho to go a great deal further even than the Commission. It would like the time scale to be reduced. One of our problems is that we are fighting our corner within the Council while knowing that the European Parliament has a majority of MEPs—including many from the UK—who insist that we should go further. That is the reality of the politics of this matter, and we have to take it into account. We are in a system of co-determination and we cannot ignore attitudes in the European Parliament. An opinion will be presented there, probably early next year, and we cannot ignore it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo.</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just for clarification, I referred to the European Parliament because I believed that its time would be better spent chasing enforcement of existing European landfill regulations, which have been flagrantly breached by some countries. Secondly, I hoped that the Minister's lackeys in the European Parliament would be instructed by the Government to prevent any further absurd rejection of the proposal on the grounds that it is inadequate. It should be made clear to them that they should object to the proposal because it goes too far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I am grateful for that intervention. The European Parliament and its Members have a robust independence and certainly are not subject to instruction. I do not know whether
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
those who represent the Conservative philosophy in its manifold forms are lackeys, but our MEPs certainly are not. They will take their view and will express it as forcefully as they already have.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman on enforcement. We want better enforcement and have argued for it with the Commission. I agree that Greece, Ireland and Portugal are three of the main offenders, and I could mention two others. We want strict enforcement, but that is no reason for saying that we do not want higher environmental standards, which will have much more impact across Europe than in the UK. We will demand, too, that those higher standards should be enforced.<br><br>
I have spoken at sufficient length. I am not going to be equivocal. Nothing that I have said today is equivocal. I am extremely clear about what I want and about what is right for the UK. I am equally clear that I will continue fighting for the best deal that we can get on this directive, which, while flawed in places, is still, on balance, desirable.</span></p>
