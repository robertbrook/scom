	<p>[	<i>Relevant document: European Community Document No. 6260/98, further proposed amendments to Annex V of the draft Water Policy Framework Directive.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Angela Eagle)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to take part in the debate on European Community water policy. I am sure that none of us is in any doubt about the significance of water policy. Water is of the utmost importance for human life and health, for aquatic ecosystems and for the quality of the environment in its broadest sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Water is also of tremendous economic importance. A great deal of water policy and legislation is set or influenced at European level. We must strike a balance between different needs for water and different ways of meeting those needs. Therefore, it is vital that we get Community water policy right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving to the specific subject of today's debate, I will introduce the Commission's proposal for a directive which establishes a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, or, to use its less cumbersome title, the water framework directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed water framework directive is a major piece of Community environmental legislation. It has a high profile, having been prepared at the specific request of the Council and the European Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive goes to the heart of Community water policy and offers a pioneering approach for developing water legislation in line with advances in scientific and technical knowledge. The emphasis is no longer only on chemical standards—those lists of numbers that often characterised older water legislation. By contrast, the directive encourages a broader ecological perspective that takes account of the chemical and physical aspects of the water environment. It measures net effects on the health of biological populations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive will also overhaul existing Community water legislation, much of which was passed in the mid-1970s and is now out of date. It will provide a framework which will accommodate newer legislation, such as the urban waste water treatment directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The water framework directive has a broad scope. It will establish a common approach to environmental objectives for all ground and surface waters in the Community. It will also establish a common method of implementation, based on the principle of river basin management. Its objectives on sustainable water use will require member states to bring their rivers, lakes,
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
estuaries and coastal waters up to a standard that allows typical biological populations to survive and reproduce. That will ensure that water of a suitable quality is provided for the various uses to which the water environment is put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quantity objectives for ground waters have sustainability at their heart. Member states will have to restrict abstraction to quantities that do not result in long-term depletion of ground-water levels or significant ecological damage to surface water systems that are connected to ground-waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there are challenges associated with such a wide-ranging and ambitious directive. We need to ensure that we do not sign up to unnecessary or impracticable objectives, and so the emphasis on framework is important. We must strike the right balance between European Community prescriptiveness and a flexibility that will enable member states to implement the directive using their own systems. There must also be sufficient comparability between member states for us to be confident that we are working towards common goals. We must make sure that the directive provides a lasting framework that we can use to protect Europe's water for the foreseeable future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal has been achieved during negotiations on the framework directive, especially since the United Kingdom assumed the EU presidency. We still have some way to go but, subject to the views of this House and another place, we are optimistic that we will make real progress on bringing this important directive to a satisfactory conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will now address the Commission's amended proposal for the bathing water directive. In 1995, the House of Lords covered the ground thoroughly: they had a full debate and the Select Committee on European Communities produced two reports. Their Lordships drew attention to the need for a full discussion on acceptable levels of health protection for sea bathers. However, they were unconvinced that there was justification for imposing on the general public significantly higher costs in order to reduce somewhat the risks of self-limiting illness associated with bathing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of the available evidence on health effects, the previous Government shared those views, and the present Government see no reason for taking a significantly different stance. The Government support revision of the directive where it would allow better targeting of resources without weakening standards of protection. However, we do not believe that the revision proposed by the Commission in 1994, nor the 1997 amendments, meets those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the understanding that the directive deals chiefly with the protection of public health, we question the health-related scientific basis for the new mandatory quality requirements proposed for some of the microbiological parameters. Those requirements would pose considerable compliance problems—and expense—for all member states. It is surely significant that, since publication of the proposal, none of the successive presidencies has given the proposal sufficient priority to include it on the Environment Council agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's amended proposal, which contains some of the amendments from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
consideration by the European Parliament, includes even tighter mandatory standards and takes little account of previous criticisms. That proposal would pose even more difficulties and expense, and it is likely that the majority of member states will have similar objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been considerable opposition to the proposed revision. Moreover, during its presidency no member state has taken up that revision since its introduction in 1994. The Commission should therefore seriously consider withdrawing the proposal. It should then begin proper consultations on what member states would like to see in any new revision. It should seek to improve the revision's scientific basis, and should consider a new approach that involves better consultation between the Commission and member states, and which takes fully into account states' experience of implementing the existing directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would now be pleased to answer any questions that hon. Members may have on either of the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 at the latest for questions to the Minister. I should remind Committee members that questions should be brief, and asked one at a time. I note that most of those present are regular Committee members. They will therefore know that several questions may be asked by a single member, provided that they are asked on different occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a regular member of the Committee, but I shall ask one or two basic questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During her comments on the framework directive, the Minister said that the negotiations have achieved a great deal. In the light of the reservations that her explanatory memorandum set out, can she be more specific about those achievements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members must bear in mind that negotiations are still under way, so we do not yet have a final text of the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased that references to the marine environment have been deleted from the directive. That was our greatest worry, because we felt that its inclusion would prove impractical. We can therefore concentrate on the categories to which I referred in my opening statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have restricted the directive's scope to estuarial, coastal, ground-water and surface waters. During our presidency, the conceptual centre of the framework directive was greatly developed. As I hinted in my opening statement, that concept is based on the principle of rivern basin management, which takes an holistic view of a river's water environment. River basin management authorities will be created, which will examine how surface water activity in a given area might affect ground-waters, or vice versa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the annexes to the directive are very technical. It is right that they are contained in the directive, and not left to expert committees to draft after the directive has been adopted. Many of the annexes successfully tackle the question of how the concepts of ecological health and chemical health might be identified. In doing so, they move away from the long
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
list of biological quality standards that has characterised previous European Union legislation. That is a real step forward in the measurement and maintenance of water quality and health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not made the progress that we should like in some areas. However, we have made a good start in taking away some of the more impractical parts of the original basis of the framework directive. We have put flesh on the bones in areas such as ecological health and chemical quality by employing the new information and scientific and technical expertise about water that has arisen since the original European Union water quality legislation was put on the statute book in the 1970s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister does not mind my suggesting that answers, as well as questions, should be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I declare a local interest. I represent the constituency of Scarborough and Whitby, which includes 52 miles of North sea coastline. There is a centre of excellence that specialises in marine biology and microbiology at the university college in Scarborough. In preparation for this morning's debate, I had a discussion with some of the academics there. They told me that they were concerned about the timetable for implementation and how it will be affected by emerging data about climate change and global warming. Will the Minister respond to that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The timetable for implementation is still under discussion. It is a vital issue in terms of the directive's costs and practicalities, and we are aware of the sensitivities involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the incidence of drinking waterborne and bathing water-borne illness increased over the past two or three years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the answer to that. I presume that the hon. Gentleman is referring to gastroenteritis and similar illnesses that result from bathing. I am not sure how the distinction is drawn between those illnesses and other relevant types of illness such as food poisoning. I shall endeavour to find an answer to the hon. Gentleman's question. However, I can assure him that nothing dramatic has happened, because we would know about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Humble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn), I too, declare an interest as the representative of a coastal constituency—Blackpool, North and Fleetwood. The quality of bathing water in the area has hit the headlines locally, and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is aware of the issue because I have written to her many times about it. I was interested to hear her comments on the Government's reasons for choosing not to take up the revision of the bathing water directive at this stage. Before the Government move on to the detailed negotiations that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has mentioned, my constituents would like to receive assurances about the existing directive and its guarantees on health and water purity. Can she give me any such assurances about the existing directive and about the future negotiations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the existing directive has to be put into effect. The Government are pressing water companies to ensure high compliance rates, as did the previous Government. I can assure my hon. Friend that 88 per cent. of this country's designated bathing waters were of an acceptable or good standard this year, compared with last year's figure of 90 per cent. That is approximately the European average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The revisions to the bathing water directive should aim to increase the cleanliness and safety of bathing waters. The potential changes that are before the Committee today, which include tighter mandatory standards on faecal streptococci and enteroviruses, will not do the job effectively. That is why neither this Government nor the previous Government supported them. However, in a more roundabout way the directive, if we can get it agreed and up and running, will also affect bathing waters. In the end, water tends to make its way to the sea, so cleaning up the river basins and making them healthy ecologically and chemically will have a run-on effect on bathing waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share some of the worries about health issues expressed by the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson). The 1994 House of Lords report found no health-related evidence for tightening the EU bathing standards directive. Have any new factors in the health domain struck the Government as providing a compelling case for tightening those standards? Will the Minister say what other factors the Government consider must be borne in mind in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that any Members of Parliament would say that they opposed raising the quality of bathing water, drinking water or any of the waters around the country. However, the question is whether the 1994 EU bathing water directive and the suggestions from the European Parliament in 1997 are sufficient for the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government consider that the measurements chosen for the bathing water directive by the European Parliament and the European Commission do not do the job. We have particular reservations about the much tighter mandatory limits on enterovirus, which is very small and hard to spot: sampling water is not guaranteed to produce conclusive results. Much more important is that water should contain no pathogens damaging to human health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government agree with the 1995 House of Lords report, which stated that the mandatory standard for enterovirus measurement is a poor gauge of whether water poses a risk of ill health. We believe coliforms offer a much closer guide to possible problems with bathing waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The worldwide debate about global warming and climatic change has many angles and is affected by many of the decisions taken by Governments. Will my hon. Friend explain how the water framework directive might contribute to that discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new concept of ecological health offers a much better way to decide whether a water
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
environment is safe than can a measure of chemical health alone. A safe water environment will permit a healthy ecology, but plant, insect and animal life will decline in a heavily polluted environment. The concept of ecological health is a better guide than a mere list of chemicals for which one must search in a given volume of water to say whether it meets the required standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes, however, we must measure what chemicals are present in water. We expect that the framework directive will contain a priority list of toxic substances, such as organophosphates and pesticides, which may be put on a list and then measured for. The twin concepts of ecological health and chemical quality together allow us to assess whether we have a healthy water environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The step change implied in the concept behind this directive is that it covers the whole topic of river basin management. It is not confined to a stretch of water in a certain area, but includes ground water and the health of rivers, estuaries and coastal waters. It is a huge improvement on the old European Union directives of the 1970s, which merely contained lists of chemicals, pollutants and pathogens that had to be found and measured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The water policy directive obviously has financial implications. The Minister undertook that consultants would carry out a study of compliance cost assessment, and that was due last month. Does she now have the conclusions of the study and can she apply figures to the assessment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly reasonable and sensible question. However, it is difficult to answer it because negotiations on the framework directive have not been completed. I hinted earlier that two keys to the potential final costs of the directive are any possible derogations and the timetable under which the new standards are expected to be applied. The longer the time frame that member states have to put the directive into effect, the more that costs can be spread over time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have cost compliance figures because the directive is still under negotiations. However, the hon Gentleman was right to suggest that consultants are working on an assessment at the moment. They are having to make heroic assumptions about what might or might not appear in the final directive. As soon as the directive has been negotiated, we shall report to Parliament on what the costs will be. We cannot do that, however, until the negotiations have been completed and we have answers to questions on derogations and on the timetable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot declare the same interest as my hon. Friends; my constituency is about as inland as one can get. None the less, an important river runs through it and it contains three breweries that depend upon the quality of water available to them. Water quality is important to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the directive, but I would like reassurance on quantity issues. For example, how will it prevent over-abstraction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Details of the technical annexes to the directive are being negotiated. They will help us to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
measure the extent to which abstraction can continue in a given area without causing damage to the surroundings countryside. The directive treats quantity issues seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For surface waters, abstraction can take place only if sufficient water is left to sustain typical biological communities in the area. As we are dealing with the entire European Union and different waters and different ecological environments, abstraction issues must be assessed by the new river basin management authorities. They will come up with a view of the ordinary signs of health to look for in an area. Abstraction will not be allowed to take place if it damages typical communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For ground-waters, quantity must not be permanently depleted by abstracting more than is recharged. Nor must abstraction lead to associated surface waters falling below good status or cause significant damage to terrestrial ecosystems dependent on ground-water. We must consider the interrelationships between ground and surface waters, take a view of what is healthy in a given area and then monitor the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am correct in thinking that it is the Minister' s first appearance before the Committee, I take the opportunity of welcoming her to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pursue a couple of questions asked earlier. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) asked about the costs of compliance with the directive. The Minister will concede that they will be considerable and will run into billions of pounds. My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire asked whether statistics were available on the incidence of illness caused by bathing or drinking water. Therefore, does the Minister share my fear that the Committee is considering the expenditure of a huge amount of taxpayers' money without full justification. If she cannot produce figures to demonstrate the need for the measures, how can she justify the huge expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome; this is indeed my first appearance before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My answer to the hon. Gentleman's question will be in two parts. We are presently negotiating the framework directive. We shall not know what the costs will be until the final shape of the directive is agreed. It will then be for member states to consider the costs and to decide whether to support the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The move from negotiations to a set text does not assume that the directive will automatically be passed. That comes once the final shape of the directive has been decided. Work is continuing on those matters that have already been settled, but the key to cost assessment on the water framework directive is the question of timetable and derogation that I mentioned earlier. As agreement has not yet been reached on those matters, we cannot give the Committee an assessment of the cost: it would be a guess. I would rather wait until those negotiations are completed and then give the House a proper and more accurate assessment of the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman clearly knows, in respect of the bathing water directive and other EU legislation, that £2
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
billion has already been spent on improving water quality. The urban waste water treatment directive envisages costs of about £8 billion to upgrade sewage facilities between now and 2010. Once we know the costs, we shall have to decide what level of improvements we can support. Deciding where the balance should best be drawn between the cost to the customer and the assured quality of the water environment will obviously involve discussions with Ofwat. We cannot do that yet, as we do not know the final shape of the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Best</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent a landlocked constituency—Leeds, North-West—which encompasses part of lower Wharfedale. I am pleased to say that the area has the benefit of a beautiful, fresh river, the Wharfe, running through it. I am concerned about sustainable development. Gravel has been extracted from the river valley, and the gravel beds have since filled with water. Sailing is allowed on some of those pools. Can my hon. Friend say what the directive will do about sustainable growth, and whether that sustainable development will have a consequential effect on the quality of the water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directive is consistent with ideas of sustainable development. I hope that hon. Members realise that, because of the new concepts associated with how the directive is being negotiated—for example on ecological health, which is very much about sustainability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Environmental objectives are detailed in annex V. They are essentially about sustainability. They require water quality and quantity to be such as to allow the survival and reproduction of typical biological populations, and for water abstraction to be matched by recharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be recognised that most water courses in Europe have been affected by human development. Flood defence, navigation and power generation play an important part in economic development and cannot be wished away. Those modifications must be recognised and their effect reflected in the objectives set for particular water courses. It is a question of seeing what suits each area, but avoiding massive damage—accidental or otherwise—by the overuse of a resource.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my earlier question, as there are obviously no screamingly alarming health problems in the United Kingdom related to water, do the Government have figures for other countries, which may have had problems with illnesses provoked by water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot expect me to be an annexe of the people's health problems in the whole of Europe. I shall write to him on that issue, too. He must remember that we are talking about health effects and the bathing water directive. Although we are not discussing it in Committee today, the urban waste water treatment directive is about how to avoid pollution from sewage pipes and how to dispose of waste water to minimise the effects on human health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework directive that we are discussing is more about the sustainable use of water as a resource; it is not directly about health. However, if we get it right,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
water that is used everywhere should be cleaner and there should be less pollution as a secondary effect of some of the directive's aims that are being negotiated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobbin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister touched briefly on the central point of my question. Most members of the Committee have sewage treatment plants in their constituencies and a House of Commons report was recently published on such plants. What is the Government's attitude to the report's recommendations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be pleased to know that the Government will be responding officially to the report's recommendations during the next few weeks. I can tell him from memory that the Government have now announced the designation of nine inland bathing waters, something that has not been done before. It was one of the direct recommendations of the report. However, my hon. Friend will have to wait until the Government's formal response to deal with each recommendation made by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I return the Minister to the matter of financial implications? She kindly made available the explanatory memorandum dated 20 January, paragraph 21 of which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not possible at that time to provide a compliance cost … However, the Government has commissioned consultants to undertake a study … The report is due in March 1998.</p></blockquote>
The Minister explained that one problem is the lack of clarity and definition from the Commission. Without being pedantic, I should like to know whether the position has changed since the explanatory memorandum was published? If it has, it would have been useful for us to have known that the study was still being carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister explained that Parliament would ultimately know the details of the compliance cost. In what form will we be informed of the cost? Will it be contained in a statement or will its details be placed in the Library? How will we find out about the compliance cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am told that the consultant's final report is not yet finished. The hon. Gentleman must understand that negotiations are going on that could change the compliance costs for two of the most important areas, as I mentioned previously. Further work is being undertaken, but we have every intention of making available in the Library information on the compliance cost, the consultant's report and the costs that we expect the framework directive to put us under when it has been fully negotiated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Humble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a non-scientist, I read the detailed papers with increasing bewilderment, trying to work out what the different microbiological parameters meant and whether faecal streptococci should be in numerical parameters and whether it would do any good if they were. From reading the report and from my discussions with North West Water, I know that scientific advice changes, whether it is about measuring the quality of bathing water or about sewage treatment. When the revision to the bathing water directive takes place, can the Minister assure me that there will be sufficient
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
flexibility to deal with changes in scientific advice and in recommendations for either measuring the quality of bathing water or for dealing with sewage treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend puts her finger on an important point. It is difficult, especially with what are almost arbitrary decisions on mandatory standards, to ensure that they add up to healthy bathing water. That has been one of our problems with the bathing water directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an hon. Member representing the north-west myself, I share my hon. Friend's concern about the beaches of the north-west, and I can tell her that the Environment Agency is now working closely with North West Water to see how they can improve compliance standards, which have fallen well below those achieved everywhere else in the country. The Government prefer a more holistic view of measurement. The framework directive contains a priority list of toxic chemicals, for which it is important to measure, but it is also important to check whether things are still living in water—that is a good sign of whether it is healthy. It is harder to determine that by means of a list of streptococci and enteroviruses, for example. However, if coliforms are present, we have problems with water quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Humble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pursuing the question of the cost-effectiveness of what is proposed, does the Minister agree that in this age, in which there is a great feeling that everything should be made 100 per cent. safe—our food, drink, bathing waters, aeroplanes, ships and so on—we are in danger of chasing rainbows? If we make drinking water and bathing water 100 per cent. safe, there is a great danger that our natural resistance will be reduced. We will never arrive at a utopia in which there is no sickness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree that, short of living in a bubble, we will never achieve an utterly safe environment—if we did, we would probably bore ourselves to death. Proportionality is important. One of our problems with the changes to the bathing water directive proposed in 1994 by the Commission and the subsequent, even tighter, proposals made by the European Parliament in 1997 is that we do not think that even if tougher mandatory standards were met for enteroviruses, for example, that that would make much difference. That would involve huge expenditure to little or no benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it is important to apply a reasonable cost-benefit analysis to all such matters before we decide whether we support proposed EU directives. As president of the EU, we are ensuring that proportionality and cost form an integral part of the negotiations on the proposed water framework directive. Worries about the point raised by the hon. Gentleman make us sceptical of the usefulness of proceeding with changes currently proposed to the bathing water directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend my hon. Friend on her scepticism. I recently spoke to a group in my constituency known as the Sons of Neptune, which is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
sceptical of scientific advice and the movement—literally, the tidal movement—involved in the subject. I know that my hon. Friend will be joining us in Scarborough for a national parks conference at the end of the summer. Is she prepared to come for a swim with me, and perhaps with the Sons of Neptune, off Scarborough, to demonstrate her confidence in the water there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend tempts me enormously. I would feel safe in the waters off Scarborough, as I was born and grew up in Bridlington and know the area well. I am not sure that I would feel safe with the Sons of Neptune.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman would be inclined to join hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be facetious to say that the Minister will not have the opportuity to bathe off the fair coastal town of Blackpool for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, her party's policy on that will change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return briefly to the financial implications. Can the Minister give us a rough idea of who will pay the compliance costs—will it be the Government, water authorities or local government? How will the cost of implementing the directive be spread?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, customers will pay their bills and water authorities will invest, and there might be some opportunity costs of not abstracting. Given the law on abstraction licences, the Government might have to pay compensation to stop some of the more damaging abstractions, such as those that might damage wetlands and areas of outstanding natural beauty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The costs will be shared between various bodies, so it is difficult to give the hon. Gentleman a full picture. I suspect that, if the framework directive is successfully negotiated and adopted, it will take river basin management authorities time to find out what needs to be done in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, agriculture and industry, as well as consumers, rely on water. In the end, we will all have to pay if we want less-polluted, higher quality water and sustainable water use. The question of proportionality is part of the process in which we are engaged and we must ensure that we do not pay vast sums for little or no benefit. That is why cost-benefit and cost-compliance assessments are such important, integral parts of the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister expressed in her first memorandum some concerns about the requirement for full cost recovery in article 12 of the proposed framework directive. Obviously, there is scope to require householders to pay substantially increased charges for water as a result of a European directive. What has charging policy for water to do with water quality objectives? Is the Minister satisfied with article 12, or is she negotiating hard to have it amended?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating a water framework directive. The idea of a framework directive is that,
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
although parameters are set at European level, it is left to member states to determine how best to meet those agreed aims in line with their own systems. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do about our existing systems and the way in which Ofwat and the Government decide who is responsible for payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 12 has been negotiated so that it now contains a duty to take account of the principle to which the hon. Gentleman referred, rather than to ensure full cost recovery. That is yet another difficult crease that we have managed to iron out during our presidency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How do the directives sit alongside Agenda 2000 and the impact of agriculture on the environment, especially given the increased discharge of nitrates and phosphates into water catchments? I know of many local examples of serious pollution resulting from such discharge off the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, any move towards more sustainable and cleaner water sources and ecological health means that, so far as possible, such incidents must be avoided. Agriculture—the example that my hon. Friend used—industry and consumers must bear that in mind in the way that they use water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework directive contains a new approach to tackling pollution and, as I have have said, it goes further than the traditional emissions limits. The ecological health of surface water courses will be measured so that member states must identify and tackle any biological impact, including that caused by agricultural run-off. That will give a spur to using more sustainable agricultural processes as well as more sustainable industrial processes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has mentioned the need to balance prescription and flexibility in the directive. Which part of the directive does she identify as the Government's priority for securing flexibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The structure of the framework directive is inherently flexible simply because two of the principal factors in determing whether water is clean are ecological health and chemical quality. The new bodies that will be created, the river basin authorities, will work on the basis of what each member country decides is the best authority to look after the ground-waters, rivers and estuaries at a local level. It is a diffuse directive that contains much flexibility. Some issues such as the priority list of toxins will be monitored community-wide and there will be comparability across member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that it is the first time that a directive sets targets at community level but leaves much of the assessment, measurement and transparency to decisions at a local level. Over time, it will be flexible enough to allow scientific or technological advances to be taken into account wihout changing laws. If we manage to negotiate the framework directive successfully, it will stay up to date; it will not look as old and dated in 30 years' time as the 1970s legislation now does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobbin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby mentioned the history of land pollution. Will the Minister comment on the industrial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
pollution of rivers, which unfortunately still occurs? Will the directive have any influence on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directive is designed to ensure that any source of pollution, agricultural or industrial, must be detected and dealt with. It would be up to member states to decide how to do that, depending on the substances involved. As I said, there will be a priority list of the most hazardous chemicals, which will have to be strictly controlled. The river basin authority will trace any pollution problem back to its source and it will then be up to each member state, under the arrangements that it has implemented, to deal with the costs and the consequences of the incident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent incident in Spain, a signatory of the directive, is a good example of industrial pollution that will have to be dealt with by a member state. As an island, we do not have the cross-boundary problems suffered by some European countries, whereby pollution from a river, such as the Rhine or the Danube, in one country eventually causes damage downstream in another. There are some such problems in Ireland, but for us it is not an issue. The framework directive has to be drawn up to deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the Minister's earlier answers, it is clear that no major health problem in European countries is driving the directive. Is there evidence that water quality has deteriorated, in the UK or other EU countries, over the past five years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directive is not health-based, unlike the bathing water directive. That directive is based on the effects of water quality on the health of bathers. That is why designated bathing waters have to be used by a certain number of people every year to justify the costs of cleaning. This directive is about a sustainable environmental use of our water sources; it is not directly about health, although if we get it right, it is highly likely that water quality will be improved, although not in the focused, health-related way of the bathing water directive. The directive is concerned with ecological health and with preventing over-abstraction and the destruction of wetlands or areas of outstanding natural beauty from overuse of our water resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The bathing waters directive is being revised not because it is inadequate in terms of health protection but to introduce a more rounded and effective system of measurement. Will my hon. Friend say whether bathing waters in Europe have improved or deteriorated since that directive has been in place? If they are worse, a new, more effective system may be needed to improve bathing water quality in Europe in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend touches on some of the doubts that we have about the bathing water directive, but there is no doubt about the Government's support for achieving the highest possible standards in all the designated bathing waters in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are different ways of measuring compliance with the bathing water directive across Europe. The way in which samples are taken, stored and then measured can affect the results, but the directive says little about that. It simply refers to certain chemicals and suggests
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
that a good standard is achieved by not having too much concentration of such chemicals in the water and that samples will be taken every two months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Changes were proposed in the mid-1990s affecting some of the things that were measured and mandatory levels for beaches to conform to a good or acceptable standard were tightened up. We do not think that matters will be improved by those changes and it could involve spending large amounts of money for no obvious gain. Like the previous Government, we are opposed to the current proposals to amend the bathing water directive. We want the Commission to withdraw it and to consult member states to consider how it might be updated in a way that will bring benefits that can be measured, rather than the mechanistic way suggested in the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I return to the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire? The hon. Lady said that the framework directive was not about quality but ecology. I draw her attention to paragraph 29 of her most recent explanatory memorandum under the heading "Subsidiarity" in which she states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal sets broad objectives in line with the general aim of the Directive for a common level of ambition for the quality of Community waters."</p></blockquote>
If that is the objective, will the Minister address again the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire and say whether or not it is about quality? If it is about quality, should not it be for individual member states to decide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that it was not about quality; I sad that it was not directly related to health. The bathing water directive is to protect bathers by ensuring a certain quality of bathing water. The directive is about a whole range of issues, of which quality is one. Ecological health is another, as is avoiding poisions or toxins in the water. It covers a much broader range of issues. I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman thought that I was saying that the directive was not about quality, but the point that I was trying to make to the hon. Member for North Shropshire was that it is not directly related to incidents of ill health caused by contact with water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her recognition of the importance of the principle of proportionality. I am sure that the Committee will applaud her commitment to that principle. However, such matters will be decided by the Council of Ministers-14 other Ministers will be round the table—who must vote for measures that they know will have huge cost implications. Far be it from me to suggest that some countries will vote for the measure but may have not so much commitment to implementing it. Will the Minister tell the Committee what confidence she has that the measures will be implemented universally throughout the EU and say which bodies will be responsible for enforcement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right that, as always, there will be a qualified majority vote. As we have not yet negotiated final agreements on derogations or the time scale, it is impossible to form detailed views on the countries that may object or on how derogations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
and the timetables will be treated in the directive's final form. Clearly, if the directive were agreed and adopted, which we hope will happen, and the Commission felt that the framework directive was being flouted or ignored by member countries, it would have to take appropriate action, as normally happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not as pessimistic as the hon. Gentleman about the ability of member states to put the directive into effect. It will help to resolve some of the cross-boundary issues that affect the great rivers and watercourses in Europe, which cause difficulties within member states and between them. If we can get the balance and the proportionality right and ensure that the directive is properly agreed, it has a good chance because it is flexible and has subsidiarity at its heart. It will be a good piece of European legislation and, I suspect, much more effective than the legislation that it will repeal, which dates back to the 1970s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on from that, is the Government's position shared by a majority of other EU member states? If not, how can we persuade them to move towards our position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman referring to the framework directive or the bathing water directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The framework directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Negotiations on the directive have made progress much more quickly than anyone had imagined. They began under the Luxembourg presidency and were taken forward under our presidency. There is a commitment to try to reach a common position by June, if possible. The difficulty is that the directive involves a co-operation process and the European Parliament may not have reached its decision by June. The directive may be finally adopted—if negotiations continue to be as successful as they have been to date—after the end of the British presidency. The situation is not completely clear at the moment. However, there is a great willingness to complete the process, partly because people realise how inadequately the 1970s legislation deals with today's issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my previous question, will the Minister provide Committee members with a list of enforcement agencies throughout the EU? I appreciate that that is not the sort of information that she carries in her handbag, but I should be grateful if she could provide it subsequently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can do that, but if the directive comes into effect, member states will have to designate their own competent authorities to enforce it. The Environment Agency would be designated in this country, and equivalent designations would occur elsewhere. It will be up to member states to designate what they believe to be a competent authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has to be transparency, and the legislation makes provision for public consultation about decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill), will the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea of the framework directive is precisely to achieve such common standards in areas that the directive specifies.

	<p>11.28 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 7531/97, a draft Directive establishing a framework for Community action on water policy, and 12929/97, the Commission's proposed amendments to this draft Directive; and endorses the Government's proposed approach to negotiations on the proposal in the Council;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee also takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 6177/94, a draft Directive concerning the quality of bathing water, and 12591/97, an amended draft Directive on the quality of bathing water; and endorses the Government's approach to the proposal.</p></blockquote>
The Government consider the water framework directive to be an important piece of environmental legislation and a bold step forward in the way that the waters of the European Community are protected and managed. It will provide a genuine framework for action for all inland and coastal waters, including estuaries and ground waters, in the Community, replacing outdated legislation, embracing existing legislation wherever it still applies, and allowing for future changes when they become necessary because of advances in Science or technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive proposes a new approach to water quality and quantity, based around the principle of sustainability. Physical and chemical aspects of the water environment will be measured, but the principal indicator of good quality will be the health of the resident biological species. Such an approach has the great advantage that it will continue to be appropriate, even with the rapid pace of technological change, well into the next century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive is necessarily long and complex as a result of its ambition and innovative scope. Many important aspects remain to be negotiated. It will be essential to achieve the right balance between flexibility and prescription and to ensure that the time scales and derogations are pitched at realistic levels. The Government will strive to achieve that, and will seek the Committee's support in so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the revision of the bathing waters directive was first published in 1994, none of the EU presidencies has given it sufficient priority even to place it on the agenda of the European Council. The amended proposal would involve even greater difficulties of compliance for member states and considerably more expenditure, with little or no benefit in terms of improved public health. No member state consistently achieves 100 per cent. compliance even with the existing directive. The real need is to ensure that existing mandatory standards, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
well as the higher guideline standards that member states must endeavour to observe, are achieved more consistently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recent informal indications are that a clear majority of member states, including the United Kingdom, favour abandoning the Commission's amended proposal and considering a new approach to the revision that builds on experience of the existing directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Chope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the privilege of representing a constituency that is bounded by two major rivers, the Stour and the Avon. My constituency is part of a European constituency that is named after three rivers, the Itchen, the Test and the Avon. Obviously, therefore, I have a constituency interest in the matter, not least because we also have some fine beaches in Christchurch, some of which win blue flag awards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for showing the progress that has been made in negotiating some of the worst elements out of the framework directive. I admit to still being slightly perplexed about its purpose. In answer to the final question, the Minister said that it was intended to establish common standards across Europe. However, paragraph 29 of her explanatory memorandum explains that the directive is designed to achieve
	<br><blockquote><p>"a common level of ambition for the quality of Community waters."</p></blockquote>
It is much more difficult to measure levels of ambition than hard quality. Why we are dealing with levels of ambition rather than with common standards of quality?

As has been revealed by hon. Members' questions, we are also worried about the financial implications of the framework directive. I hope that the Minister can advise the Committee as soon as the compliance cost assessment is available so that hon. Members may ask questions about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have anxieties—shared by the previous Government—about the bathing water directive. Those anxieties are not peculiar to this country but are shared by most of the member states. Why, therefore, is the Commission so pig headed in pursuing a document that does not enjoy the support of any member state? In negotiation about the framework directive, which is an ambition of the Commission and is supported by many member states, can the Government insist that the Commission withdraw the ill-conceived bathing water directive, which is causing enormous anxiety?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are approaching the end of April 1998, a month in which the United Kingdom has apparently had record amounts of rainfall—the most rainfall in April this century, if not since records began. I understand that many of our reservoirs are full. One consequence of this abnormal amount of rainfall is that it is much more difficult for beaches close to river outlets to comply with the bathing water standards. The start date for the bathing season in this country is 15 May, and let us hope that the weather is suitable for widespread bathing from that date, but the information about the quality of bathing waters is collected a fortnight before that—in other words, starting this weekend. That is a mandatory requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
There is a concern that it will be difficult for authorities with beaches close to estuaries which have had that abnormal amount of rainfall during April to comply. The consequences is that there will be a scaremongering campaign saying that beach A or beach B has lost or will lose its blue flag status. The Minister will understand that in the competitive world of tourism many English seaside resorts are worried about the rigid application of the existing bathing water directive in assessing sea bathing water quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A derogation is available for other member states, and for this country, which allows measurements not to be taken during abnormal weather. We as a country seem to be more robust in minimising the number of exceptions under the abnormal weather waiver, whereas other countries, recognising that a month of record rainfall will have damaging short-term effects on the quality of bathing waters, will exclude measurements taken during that period and certainly after surges of rainwater through the river system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister could take this opportunity to allay concerns on that front. In this country, and particularly in the south of England, we take pride in the quality of our bathing water. We are worried that some continental resorts get away with lower standards, although the propaganda suggests that their quality is better than ours. It comes back to the issue of health, which was raised by one of my hon. Friends. The reality is that it is safe to bathe in the waters off the United Kingdom; it is not necessary for people to travel abroad to have good quality bathing water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members are pleased that the Government are making progress in negotiating a framework directive and delighted that they are sticking to the previous Government's opposition to changes in the bathing water directive. I hope that the Minister will be able to allay public concerns about bathing water, particularly in the light of an irresponsible report published earlier this week. That report raised public concern about something about which the public should not be concerned and failed to put the issue into its proper context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I want to concentrate on the bathing water directive, because, as I said earlier, I have a constituency interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report to which the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) just referred has had a serious effect in Blackpool and along the whole Fylde coast. Many Labour Members talked about the financial implications of both directives, so it is with some irony that I report that North West Water has spent millions and millions of pounds on initiatives along the Fylde coast to absolutely no effect. Therefore, we must look seriously at the way in which money is spent, where it is spent, why it is spent and at the end result. I have requested a meeting with representatives of North West Water to find out why things went wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
As I acknowledged earlier, I am no scientist, and lay people must rely on the evidence of those who set themselves up as experts and as knowledgeable in these areas. A Save our Bay campaigner told me that a couple of years ago, when North West Water gave a presentation in Fleetwood on its proposal, one scientist told her that the half-treated sewage would rise to the surface in Morecambe bay and that the efficacious rays of the sun would disinfect it. Another scientist told her that this same half-treated sludge would sink to the bottom of the Lune deep, disappear from sight, never raising its ugly head again, and that no more sewage would be cast up on the shoreline. If two scientists who are both advising North West Water come up with totally different advice, how on earth can we have confidence in them? I go home and read my history books instead of those documents. We must ask those who set themselves up as experts to be much firmer in the advice that they give, especially as the water companies spend large sums of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new water treatment plant in Fleetwood is causing the local community problems, not only because it is emitting noxious fumes but because it is not doing the job for which it was built. It has not affected the quality of the bathing water around Fleetwood. A local vet tells me that more and more pet owners are coming to see her because their pets are becoming ill after walking along the shoreline. There are clearly issues that need to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that North West Water is considering new proposals to treat sewage going into the rivers which will then be discharged into the Lune deep. At last it is considering ultra-violet treatment and appropriate tertiary treatment. North West Water's new approach seems to be linked to the proposals mentioned by the Minister earlier about river basin management. One thing that has been highlighted in recent years along the Fylde coast is that it is not enough to look only at the bathing water; we must look at the rivers that discharge into the sea and then look inland, as well as at the discharges direct into the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the directives will give more assurances to those who will bathe in the seas off Blackpool. We must remember that 13 million people visit Blackpool, many of them only to go on the big one and the pleasure beach, but many families want to enjoy pleasant summer days on the beach, bathing in the water. We must reassure them that they can do so in safety and that they and their children will not become ill. Therefore, we must ensure that investments are efficacious and that regulations and directives are appropriate, realistic and achievable and can guarantee the health of those who bathe off our coastline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have been impressed by the number of questions asked about the cost of compliance with the directive and others, showing the importance that the Committee attaches to standards, and not least to setting the standard at the correct level. I want to pursue that matter by talking about costs in relation to benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
One benefit is the purity of the water that we drink. I believe that British water has been safe to drink for a long time. This country has a long and proud tradition of supplying safe water to its population, originally through the undertakings set up by municipal authorities and more lately through the water authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I perhaps betray my age when I say that I have never drunk the water east of Dover because I believed that our water was better and safer than any water that could be obtained elsewhere. I am prepared to concede that standards have improved in other countries, and that in many countries they have improved immeasurably. However, this country is in danger of selling itself a little short if we take the view that much work needs to be done on the quality of British water. I contend that we have enjoyed good water for a long time and we should not be prepared to concede that fact to anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concentration of effort and debate on water quality has resulted in the manufacturers of mineral water enjoying a bonanza. Today, many of us prefer to drink water out of a bottle rather than from the tap. However, 20 years ago, it would have never occurred to me to drink water other than that that came out of our taps. Good as our water was 20 years ago, it has probably improved since then. However, discussions on the safety and quality of water have created a bonanza for the producers of mineral water, who have benefited commercially at the expense of the statutory water undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Politicians—especially the Minister, who is a representative of Government—would be at fault if water was not provided in sufficient quantities for all its uses by people and industry in this country. Although concentration is currently on the safety aspects of waters, we should not lose sight of the fact that the availability of water is more important than its absolute purity. The product is essential. I have thought for a long time that the time will surely come when we will have to establish a national grid to pipe water from those areas of the country, such as Scotland, where there is a superfluity of water to those parts where there are increasing shortages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk will accept that East Anglia may not have enough water for all the needs that are likely to arise in the decades to come. If we can pipe other essential ingredients, such as gas and petroleum, of a modem society from one end of the country to another, serious consideration will have to be given to piping that most essential product—water—from one end of the country to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The river Severn, which is the longest river in the British Isles, runs through my constituency. Many years ago, before we were scared of the possible terrible consequences, I swam in the river Severn. The water I drink in Bridgnorth comes directly from the river and worse things than people swimming in it have happened to it. It comes to us not just second or third hand. It is recycled many times after all the towns and cities upstream of Bridgnorth have done with it what they will. I shall not elaborate on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great anxiety in Shropshire about groundwater levels and I am sure that the Minister is aware of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
the unease all over the country about rates of abstraction. It is inevitable that the time will come when we have to consider transferring massive quantities of water through pipelines from areas with high rainfall and a surplus of water to those with low rainfall and a deficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall keep my comments brief. I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister that the directive is a bold step forward. It brings together and updates many other proposals dating back to the mid-70s. That is welcome and necessary, as the rate at which the world changes has increased greatly in the past 20 or 30 years. The framework document has sustainability at its core, as it must if it is to keep up with the demands of developing countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been in vogue among hon. Members this morning to declare an interest before speaking. When I asked earlier about global warming and climatic change I wondered whether to declare an interest on behalf of the whole human race. However, I certainly have an interest in the question of protected areas. I am fortunate that my Gillingham constituency has, in the north Kent marshes and the River Medway estuary, a site of special scientific interest. In the past that area suffered heavy pollution from HM Chatham dockyard, but the yard has gone long since, and the problem is easing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area is also an internationally important site under the Ramsar convention. The problem for us, when we make decisions affecting the ecological balance of an area, is that we must live for the day, whereas the impact may not be known for a million years. So I am pleased that article 6 of the framework directive contains a requirement that a review of the environmental impact of human activity be completed by the end of 2001 and updated every six years thereafter. Also, I am pleased that articles 9 and 11 deal with registering protected areas and with establishing programmes to monitor the ecological status in each river basin district. Those important matters have longterm implications for future generations, both in Europe and further afield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is not confined to Europe; it affects the world. Last week, I was lucky enough to be part of a British parliamentary delegation to Japan. I hope that the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) will be reassured when I tell him that I drank the water east of Dover and survived. In the first symposium of its kind, the British delegation discussed economic and social issues with our counterparts in the Japanese Diet. Although Japan recognises that there are many things that it can do in terms of deregulation, several Members of its Parliament pointed out the difference between economic and social regulations. They recognised the need for social and environmental regulations in terms of housing and jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed water framework directive is a bold step forward. Clearly, it will be able to cope with a continuing development within Europe, and can help to set examples for other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We talk about water against the background of one of the previous Government's great successes. When I was at school, I remember reading gloomy articles about the pathetic state of our sewers and the awful quality of our water. The Minister will be aware that in those days there were no sewage plants in Liverpool-6,000 tonnes of solids, as they were politely called, went into the Mersey untreated. Someone once left a naphtha cock open at the Stanlow refinery, and on that occasion the Mersey had the distinction of being referred to as a fire hazard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thanks to the spectacular success of privatisation, those days have now gone, and we have a very healthy water industry. I see that Labour Members are sniggering. Shropshire, where I come from, is landlocked, and most of its water is abstracted. Water quality is therefore a matter of great concern. When I visited Severn Trent Water's Mile End plant, the people there were immensely proud of what they have achieved in almost 10 years since privatisation. They would bitterly resent the sort of reaction that we have just seen from Labour Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Humble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that in 1993 the European Court of Justice ruled against the previous Government for failing to bring the quality of the bathing water off the Blackpool and Southport coast up to the required standard. As I mentioned earlier, the privatised North West Water has also failed to do that. There has not been good news across the whole country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for that helpful intervention, with which I agree entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the great advantage of today's system is that it is transparent. Before privatisation, the water authority for the north-west was both poacher and gamekeeper: it got away with murder. Nowadays, Ofwat acts as a policeman and watches over the private water companies. Because of that, the hon. Lady has access to excellent information, and she can criticise North West Water on a sound basis. We have progressed a long way from the days when 6,000 tonnes of untreated sewage could be pumped into the Mersey—although I am sure that that did tremendous things for Morecambe bay's prawn population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow, only 5 per cent. of the water that lands on this country is collected. A more efficient system is needed for that, and more competition would supply it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people in the water industry to whom I have spoken are not frightened of the proposed changes, and indeed welcome them in some respects. As the Minister has said, the new proposals tidy up those of the old directive. That dates back to the 1970s, and is completely out of date. It does not take account of the latest scientific advice on health that has been approved by the World Health Organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us if the issue of lead pipes is relevant? The campaign about lead appears to be slightly hysterical. I am not a scientist, but I understand that lead causes a marginal reduction in IQ—so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
marginal that it is hard to detect. Lead pipes are more common in this country than they are on the continent. A lead pipe replacement programme would cost between £1 billion and £5 billion. That would be an horrendous imposition on the water industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should recognise the extra environmental costs that have been imposed on the water companies. Water is the most unpopular privatisation because it is the only one that has led to increased charges. Will the Minister consider having environmental costs itemised on water bills? That would stop an industry that has done so much good being a public joke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I approve of the directive, even though I do not understand why regulations should come from Brussels: we could develop standards here. However, I take issue with the bathing water directive. How can Europe-wide standards be imposed when geography creates such huge differences between arid Spain and the wetlands of Scotland and Ireland, in which the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) has an interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters should be decided locally. Shropshire is landlocked, but in summer many of my constituents—even my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow—go to Aberdovey on the Welsh coast. I have discussed the directive with Welsh Water, which believes that the guideline standards are 20 times as stringent as the mandatory standards. However, it will abide by the European standards and its aims to achieve 50 blue flags.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It will cost Welsh Water £30 million to £40 million to bring every Welsh beach frequented by swimmers up to the required standard by 2000. Welsh Water has attacked that challenging task with gusto. They have the co-operation of local authorities, the CBI and the Wales tourist board. They also have strong support from Surfers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In response to remarks made by the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble), an enormous investment has been made in a beach in South Wales called Cefn Sidan. However, the beach consistently failed to attain a blue flag. Sheep were driven on to the foreshore on a couple of occasions, thus lowering standards of cleanliness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I question the value of a Euro-standard. The Welsh know that Cefn Sidan is, in general, extremely clean. In Italy, a beach that has been flooded will not be tested for two days so that it can return to its usual state. There is a danger of imposing colossal costs on British authorities which bring beaches up to standard. I doubt whether we will see similar tests in Europe, especially in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Mediterranean. I have anecdotal evidence against Greece, for example, which contradicts the favourable results in the official document.

My constituency has no rivers, but I think it has some small brooks. It has no beer manufacturing industry either, although it has many beer drinkers. Water, as a subject, is therefore not particularly important to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister explained the situation clearly and quickly, and I was impressed by her admission that certain matters have not yet been discussed. Yet while listening to the Minister I watched Opposition Members. That is always good fun. During our Committee's dicussions on matters as various as bananas, water treatment plants and God knows what else, the comments of Opposition Members have always proved interesting. They begin demurely by asking a number of general questions. More often than not, the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk asks questions about finance. With great repetitiousness, Conservative Members ask similar questions, because they cannot think of new ones. General questions are followed by more specific ones on cost-benefit resources. Then, regardless of the subject under discussion, Conservative Members go Euro-bashing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have apologised to the hon. Member for North Shropshire. When he referred to 50 blue flags in Wales, I though that he meant Conservative Members of Parliament—and that would have been impossible, because Wales does not have any. Of course, the hon. Gentleman was in fact talking about water quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ludlow said that he had not drunk any water east of Dover. That is a typical little Englander mentality. However, I sat next to the hon.

I was born in the Netherlands, and I therefore know that a whole host of European Union nations have high standards in health, the environment and other matters. Time and again Conservative Members claim that Britain is wonderful, and that it has the highest standards, while countries east of Dover muck it up in some way or other. That is not the case. Does the Minister broadly agree with me, or with those who hammer other European Union countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Maclean 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Penrith and The Border)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a couple of points. I urge the Government to grasp the nettle and establish definitive standards in bathing water quality that the public can understand. The blue flag schemes were the bane of my life six years ago, when I was the Minister responsible for such matters. Two other so-called independent groups then researched water quality or bathing water standards too, and published clean beach awards, so Britain used to be crucified on three separate occasions—sometimes unfairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an awful lot of confusion then, and there still is. In some such cases we lose out because of debris and detritus washed ashore on our beaches. I cannot remember which of the various awards it is that takes into account the amount of debris from passing ships. We are one of the biggest victims in Europe because of the huge amount of traffic not just off the south coast, going through the channel—which of course affects other European countries—but around all our coasts, in the Irish sea and the North sea, and because of the tidal systems—I refer especially to our west coast beaches north of Blackpool, North and Fleetwood, on the west coast of Cumbria. No matter how much North West Water may invest to get rid of coliforms and other nasty bugs from the sewage discharged into the sea, we are still stuffed, in clean beach awards, because of detritus and rubbish washed ashore from passing ships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may need to take tougher action about some of the rubbish found on beaches which can be clearly identified as having come from certain ships. I go occasionally to the beach at Silloth in Cumbria, and it is extraordinary how much material one can pick up that has clearly been thrown off passing ships—some of it knocked off in storms, but an awful lot just dumped—that can be clearly traced to the ships concerned. If we are to achieve a reputation for clean beaches, we may have to take action on that matter and bring more and tougher prosecutions against those who dump overboard from ships the rubbish that is washed up on our beaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow is right—one of our beaches at Silloth on the west coast in Cumbria suffered because of the problem of unfenced areas to which ponies and sheep came to graze occasionally, contributing to the organic matter on the beach. Provided that that is kept within reasonable proportions, the beach remains perfectly safe. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
public are not going to avoid a beach because the odd donkey has been running along it and left a deposit. If Blackpool is to regain its reputation, it may have to ban all the donkeys from the beach because they are polluting it. That is the sort of nonsense that will result if we take things too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that such considerations form part of the blue flag award system, but if I had been in the Department of the Environment longer, I might have been able to grasp the nettle of conflicting quality awards for our beaches. Just when we managed to get an award for quality based on low coliform levels, we would get stuffed by another review of our water from some private enterprise award-giving body that concluded that something else was wrong with our beaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to be very cautious of the framework directive. There may be some groundbreaking and potentially good stuff in it, but there is a tremendous danger that the management of water resources will get sucked into it. The management of water resources in Spain and Portugal—and even in Holland—will be radically different from what we need. I am not making a "little Englander" point when I say that the management of water resources is best left to the countries concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the problem with the bathing water directive is that Britain signed up to it naively in the late 1970s or early 1980s, thinking that it was a jolly good thing to improve bathing water standards. Improving bathing water standards was crucial to countries bordering the Mediterranean, which was turning into the world's biggest sewage pit, with millions of people bathing in it. Because of our climate, Britain does not have quite so many people bathing off our coasts, and we did not think that there would be a tremendous problem. Of course, we have some important sea resorts and we must improve their standards, but we fell into the trap of accepting standards that may have been desirable for the Mediterranean but were unnecessary for this country. We face the same danger with the framework directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree profoundly with my hon. Friend about the desirability of moving water round the country. There may be merit in some schemes, whereby it would be possible to take some water from Kielder, move it into the Tyne and, through short canal systems, push it into other rivers. The movement of water along canals against its will, as it were, may be possible in the future, but the sheer cost of trying to pump it round the country is astronomical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point, which I may have not made clearly enough to the Committee, was that we are talking about huge costs to improve the purity of water. Should not we be considering whether that money would be better spent ensuring that there is 100 per cent. availability for the foreseeable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Britain is awash with water, but we are not good at keeping it in the places where it is required. Plenty of water falls on this country and we must improve the means of its capture in areas of potential shortages, such as in the south-west, in East Anglia and in some conurbations.

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
The easiest and best way to deal with the problem is with reservoirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be content if new Labour could grasp the nettle and persuade people of the need for more reservoirs. By that, I do not mean old-fashioned big ugly square holes in the ground, but a few more Kielder-type reservoirs in the south of England. With all the environmental, leisure and tourism benefits that those would bring, they could resolve the problem for the foreseeable future. I accept, however, that people do not want to see their favourite little English village going under 100 ft of water. There are enormous difficulties in building reservoirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister reads the old report entitled "Using Water Wisely", which no doubt will be updated as I published it six or seven years ago, she will see that we investigated methods to save water. The annual increase in the rate of water consumption is about 1 per cent. per annum; it is accounted for mainly by dishwashers and other domestic appliances, and our general desire to use more water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Measures can be taken to conserve water, not just by repairing leaking pipes. A certain point is reached at which it becomes uneconomical to chase leaking pipes down to a low level of leakages. Other methods could be undertaken, such as the use of toilet and bathroom facilities that consume less water, pricing mechanisms and metering—although the latter may not be acceptable to the Government. Other measures could also ensure that more water is retained in the areas where it is required. I warn against the suggestion by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow that we pump water round the country. That would require hundreds of massive Rolls-Royce engines and pumping stations every few miles, and a huge amount of electricity would be consumed just to move the water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some interesting work could be carried out by tipping water a few miles away into other river basins and catchment areas, and moving it along canals. Generally, canals lie still, but if enough water is poured into them at one end and given a little shove, a small wave of water can move through the canal system. Such work is fascinating, but it could be expensive. The movement of some water between river basins is possible, but we must not believe that we can connect a national water grid throughout Britain and have the surplus water, from not even as far as Scotland, but from Kielder, supplied to East Anglia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been citing examples of the dangers of trying to move water round England and solve East Anglia's problem by using the surplus in Kielder. Now I refer to the danger in Europe. Just as there are 10 different solutions for water supply in England, no doubt there will be 100 different solutions for water supply in Europe. Pumping water round Spain may not be acceptable, but pumping may be the best possible solution in Bavaria—I know not how.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger of including water resource management in a framework directive—it is not going to happen now, but I know the propensity of the European Community to come up with all-encompassing framework directives, which include absolutely
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
everything—is that a European-wide solution would unfairly impose costs and extraction charges on countries that did not need them because they could solve the problem by other means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wholeheartedly agree with the central drift of my right hon. Friend's argument. I would like him to acknowledge, however, that Shropshire—where my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow and I come from—has a real problem, with farmland being damaged by excessive abstraction. I have seen farm bungalows that have virtually collapsed and fields that could not be rolled or harrowed because they had become so undulating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had interesting dicussions with Severn Trent Water and Welsh Water about the possibility of moving water relatively cheaply in large volume through the river and canal system to the midlands. It is feasible. I would like the Minister to know that excessive abstraction can damage farmland quite severely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. That sort of short distance movement of water in river basins and between canals and rivers is feasible and not too expensive. One should not comment on the nods and winks that one sees elsewhere in the Committee Room, Mr. Maxton, but I think that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions may also conclude that that is sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Excessive abstraction is damaging, but farmers themselves can do more to create reservoirs. The Minister has a tremendous card to play, which would enhance British wildlife and biodiversity in the countryside. She should encourage farmers to build more reservoirs for their own use—to grow potatoes in East Anglia and so on. That would also benefit wildlife and the countryside, because farmers would extract less water from the rivers. The reservoirs would fill up in winter time, when more than enough water usually lands on this country. Holding it and retaining it is our problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Best 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members too often believe their own propaganda, and think that the privatisation of water was a good thing. Those living in Yorkshire recently experienced difficulties, and have a slightly different view of privatised water undertakings. We saw for ourselves the experimentation and the mass transportation of water that Opposition Members have referred to. Fleets of tankers travelled around Yorkshire carrying fresh water to much needed storage facilities. Our experience of privatisation has not been good. We even had the chairman and publicity manager of Yorkshire Water advising people to share a bath—but not too often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The world has changed since the hon. Member for Ludlow used to swim freely in the River Severn. The water authorities of those days were public undertakings, and they did a remarkably fine job. I remember that, as secretary of a trade union branch in the early 1960s, I organised a visit to the local sewage works. At the end of the trip, the works manager took a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
cupful of water from the end of the system and drank it, such was his confidence in the efficacious nature of the works. We were also told that when the water entered the sea, natural biological systems would take care of any problems that still existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since those days, we have seen the introduction of various chemicals, which would make the drinking of processed water hazardous. Industrial processes have also intervened, and the biological threats of the past have been joined by chemical threats. We must take that into account. Those who have experienced the joy of visiting the north-west of Scotland will have seen the kind of sea-borne damage referred to earlier, which we must also take into account. I hesitate to mention some of the things I have seen on beautiful beaches, washed ashore from passing ships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are benefits to living in a place like Yorkshire. We have wonderful catchment areas, where water is normally available. I agree with those who have said that transportation on a mass scale—national grids for water systems—is not viable and may be extremely damaging to the environment. Defending our groundwater would be a more realistic proposition. The removal of water for brewers and others from artesian wells is a long-established practice and has various benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as a society, we have not been very successful in collecting the water that falls on our roofs. In my area, water from thousands of acres of roofing runs into collection points and then straight into the river—or beck, as we say in Yorkshire. There is a powerful case for insisting on soakaway systems. Incorporating such systems into every substantial housing development or industrial site, with their vast acreages of roofing, would enrich the local groundwater supply and bring life back to many becks, streams and brooks that have in places almost run dry, including those that run through our inner-city areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would welcome observation by those responsible for managing our water industry that would encourage soakaway systems. Regrettably, we have lost one such system in my constituency. Anyone who knows anything about fresh water supplies knows that crayfish, which occur naturally in our becks, are the most sensitive of creatures and are the first to disappear if there is any pollution. They have been disappearing from our becks because of the want of fresh water, which normally arrives at the site of the beck, stream or brook through natural soakaway from the land. We should do something about that and I hope that the Minister will confirm that we should ensure that we make natural, proper use of our water supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am one of those people who thinks that the days of problems with the water supply east of Dover—if they ever existed—are over. I am not a great traveller, but I have never had any difficulty in drinking the water from any European country that I have visited. Indeed, drinking it has been a pleasure. Whatever they do to the water east of Dover somehow has a magical effect on the coffee and makes it taste better—an experience that I do not have in this country, although it may be something to do with the pleasurable atmosphere in which one drinks coffee abroad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.27 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and wide-ranging debate that has touched on many issues, connected to the two directives and ranging wider. The fact that the debate has ranged from large infrastructure projects and ring mains to the health of crayfish in the brooks of Yorkshire—all relevant issues—demonstrates the universality of concern about water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall respond to the many questions that I have been asked by hopping between the two directives, but I shall try to make it clear which one I am talking about. I hope that members of the Committee will understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch was worried about the difference between the phrases "common standards" and "common level of ambition" used in one of the explanatory memorandums submitted to the Committee. Those phrases are not contradictory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Common standards for the most dangerous substances—those on the priority list, to which I referred—will be established under the framework directive. Common European standards for the most dangerous substances—we envisage that only a few such substances will be involved—are designed to deal with areas, such as rivers or river basins, where trans-boundary pollution might occur. For example, pollution might flow down the Danube or the Rhine and affect many areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "common level of ambition", which is somewhat unusual in legislation, reflects the ambitious nature of the new framework directive. The aim of the framework directive, if successfully agreed and put into operation, will be to achieve good water status in river basin management areas. That good status will depend on a combination of chemical and ecological good health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of a common level of ambition demonstrates that this is not a prescriptive, centralising directive—unlike the bathing water directive, which contains mandatory targets for several main substances. The phrase demonstrates that member states must use their own monitoring and assessment systems to achieve good status in their water. Therefore, the common level of ambition is to achieve the aim of the directive—good status—but there will be common European standards for various very toxic substances, which are likely to be pesticides, such as organophosphates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those phrases go together; they capture the unusual nature of the directive. Although it sets mandatory standards for a few substances on the priority list, about which trans-boundary issues might arise, it genuinely devolves power and responsibility to member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not sure, from what the hon. Member for Christchurch said, whether he wanted the existing bathing water directive to be completely withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not the existing one, but the new one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is reassuring, because the Goverment are committed to ensuring that the maximum possible number of our designated bathing water beaches are of the highest quality. This year we achieved 88 per cent.—an improvement, but we are working to increase the percentage further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
As I have said consistently during the debate, I agree that the previous Government and this Government have had problems with the revisions to the bathing water directive that the Commission and the European Parliament proposed in 1994 and 1997. We believe that imposing even tighter mandatory standards on such issues as enteroviruses would not improve water quality; it would mean spending more and more money just to chase our tails and would be out of all proportion. In other words, it would fail a cost-benefit analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe—all the signs are that most other member states agree—that the revisions that the Commission and the European Parliament proposed in 1997 are wholly unacceptable. Indeed, they make some of the problems that we had with the Commission's proposals of 1994 even worse. We shall ask the Commission to withdraw its proposals so that we can reconsider how we might update the bathing water directive to deal with some of the problems referred to both by Opposition Members and by my colleagues, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing bathing water directive is old—it was adopted in 1975, I believe—and is very much in the pattern of European legislation of that time; it is prescriptive and contains mandatory targets and a list of chemicals that must be measured at certain times. The hon. Gentleman made relevant points about a beach failing if there is a sudden flood or lots of rainwater, causing sewage outflows and so on, with many things being flushed through the sewers which would not normally be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are important issues. We want an updated directive, but not the one that is being proposed. I hope that the Commission will accept the reality that no member state has been willing to take the revisions forward in their present form. The Commission should withdraw its proposals, so that we can have a consultation process about how to update the bathing water directive to deal with some of the problems that members of the Committee have raised today. The Government agree that the bathing water directive should be revised to cover some of those issues. However, the directive has highlighted some of the problems that we face. The hon. Member for North Shropshire said that improvements were due to privatisation, but I suspect that they have more to do with some of the quality legislation that the EU has promulgated over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood is obviously extremely concerned about the Fylde coast. She is right to say that North West Water and the Environment Agency have been working closely together to make improvements in quality in time for the holiday season. Another £100 million will be spent by the water company to improve the treatment of sewage before it is discharged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure concerns more than bathing water quality. It deals with some of the issues related to urban waste water treatment. There is already EU legislation that by the end of this year will ban the dumping of sewage into the sea, and that has resulted in much more
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
investment in treating sewage and in updating the infrastructure, some of which is Victorian. The Marine Conservation Society, which was mentioned by several members of the Committee, recently published a very unhelpful report on the health of bathing waters. It used criteria that are much more stringent and not remotely like those in the bathing water directive. The report covers more beaches than the directive, which applies only to designated bathing waters. For the reasons given by hon. Members, it is unhelpful to have scaremongering reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that £2 billion has been spent by water authorities in increasing the quality of bathing and drinking water. Under the forthcoming urban waste water treatment directive, a further £8 billion will be spent on improving infrastructures. I think that we are doing enough to ensure good quality water. The Government are committed to the idea of the north Fylde coast doing better than it is now. The source of some of the problems has been identified, which means that North West Water knows that it must improve sewage outfalls. It has discovered other underlying problems in its attempts to find out why it has been doing so badly, and plans are in place to deal with those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a benefit to be gained from directives—it is just a question of how much. Without the bathing water directive, perhaps we would not have known how bad the Fylde coast was. We look forward to a quick improvement following investment by the water company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch was worried about the definition of abnormal weather conditions, and whether some bathing waters would pass and get their blue flags. The Commission realises that a flexible interpretation of derogations from the directive has emerged, and it is currently talking to member states. It sees the abnormal weather condition derogation being applied in a "robust manner"—I think that was the phrase used. Inconsistencies of application in different countries have been noted and the Commission is taking that up with those countries. I hope that that shows the need for greater consitency and comparability across Europe in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister elaborate on the time scale for changes in that regard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Discussions are going on between the Commission and member states. As soon as there is anything to report, I shall ensure that it is reported to the Committee. Currently, however, discussions are at an informal level. If member states continue to ignore the Commission's interpretation of the derogation, it could take them to court for failing to put the directive into force. The Commission is currently exerting behind-the-scenes pressure on member states, but if there are any new pronouncements I shall let the Committee know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ludlow made some interesting points, but it is wise to remember that water is a reusable resource, and that we have to ensure its availability and quality. Once again, I have to agree with the hon. Member for Christchurch, who said that although a water ring main is an attractive proposal, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
associated expense is colossal. There are other ways to deal with water management problems besides putting in place such an infrastructure. Moreover, we are not convinced that the power that it would take to pump water round the country is justified on sustainability grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, we can influence water use in other ways, including the encouragement of increased water efficiency in white goods and other consumer durables. We could also save substantial amounts of water that are currently lost, by changing water byelaws about the flushing mechanisms in toilets, for example—perhaps with greater use of the infamous hippo. One third of all domestic water is flushed down the toilet, and if we could deal with some of that waste, we would relieve pressure in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Clark) made about sustainability and water. The water framework directive makes that connection, and it refers to biological health and biodiversity, which relate to issues involving natural beauty and the need to preserve wildlife habitats—by preventing over-abstraction for example. The framework directive leaves member states to deal with those matters in their own way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to cross swords with the hon. Member for North Shropshire over privatisation. It is important to get water policy right rather than to rehearse old arguments. Given that the water industry is in the private sector, very robust regulation is clearly important, because of the monopoly status and because of the importance of water to human life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The water summit that the Government held shortly after we took office dealt with some of those matters. It also discussed water leakage, which the hon. Member for Ludlow mentioned. Leakage is an issue of water efficiency. We should not build a huge reservoir if there is 30 per cent. leakage in a water authority's pipe system. We should consider those and related issues before spending vast amounts on infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Shropshire said that replacing lead pipes would, it is estimated, cost between £1 billion and £5 billion. That matter relates directly to the drinking water directive, about which we intend to bring forward proposals soon. The hon. Gentleman was rather optimistic about the effects of lead on heatlh, and rather dismissive of its effects; we know quite a lot about how lead affects people's health. He was also rather pessimistic about the costs of replacing lead piping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interesting work, which has been demonstrated to me, has been done by various companies. Pipes do not have to be replaced; they can be shot through with plastic or another substance and insulated on the inside, to prevent lead from coming into contact with water. We should consider such ingenious solutions before simply digging up and replacing all the pipes. Obviously, one would dig them up when they reached the end of their useful lives and replace them with better materials. Nevertheless, materials being developed to protect against the dangers of lead are cheaper than the hon. Gentleman suggests, thanks to the ingenuity of British inventors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis) made an amusing point, about which I cannot comment, as this is my first visit to the Committee and I had not gathered that such a pattern exists—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contribution made by the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green was on form and typical-100 per cent. fact-free. According to the Library research paper, which quotes the Commission's 1994 study of the quality of bathing water, the Netherlands came out worst for "Waters insufficiently sampled", with a massive 36.5 per cent., followed by Italy with 8.5 per cent,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least the Netherlands admitted that it had not sampled the water. It being my first visit to the Committee, it had not occurred to me that such a pattern might exist, but judging by the laughs of recognition from Labour Members, it seems an accurate assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made enormous progress with the framework directive negotiations in a short space of time because of the more positive engagement in things European for which this Government have been responsible. We have been able to use the good will that we have garnered to make faster progress on the directive to remove those parts that would most worry hon. Members, such as the issue of territorial and marine waters. Another example is water management, about which people seem still to be worried, but for which there is no cause to worry given the current state of the negotiations. A more positive engagement in Europe has paid big dividends in many negotiations taking place during our presidency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a former Environment Minister, the hon. Member for Christchurch gave a learned speech, full of his experiences in office. He need not worry too much about sewage sludge affecting bathing water quality. A ban on dumping sewage at sea takes effect from the end of this year. We must therefore find other uses for it, which will also cause controversy. However, the infrastructure work to effect that ban is well advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is also unduly worried about the framework directive. There is no prospect of its becoming a water management issue, or of costs arising from it, unless decided at member state level. Member states must designate competent authorities and decide how to manage river basin authorities. To do that to most effect, they must consider conditions in their own countries. We are confident that if we manage successfully to attain a common position, it will be a framework with principles and aims, but the vast majority of the detailed work and associated administration will be done and decided on at member state level, as a genuine framework directive should work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West (Mr. Best) was right to say that chemical threats need to be taken seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the water summit, we are conducting a review into water abstraction. However, we face difficulties in the inherited legal situation of water abstraction as rights have been granted in perpetuity. Without paying unspecified compensation, it is difficult
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
to change that. Nevertheless, we are examining what can be done to limit the number of damaging abstractions that are currently taking place affecting farmland or areas of outstanding natural beauty. The results of that review will be available when it is concluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, on the proposed revision of the bathing water directive, we considered carefully our priorities for the presidency of the EU, and this was not one of them. It has proved to be so controversial over the years with all member states that there was practically no chance of achieving an agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may not have been one of the priorities to implement it, but it was surely one of the priorities to have the Commission withdraw it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is depressing that, despite the authority that goes to the presidency, the Government do not seem to have succeeded in persuading the Commission to withdraw it. Does the Minister think the Government will succeed in doing that before the end of their presidency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My instinct is that sooner or later the Commission will withdraw the proposal, simply because it cannot persuade anyone to put it on the agenda. The troika of countries that will have the next three presidencies similarly have no plans to proceed with the 1994 changes or the recommendations made by the Parliament in 1997. We have suggested strongly to the Commission that the time is ripe for them to realise that. As it will make no more progress with the revision of the directive in its current form, it should withdraw it so that we can consider how the bathing water directive might be better amended to make it a more easily usable and less arbitrary piece of European legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the principles upon which the water framework directive is being taken forward will be the way in which such legislation will go in the future. The directive is a new way of looking at these matters. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
bathing water directive again dates from the mid-1970s and looks increasingly out of date. The Government are still committed to meeting their legal obligations under existing legislation, but we think that there is a good case for having a completely different look at the way in which the bathing water directive might be amended in future. We hope that the Commission will soon learn that that is its best way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The water framework directive will be an important piece of European environmental legislation. The framework approach is welcome and should ensure lasting protection for the water environment that reflects advances in scientific and technical knowledge and focuses on sustainability. In essence, it will provide a framework which updates itself over time, because of its inherent flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that there is sufficient comparability between member states so that we can be confident that we are all working towards the same goals, at the same speed. But we will also seek to ensure that there is the flexibility to implement the directive in the most appropriate way at member state level. The Government will consider the results of the costs and benefits study carefully and will seek to ensure that the objectives, time scales and derogations are pitched at the right level to get the cross-benefit balance correct. It is an ambitious proposal and much progress has already been made in negotiations, but there is still some way to go. I am confident that we can play our part in taking this important directive to a satisfactory conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
