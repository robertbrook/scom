	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to see you in the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. My voice is not too good this morning, but I shall be as clear as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matters that we are considering this morning are complicated. We must, therefore, focus on the main issue: the financial system of the common agricultural policy that pays substantial sums to the agricultural industry. I have issued two explanatory memorandums on this issue, and the Select Committee on European Legislation has examined it in two reports. No one can deny that it is a matter of political importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for agrimonetary arrangements have important implications for participating and non-participating countries. The United Kingdom is, of course, one of the four non-participating countries. It is important for producers, consumers, traders and taxpayers that we get the right balance of measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the Select Committee on European Legislation, dated 28 October 1998, notes that the basic changes proposed are, in principle, straightforward and commonsensical, but that they have implications for the operation of the common agricultural policy that need to be understood and addressed. To do that, the Government have consulted widely with interested organisations, and have examined the budgetary consequences of the arrangements and the practicalities of implementing them. Many of the issues raised by our examination relate to complicated and detailed problems: that is evident in the summary of industry consultations that formed part of the appendix to the explanatory memorandum of 12 October. We can discuss those problems in greater detail during our debate. At this point, however, I shall touch on the broad areas of concern identified by the Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of these is the use of the daily market rate. That has evident value in achieving the UK's long-term aim of moving away from the highly artificial market support systems that have prevailed so far under the common agricultural policy. However, we recognise that that involves significant adjustments for business, and we have focused on ensuring that any technical and administrative problems have been adequately addressed. We have secured a declaration from the Commission that it will examine problems with operative events—I will be happy to define that term later—for determining rates on a sector-by-sector
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
basis. That will help to give traders the greater certainty that was previously provided by the option to pre-fix.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also considering the consequences for annual direct payments if the exchange rate on the operative date is particularly atypical. Nevertheless, our overall aim is to be realistic and to have a system that is simple to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of compensation, our priority has been to ensure that United Kingdom farmers do not face the full consequences of the loss of green rate protection on 1 January 1999—the birth date of the euro. Given the imbalances created by the current agrimonetary system, farmers would have faced an 11 per cent. to 15 per cent. cut in payments. That alone is an indication of the massively distorting effect of green rates. However, in the long term, compensation would undermine the whole move towards closeness to the market. We must get to the point where any compensation is seen as a safety net, rather than as an automatic response to normal market fluctuations. That is an important point for the Committee to consider during its deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, with regard to payments in euros, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food last week announced his intention to offer payments in euros for market-support measures from autumn 2000—I cannot be more precise about the date at present—and we shall examine further what could be done on direct payments. To make the option worth offering at all, the UK had to secure a change in the Commission's original restrictive proposal. The Commission has now changed its draft to minimise discrimination against euro payments in the four non-participating countries. We are now looking at the details of a system that confers the benefit of euro payments while avoiding the risks of speculation. We know what would happen if there was a possibility of speculation, and we want to avoid that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inevitable that the existing agrimonetary system should be adjusted in response to the single currency; the CAP is a huge part of the European Union's budget. The proposals for making the change are taking shape in a way that seems to respond to the UK's main concern. They have the potential to minimise discrimination between the countries that are "ins" and the "pre-ins", to keep costs down, to reduce trade distortions and to increase market transparency, which the Government are keen to do. The proposals would also give the EU an agrimonetary policy that is compatible with its existing and future international commitments and with the whole market-orientated thrust of Agenda 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Change is coming and we cannot opt out of that. The fact that we are not opting into the euro is neither here nor there for the purposes of the Committee. We must have arrangements that do not discriminate against UK agriculture, and we must ensure that those arrangements are transitional and fit in with the future thrust of the policy both of the Government and of Agenda 2000, which we wholeheartedly support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will do my best to answer the questions of members of the Committee and to enter into debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Last Thursday, I asked the Vote Office for the papers for the Committee. I was given a copy of the regulation and of the findings of the Select Committee on European Legislation, but the explanatory memorandum from the Ministry of Agriculture was not available. Can you, Mr. Atkinson, advise the Committee when we might have expected to receive that document? In his opening comments, the Minister of State referred at length to the explanatory memorandum, but hon. Members have had minimal time to consider that important paper on this complex matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for the Chair. The Chair's responsibility is to ensure that all the papers are available when the Committee starts. However, I am sure that the Minister has heard the right hon. Member's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can now take questions to the Minister until 11.30 am. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief. There will be ample opportunity for hon. Members to ask more than one question, and I should be grateful if they would ask one question at a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the point about the daily market rate? When he mentioned its application to compensation—or to CAP payments—was he referring to the date on which the decision to make the payment is made, the date of the payment itself, or some other arbitrary date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention is to use the daily market rate at the time of the transaction. Many other countries have said that they might want to average out a set of daily rates over a month, but we do not think that much would be gained from that. However, if there are atypical market movements after the transaction has been agreed but before the delivery, there must be an arrangement to take account of that. It would normally be the market rate when the transaction is agreed, and I fully accept that that could be some time away from the execution of the transaction. If there are atypical market rate movements, the issues must be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to stick as closely as possible to the daily market rate. However, we are examining the case for smoothing out rates over a period. We do not want to build a sub-agrimonetary system inside the current system. That would happen if we started to average out rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made an important point, to which there is no clear response. We intend to use the market rate on the date when the transaction takes place and is agreed. However, the commodities could be delivered or paid for several weeks or months later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Janet Dean 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How close are we to a final decision on the new arrangements? The answer is important to farmers. I am pleased by the subject of the debate—the Committee's previous debate was on fisheries, and I represent one of the most inland constituencies in the country. Therefore, it is good to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
discuss a subject that is relevant to my constituency, because concern will persist until a final decision is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the final decision will be made at the Agriculture Council in December. There is also an Agriculture Council meeting next week. The decision must be made in December, because the euro will be introduced on 1 January. Negotiations are currently taking place, but the final decision about the new system should be made before the introduction of the euro. The date of the December Agriculture Council meeting escapes me, but I suspect that it will be before Christmas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We share the Government's desire to ensure that non-participating countries should not be discriminated against. Is not the risk to our competitive position more likely to arise in the second and third years of the application of the regulations when it is at the discretion of a member state to compensate the 50 per cent. that the regulations envisage? In the light of recent experience of the Government's willingness to compensate under the agrimonetary scheme, could the Minister assure us that British farmers will not be discriminated against?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Lady's point that the European Union will fund 100 per cent. of the compensation in the first year of the regulations. I detected a slight note of implied criticism of the Government in the tone of the hon. Lady's question about the second and third years. We have announced that we shall pay the full £48 million that is available under the agrimonetary compensation scheme this year. Last year, we paid all the money—£75 million—that was available under the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For livestock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, for livestock. That sector needs the most help. We should be judged on our track record. We paid the first tranche of £72.5 million and the second tranche of £48.33 million to the sector that is suffering most. In October 1999, the third tranche of £24.1 million will be available. I cannot say whether that will be paid, because that is next year's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course uncertainty exists, because four countries will not introduce the euro. Therefore, arrangements must be made. We cannot simply claim that we do not want to participate and expect other countries to continue as they are. The way in which the common agricultural policy works means that not making such arrangements would be detrimental to our industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask about paragraph 5 of the explanatory memorandum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which memorandum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister define the daily market rate more clearly? Paragraph 5 states that, on import tariffs, it will not be the daily market rate but the customs monthly rate that will be chosen. There appear to be two differing sets of rates. It would be helpful to know
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
how the relevant daily market rate is to be calculated, and how it will be communicated to farmers and others with an interest in the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has hit upon an important issue. I am sorry that he does not have the second explanatory memorandum, which is a short document. This issue was raised relative to consultations with the farming industry, producers and traders, which began on 15 July. We have not hidden it under a bushel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We produced two memorandums as a result of the two hearings of the Select Committee on European Legislation and the consultations. I refer again to the second memorandum. I am trying to ensure that the position is up to date. We make no bones about having asked for flexibility, because without it our industry could be damaged. We want the issues to be addressed at the relevant sector level in cases where operative events could cause severe problems for a sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may not be possible to say for all transactions that on a given day the market rate might differ. Flexibility is required for times when the market rate may damage parts of the agricultural sector. We are examining that. In cases where sectors would be affected horizontally, we could amend the agrimonetary regulations. We are consulting the relevant agricultural sectors about the precise mechanism, because they need to be told.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present pre-fix position is administratively extremely simple and lets us know where we stand. The pre-fix arrangement gives a degree of certainty about transactions, paperwork and so on. If the pre-fix has to go simply because it cannot be used with the euro, we must have something as good—some process—to take its place at times of enormous market rate fluctuations. We are discussing this with the industry; it is not open and shut. We are telling the Commission that we need flexibility in case things do not go as we think they will, but we cannot be precise and certain about these issues today. Something could crop up in the first week, the first month or the first six months. Therefore, in working the new system we need a different method of settling the rate—for example, by time of day, the first day after or through some smoothing out—in order to get the benefits of the system without our people being damaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is as reasonably detailed an answer as I can give the right hon. Gentleman simply because no one knows the kind of fluctuations that will occur when the euro is alive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Curry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Skipton and Ripon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The explanatory memorandum dated 3 July states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the text envisages that they"</p></blockquote>
—member states—
	<br><blockquote><p>"may make payments in Euro, if they can first satisfy the Commission that they have devised a system which ensures that on the date of payment the national currency equivalent of the Euro amount paid is neither more nor less generous than the payment to those operators opting for national currency."</p></blockquote>
Since then, MAFF has announced that it envisages paying in euros. First, will the Minister explain what the words that I quoted mean? Secondly, will he tell us what, in practice, would happen if a farmer in the dales were to be paid in euros? Would he receive a cheque

designated in euros, hand it to the bank and negotiate the exchange rate? If so, how would the terms of the explanatory memorandum be met?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The easy part of the right hon. Gentleman's question is the last part, although I cannot answer in detail. We announced as recently as last week that we were considering the possibility of starting this process from autumn 2000. If the right hon. Gentleman will kindly tell me which paragraph of the memorandum of 3 July he quoted, I shall do my best to respond to the first part of his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are four non-participating countries. It follows that the 11 will not allow the four that have not joined the euro to benefit from the system more than if they had joined it—we should not expect them to do so. Rather, we are seeking to make arrangements whereby UK agriculture does not suffer as a result of non-participation in the euro. It is reasonable for the other 11 to insist that when currencies fluctuate the pre-ins or opted-outs—however one prefers to look at them—should not benefit simply because they are pre-ins or opted-outs. That is fair: we cannot demand benefit when we have not joined the club, which is the implication behind the right hon. Gentleman's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the final part of the question, it is impossible to say at the moment how a farmer or trader will receive payments or subsidy cheques. The right hon. Gentleman knows that substantial quantities—running to tens and hundreds of millions of pounds—pass weekly through the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at York in support of our agricultural system. I cannot say whether the cheques will be made in euros or converted into our currency before they are made into cheques. We shall have to discuss those details, but we have made it clear in principle that we want to facilitate arrangements for payment in euros for support payments. We are also considering the issue for direct payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton and Honiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister about monetary gaps. Under the current system, the Commission states that the monetary gaps range from between plus 5 per cent. and minus 2.5 per cent. The Minister has rightly said that it is difficult to anticipate what will happen under the new system, particularly regarding the difference between the euro and other currencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister attends the meeting in December, the four non-participating members may be swelled by the admission of central European countries into the European Union. I assume that such countries would not automatically enter as participating members of the single currency. How would those circumstances affect the arrangements? We are dealing with a long-term policy, whatever view is taken of the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The structure of payments is being based on the assumption that there are only four non-participants which, within the short to medium term, may become members of the single currency, but that will not be the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
case if the mid-European countries join. What representations will the Minister make in respect of allowing other countries to join the European Union without being disadvantaged? What would be the cost to the European Union of supporting the currencies of those countries in a similar way as this scheme supports the four non-participating countries now? My question may be rather wordy; has the Minister got the thrust of my argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have got the thrust, but it goes way beyond my brief and the documents before us this morning. The issue is not dealt with in the regulations, was not addressed in the Select Committee and is certainly not covered in the two explanatory memorandums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four pre-in countries—ourselves, Denmark, Sweden and Greece—are pre-in for different reasons in some respects. We each have different points to make in the negotiations. We are satisfied that we can achieve the right mechanism to deal with fluctuations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will see from the memorandums and the proceedings of the Select Committee that compensation is also important. The ideal is simple, but the system is complicated. The aim is to compensate for fluctuations and that involves the issue of trigger thresholds in the neutral margins. If there are currency movements, we want to ensure that our farmers and traders are compensated, but not over-compensated. For some currency movements, there will be no compensation until the change becomes more than 2.6 per cent.—a figure that seems to have been plucked out of the air, I might add. If anyone asks me where it came from I simply cannot tell them. I have asked and the Commission says that it has been plucked out of the air. That fits in with what has happened in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) is absolutely right. All that which is to start on 1 January—both the euro and the agrimoney arrangements for the four pre-in countries—can ultimately be only transitional simply because the Union is due to be substantially enlarged. The compensation ends; there is a three-year transitional period to 2001. If, by then, new countries have joined—I do not know what the dates are—I simply cannot say whether they will be in or out of the CAP because they may be in for some parts and out for others. Nothing is for sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the hon. Lady and the Committee the assurance that the Government will not shortchange British agriculture in the negotiations. I do not know what the United Kingdom's position will be in three years' time. I cannot forecast that. We simply do not know. My response to the next question that anyone may have in their minds is that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be the one to answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the Minister said that if the transitional relief was not put in place to deal with agrimonetary compensation with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
the introduction of the euro, British farmers might experience a payment cut of 11 per cent. to 15 per cent. To follow the logic of his answer to the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), at the end of the transitional compensation period in 2001 is it not likely that farmers in this country will experience a similar decline in payments as a result of the UK's non-participation in the single currency and the absence of transitional relief at that time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not possible to forecast that three years in advance. It is probably not fair to make the jump from the point that I made about what would happen on 1 January. With the euro coming, the green rate freeze goes. The freeze has been of benefit in the last two years to UK agriculture to an estimated tune of £400 million. However, it is not fair or logical, as I understand what is proposed, simply to say that at the end of three years UK agriculture will be short by £400 million. I do not think that it will work like that. It is not possible to forecast how the exchange rate of the euro will work over the period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pooling currency in this way is a massive enterprise for the European Union. While I say that we are in uncharted waters, that does not mean that there are not people out there who know what will happen and will manage it properly. We do not know. But it is not possible to make the jump from talking about the 11 per cent. to 15 per cent. effect from 1 January—if we did not have the compensation—to saying that in three years' time we will be hit or, in other words, we are putting off the evil day. It is not possible to make that assumption. If I am vastly wrong and ill-informed on that, I will no doubt be advised and I will inform the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Skye and Inverness, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the Minister's fault that with these euro instruments, particularly when they refer to the CAP and the green pound, the brief ends up sounding like "Yes Minister" rather than the reality before us this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am having great difficulty making head nor tail of this, as is the Minister and other members of the Committee. May I ask the Minister, on a more basic level, to amplify a little paragraph 18? I refer also to what his right hon. Friend the Minister said in agriculture questions last Thursday 12 November at c.462 about extending the possibility of the option of CAP direct payments to farmers. The Government are obviously in negotiation about this. Clearly, from the farming interest point of view, the sooner progress is achieved here the better. What kind of progress has been achieved, if any, so far? At what stage are the negotiations? When are we likely to get a decision? Do not all these transitional arrangements for either opt-outs or pre-ins—depending on one's political disposition—simply show the nonsense of this country's trying to stay outside the single currency from the outset?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot possibly agree with the hon. Gentleman's description of the Government's policy as nonsense. I do not want to duck the first part of the hon. Gentleman's question, but we made the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
announcement only last week. At present, we have no idea of the scale of requests for payments in euros. I have no doubt that tens of thousands of farmers have probably not even given the matter a moment's thought because we did not say that payment in euros was an option. However, as the date comes closer, negotiators have been raising these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not force anyone to take payments in euros. The national currency will remain. However, until we know what the demand for payment in euros will be, we cannot begin to set up a system. Payment in euros will be an option; it is not a question of all or nothing. However, if farmers see benefits in the option, that is fine. Nothing will be made compulsory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot make the decisions on direct payments and support payments at the same time because some traders will benefit more from being paid in euros than others. Only time will tell. Demand for payments in euros must come from the industry. The Government cannot push it and it would be wrong for us to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The option will become available and we shall enter into negotiations about it as quickly as possible. However, we do not see the option becoming available before the autumn of 2000. We have made it clear that no one will be able to receive payments in euros in 1999. In Whitehall, MAFF is doing very well on the millennium issue, but its commitments on the millennium problems relating to information technology pre-empt our putting any resources in 1999 into the subject of euro payments. However, we shall move as quickly as possible. We made an offer last week and will freely enter into negotiations as soon as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask hon. Members to make their questions short and the Minister to make his answers short? We have half an hour left for questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When discussions take place about the ability of farmers and traders to be paid in euros, will the Minister reassure me that consideration will be given to protecting smaller traders and smaller farmers? They might not find it easy to equip themselves to receive such payments. If large traders and large farmers opt for payments in euros, we must ensure that small farmers are protected. Will the new system make it simpler for small farmers to claim the moneys to which they are entitled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will answer that question briefly, Mr. Atkinson. I take your point. The issues are not straightforward and I regret the length of my answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received no information that small farmers are at a disadvantage when making claims for payments, even though they may not all have computers and information technology. Opposition Members will be aware of the work that we have done to make the forms simpler and easier to understand. The paperwork can be horrendous, but nothing in the proposals will disadvantage small farmers. I am sure that they will understand how to make their claims, either in sterling or in euros.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the option will be made available to farmers in 2000 coincides with the outworking of the millennium bug. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the Commission has made an assessment of the financial implications of the change, and private business must make an assessment of what it will cost corporations to deal with invoices made out in euros and sterling. Will the Minister assure us that those additional costs will not fall on farmers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not exactly clear what the hon. Lady means. The proposed new system for the euro will save the European Union budget 605 million ecu over three years. There is an on-cost in the first year that will disappear in years two and three. Therefore, over three years, there will be a net gain of about £410 million to £420 million to the European Union budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear about the hon. Lady's point on the millennium. I referred to the millennium because MAFF does not have the resources to get its information technology systems up and running if there is a massive demand for payments in euros in 1999. We are currently working towards ensuring that everything works properly at the millennium. We are not prepared to put resources into dealing with payments in euros, because we do not have them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to disadvantage or impose costs on anyone. Resources have been set aside for the millennium, and we do not intend to put any costs on United Kingdom farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dobbin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Heywood and Middleton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Industry must become aware of what is involved. Will the Minister say something about the consultation processes that are taking place and the feedback that he has received?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Substantial consultation took place over the summer. I have not counted up the responses, but there was broad support from the whole industry for the use of market rates. The sugar sector expressed concern about the move to daily market rates because of the relationship between sugar intervention prices and market prices. If prices change every day, there could be a problem drawing up contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a welcome for the 100 per cent. compulsory EU-funded compensation for the green rate freeze change, and a desire for the Commission to make compensation in 2000 and 2001 compulsory rather than discretionary. The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) referred to that earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have consulted tens of dozens of organisations, including key traders in the industry. Consultation cannot take place in five minutes, but, by and large, there has been a broad welcome for the proposals. People asked about payments in euros, and I have dealt with that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confident that agriculture will welcome the Minister's undertaking to give farmers the option of being paid in euros or pounds sterling after the autumn of 2000. However, I have difficulty with paragraph 6 of the explanatory memorandum of 3 July. Farmers may base their decisions on whether to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
be paid in pounds or euros on practical considerations, such as whether their business inputs and outputs correspond to euros. However, the explanatory memorandum implies that, after a farmer has chosen to be paid in euros or pounds sterling, someone could blow the whistle on him if he gains an advantage as a result of his choice. We need to be clear on what is intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 6 of the July memorandum is clear and it is no good sugar-coating it. We will not be able to operate a system, either as an opt-out or pre-in, that is seen to give our producers and farmers an advantage over and above any we would have gained if we had joined. I cannot put it clearer than that. The Commission would not accept it and the auditors would be after us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have held consultations since July, and I have not argued that paragraph 6 is—in the classic phrase—inoperative. We will have to satisfy the Commission and the 11 participating countries that our advantage will not be greater than it would have been if we had joined the club in the first place. We are not writing the rules of the club: the other 11 will have a view. We will not be able to be too generous to ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One may ask what is the use of the option of being paid in euros. We will not be able to answer that question until we enter negotiations, and traders and farmers demand to be paid in euros. For some of them, that option will not be worth while. However, payment in euros must not be treated as a speculative move. The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) did not raise the issue quite so crudely. I shall not sugar-coat the issue: people will not be allowed to use the option for speculative ends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being late this morning, Mr. Atkinson. Newcastle Pullman usually provides a punctual service to London, but today events involving a Virgin train conspired against the normally excellent east coast main line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should try the west coast main line!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) is lost: I said that the east coast main line service was affected. We do not want to get lost in our debates, so will the Minister comment on an observation I have made following frequent visits to hill farmers in my north Yorkshire constituency? Quite often, the farmer's wife undertakes all the paperwork and the bureaucratic aspects of the business. Certainly, when I visit farms in my capacity as the Member of Parliament for Scarborough and Whitby, I have been confronted by the burden of red tape that affects small agricultural businesses, especially hill farmers. Will courses or educational schemes be offered to small businesses in such hard-pressed areas of British agriculture?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a specific answer to that question, but it is a highly constructive suggestion. I shall certainly ensure that the Ministry gives it positive consideration. I shall write to my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn), and I shall share views with members of the Committee. The Ministry facilitates advice and information through its regional service centres, and I shall ensure that it seeks other ways of explaining the workings of the system for the benefit of farmers who are not part of massive enterprises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why there are two different formulas—the market support payment mechanism and that for direct payment for calculating compensation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are different dates for different issues. The operative dates for some of the schemes are pre-set: the date for arable area payments is 1 July, and the date for livestock schemes is 4 January. To minimise distortion, we want daily market rates for everything, as far as that is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, we have had to look differently at annual payments and payments related to events in the market and the fluctuating ecu. Our commitment to offer the option of payment in euros means that we can examine only one area. Until the system is operative, we cannot form a view on whether we can pay the second tranche or the other type of compensation in euros or sterling. Therefore, I cannot give an answer before 1 January, and I am unlikely to be able to give one before 1 February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall address the point made by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill). We shall have to set up a system, approved by the Commission, so that farmers can opt to be paid in euros. When farmers use such an approved and negotiated system they will not be challenged. People will have the option to be paid in euros, and when they have made a choice there is no way that they will then be told that they have chosen the wrong option and that they will be penalised. As long as they conform to the system that has been negotiated and agreed with the European Commission, they will be perfectly okay. I hope that I have not left the hon. Member with any other impression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier on, the Minister made it clear that it was not possible for the Government to establish a system that would give an advantage to UK farmers. Will it remain possible for the Government to protect farmers who are disadvantaged by non-participation in the single currency? What will be the Government's attitude?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new agrimonetary arrangements from 1 January will ensure that UK farmers do not lose out because we have opted out of the single currency, although we are a "pre-in" country for the purposes of joining the euro. That is why the scheme was negotiated with Brussels. The Select Committee has examined it twice and, after dotting the i's and crossing the t's, it will be approved at the December Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
I am not saying that time will tell; the Government are fairly confident that the system will not disbenefit UK agriculture. That is not our intention. However, I can give no guarantee because no one can tell what will happen to the exchange rates for currencies outside the euro when the euro starts. We just do not know. We do not intend that the arrangements that we have made will disbenefit UK agriculture, and we shall revisit the matter daily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter has been negotiated, but revaluations will take place from time to time, as will devaluations, including matters such as appreciable reductions and the compensation to be granted as a result. There will be trigger mechanisms for the payment of compensation, and I have pointed out that no compensation will be granted for the first 2.6 per cent. of an appreciable reduction in market-support payments in any year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a trigger threshold, and we hope that we have set up mechanisms that will work. One of the purposes of our discussions in the Committee is to satisfy ourselves—as far as we can do so—that negotiations will work and will not disbenefit UK agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Currently, this country exceptionally has to pay 71 per cent. of any agrimonetary compensation received from Europe. What will be the position for the 100 per cent. payable for the first year and for the 50 per cent. in future years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 100 per cent. for the first year will be fully funded by the European Union. I do not want to cause confusion, but Agriculture Ministers are asked to do many things: to enter the euro, or to renegotiate the Fontainebleau agreement. Such matters are not our responsibility. In years two and three, when the matter becomes discretionary, I suspect that, in the case of the 71 per cent., the Fontainebleau agreement will have an effect, rather as it does now. However, we shall have to face that matter when we come to it. In the first year, the 100 per cent. will be fully funded by the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pick up on the point made by the hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean). It is a matter for Agriculture Ministers because it has an impact on their departmental budget every year when they negotiate with the Treasury. I urge the Minister of State to raise this matter at the Ministers' meeting in December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Burton said, Britain is a net contributor to the EU budget and that distinguishes us from the other four non-participating countries. Therefore, the availability of agrimoney has an impact on Ministers' discretion to support different parts of the market within the agriculture budget. Earlier, the Minister claimed that the Agriculture Ministers of the 11 participating countries intended that there should be no clear advantage for non-participants. If that is so, it is incumbent upon them to ensure that there are also no disadvantages. That is difficult for a UK Minister because we are net contributors. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Minister should not push the matter into the long grass; he should negotiate in December about the next two to three years for British farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady knows, it is not within the competence of Agriculture Ministers to renegotiate the decisions that were made at Fontainebleau. That is up to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We live daily with the consequences of the Fontainebleau agreement. I appreciate that the previous Government ran to Europe every year for agrimonetary compensation, and experienced the difficulties and benefits of that. They appreciated the difficulties and consequences, and, therefore, did not pay a penny piece. We must now live with the consequences. However, I am not briefed to deal with that, and I am not responsible for it. The Government are responsible, and the decisions are up to the Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the potential for competitive disadvantage if a national scheme allows speculation or an advantageous position, has the Commission issued any guidelines to member states on establishing national schemes? The Commission's auditors have not been successful in bringing to book other member states that have exploited existing rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about the hon. Lady's point about the Commission's auditors. The CAP and the European Union are brought into disrepute and held up to public odium by the sort of figures that were published yesterday in the auditors' report. I make no apology for saying that. We are obviously not in favour of fraud, mispayments or fiddling the books. Lord Tomlinson's work on improving the European Union's audit arrangements is a credit to this country. If the arrangements were as good as those in this country, there would be no outrageous claims of so much fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will be adopted in December. The rules to which the hon. Lady referred are the rules that we have negotiated to operate an agrimonetary system that uses the euro when we are not participating in the euro. The other three non-participating countries have also negotiated such rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to dwell on the point, but there is a general fear in my part of the country that Europe is fraud ridden. The recent auditors' report has done nothing to dispel that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister speculate on the safeguards that could be introduced to anticipate the sort of fraudulent activity that the auditors have found in other parts of Europe? What will be the British position on urging the Commission to provide safeguards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can make a couple of brief points about that. It is important when a report highlights the fact that £2.8 billion of the EU budget has been lost abroad. The Court of Auditors was given that figure in respect of EU expenditure in 1997. Money was wrongly paid, perhaps because of honest mistakes. It is not all fraud. It is worth noting that the error rate for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
agriculture is lower than for other areas of spending. We strongly encourage support measures to improve financial management of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK has a good record of disallowance in respect of CAP payments. We have had problems with ewe premium payments over recent years, with a significant disallowance for 1993–94. More is expected for 1995–96. We have acted to deal with the identified shortcomings.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the Minister developing his themes, and it seems that there is much here that the Minister and the rest of the Committee have to take on trust. I gain a strong sense of a wing and a prayer and an: "It will be all right on the night—maybe".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Government have been in office for 18 months and that they had the UK presidency of the Council for part of that period, is it not late in the day to negotiate putting these systems into operation? We knew that the euro was going to start at the turn of the calendar year, yet, on the issue of CAP direct payments, the Minister tells us that there is no chance of funds being made available before autumn 2000. The Government—and it probably applies to their predecessors too—could have moved the issue further up the agenda in the past 18 months than they have. We are about to enter this new regime, but the compensatory measures are not yet in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The blame does not fall wholly on the Government. The pack of papers before us setting out the regulations were received as recently as 12 June. They were subject to some negotiations beforehand. The Government cannot consult industry and farmers until the plan of action is before us. We began consultation on 15 July, so we should not be criticised for such a short delay. The Select Committee has twice considered the memorandums—once before consultation and once after. The Government have had to deal with the points raised in the Select Committee. I understand the tone of the hon. Gentleman's comments, but the fault does not lie with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
In answering that question, the Minister should bear in mind the fact that it is not just a question of speculation or profiting: there is also the question of risk. The Minister repeatedly expresses concerns about speculation: the farmer may believe that there is an equal prospect of risk in the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be personal but, looking at the hon.

Once we have negotiated an agreed system with the European Union—we are currently doing so—for people to choose whether to receive payment in euros, if farmers follow the rules there will be no come-back. It will be their choice: we are not pushing them. There is no compulsion. We are not members of the European Union 	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—I mean of the euro club. It will be for individuals to decide. I cannot go beyond what I have already said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am on my feet, I should like to make another point to the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) to set the record straight. I thought that I had answered his point about the compensation effects for direct and support payments. The effects of the appreciable revaluations on direct payments are very clear. That is one of the big advantages, but the link between the appreciable revaluations and market support payments is less demonstrable. That is why we are obliged to work them separately and why we can make the commitment on the one for 2000, but not on the other until we have had a further look at the arrangements as they come in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should first like to commiserate with the Minister for having to grapple with a technical subject on a day when he is perhaps not feeling on his best form. We wish him a speedy recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important technical subject. Agrimonetary compensatory amounts have in the past resulted in considerable expenditure from the public purse when we endeavoured to deal with the problem of fluctuating currencies in relation to the application of a common policy. We have come here, not to discuss the philosophy of participation in the scheme, but to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
debate the practical aspects of the way in which British farmers could be affected by the change in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We share the Government's anxiety that our nonparticipating status should not disadvantage farmers. I am sure that that is a cross-party position. However, a number of questions remain in my mind. I hope that we can return to some of those points in the speeches that follow and in the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister answered in part my question about the unfortunate coincidence of the introduction of the euro with the millennium bug, and I am sure that agriculture is not the only sector that is regretting that coincidence. I had the good fortune to sit on the Select Committee on Science and Technology, which examined the preparedness of the public and private sector for the turn of the century events. There is a marked contrast between the public and private sectors in that respect. Contrary to what the Minister said, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is not the most advanced of Government Departments in its preparations—hence my concern about its ability to deliver farmers the choice of banking in euros at the same time as grappling with the date change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point was that there are some additional costs. Those will apply to the private as well as the public sector when the dual payment system is introduced. I am worried that the costs that the Ministry incurs in creating the dual system may fall on the farmers. I am particularly anxious that the coincidence of accommodating the date change with the Ministry's intention to allow farmers to receive their payments in euros, if they so wish, may delay any payments in that year. The medium-term forecast for farming shows that the sector can ill afford more delays in payment or disruption, or any additional costs that may be imposed on it as a result of these changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister mentioned a number of things that still need to be properly negotiated and decided to ensure that there are no loopholes in the system that the Commission envisages, I should like to return to several points. He mentioned the vexed question of when the operative event occurs in the establishment of agricultural payments, and drew attention to the difference between agricultural sectors. However, across the sectors there are problems with payment systems in relation to intervention and export restitutions. I am still concerned about how the right point at which to spot the euro rate against national currencies will be judged. Could the Minister assure me that there is no risk of tenders being withdrawn as a result of the acceptance date being selected as the point in time at which the euro is fixed? It is clear that if national currencies of non-participating countries move substantially in the time lag that ensues before a tender for an export restitution is accepted, there is a genuine risk of tenders being withdrawn—which, in relation to intervention, for example, could cause special difficulties for the management of the market. That could leave the Commission's authorities in difficulty on account of uncertainty about whether exports or intervention operations will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
I remain concerned about the capacity that member states still have to give farmers some sort of leg up through the establishment of national schemes in nonparticipating countries. This country has always been honest in applying the letter of the law established in Community regulations. However, we know that state aids have been given by other member states which, somewhere in their cultural ethos, consider it acceptable to bend the rules slightly to give their farmers an advantage. I want to place on the record our concern that the Commission's auditors, especially now that their recent track record is in public view, may not have been vigilant enough in spotting the advantage that some member states may be giving their farmers through their own national schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, responsibility for the most important issue here—the decision about whether to contribute the 50 per cent. required for farmers to receive the full compensation under the envisaged scheme—will lie fairly and squarely with the Government in years two and three of the application of the regulations. The Minister pointed out that eventually the Government availed themselves of agrimonetary compensation for some of the sectors that were worst placed in the present farming crisis. However, that came late—for some businesses, too late. I should like the Minister's assurance that the Government will not take the same dilatory approach in playing their full part in compensating farmers for fluctuations in our national currency in relation to the euro under the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) in drawing attention to our serious concern about the practical application of these measures. The Minister will be aware of my concern, especially about the payment option. There is little doubt that the industry wants the option of being able to draw the payments in either euros of sterling. As the Minister rightly said, at present there is no means of gauging what the take-up will be for either basis. Some farmers will have to weigh up the practical considerations of whether they want euros coming into a euro bank account because they have corresponding expenditure going out of their farm account. Others will not want to open a euro account. Farmers must consider these practicalities. As I hinted earlier, risks are involved. Individual farmers will scratch their head and ask themselves whether they want payment in euros, or whether, for example, the pound might be stronger than the euro. The Minister should take greater cognisance of those practical considerations that will be in farmers' minds, instead of placing such emphasis on the risk that someone might use the opportunity to speculate in currency. That will not be so with the average farmer; his consideration will be purely practical. That is not to say that there are not some Mr. Bigs in the agriculture industry—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh really?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being frank with the Minister, who knows that I am an honest man who always tells the truth, please or offend. There are Mr. Bigs but—the Minister may not agree here—they have been spawned by the policy that we are discussing: the common agricultural policy. We were initially led to believe that it was for the benefit of the small farmer and would help our agriculture industry to carry on as it had in the past. However, the Minister will be the first to recognise that more of our farming is being done by fewer and bigger enterprises. The benefit of the CAP to traditional family farms is highly questionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not unhappy about the prospect of the option on payments being deferred until autumn 2000. Some in the agriculture industry would like it immediately and might criticise the Government for not making it available immediately. However, I am not worried about the option being postponed until 2000, because serious decisions must be made in the meantime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt that there is an hon. Member in the House who could put his hand on his heart and express confidence that the millennium bug will not cause a degree of chaos in our society, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on computers. A good case could be made for putting off what can be put off until after the millennium, to avoid further unnecessary complications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other forums I have asked whether starting the single currency on 1 January 1999 might be best postponed until millennium bug problems are solved. If there are two king-sized problems, one of which can be postponed and the other of which cannot, it is common sense to postpone the one that can be while dealing with the problems of the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the period until autumn 2000 we shall all have the opportunity to see how the euro works in practice. Farmers will want to take that experience into account when they elect to take their payments in euros or sterling. I envisage that farmers will have the option of electing for one or the other at one point in time, and thereafter will have to live with the consequences of their decision instead of being allowed to play the field. Will the Minister clarify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way in which the hon. Gentleman puts it is too bold and black-and-white. Around autumn 2000 at the earliest, support payments may be made by the Intervention Board. Direct payments are still being considered, so there may not be a specific time at which the farmer can elect to take all payments in euros, because of the nature of the two streams of payments. The second stream is still under consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will accept my comments in the spirit in which they are intended regarding support payments—the imminent prospect. I repeat that it may be a blessing in disguise that the Government are not proposing to deal with them until autumn 2000 because of the considerations that I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal briefly with agrimonetary compensation payments in general. The hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean) said that 71 per cent. of some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
payments would come from the UK Treasury. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton made the significant point that British taxpayers, including British farmers, will contribute significantly to the central fund in Brussels, which is paid out in agrimonetary compensation to other countries. The Fontainebleau agreement obliges the Treasury to put its hand in its pocket for 71 per cent. of the monetary compensation, so it is unfair that this country should not be paid the maximum allowed under the legislation. As I said, the money paid by Brussels to other countries comes out of the taxes that British people have put into the pot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the matter not from the Treasury's view, but from that of people interested in agriculture and from that of the Minister. Whatever the Treasury's concerns, every pound that goes into agriculture benefits agriculture. Therefore, the Minister should constantly argue for the maximum amount of allowable payments to be paid to British agriculture, which is in crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the Minister batting the problem back to Conservative Members by asking, "What did you do when you were in charge?" That is not the point. The dogs have barked, the caravan has moved on and British agriculture is in a much deeper crisis now than it was under the previous Government. We did not hear such complaints and there were no demonstrations when we were in office. Such protests have been a feature of the past 18 months. The Minister and the Government must recognise that fact and fight for all their worth to make the payments, to which we are entitled and to which British taxpayers have subscribed, available to the agricultural community and the countryside. The consideration should not be where the money comes from, but how we get it to the rural areas where the crisis is deep and worsening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add to the remarks of the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) on the position of agriculture. The claim that the industry's problems started on 1 May 1997 does not stand up to scrutiny. I say that not as a Government supporter, but as one of their critics on agriculture, and especially agrimonetary compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I toured my constituency before the 1997 general election, I saw enormous anger at the way in which the previous Administration had handled the BSE crisis. If we are to have an honest debate on the difficulties facing agriculture, we should at least reflect on the fact that the Government inherited appalling problems in the livestock sector. However, they have been dilatory in dealing with the scale of the problem. Even the announcement made at the beginning of this week will merely take the worst edge off the agricultural crisis. It no way near provides a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate is interesting because it is one of the first on the practical difficulties that will face some sectors and industries because of the United Kingdom's non-participation in the single currency. We have heard about the consequences of that and about the problems that farmers will encounter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
The Minister's remarks will create uncertainty. The farming community is not clear what arrangements and support will be in place in the first year after the introduction of the euro. The Minister regularly says that more agricultural sectors need to operate on a market basis. However, these arrangements and the UK's non-participation in the single currency mean that farmers will continue to run the risk of not operating at market prices because of the currency fluctuations to which they are exposed. That depends on the currency in which their payments are made. Farmers will continue to undertake currency transactions because the United Kingdom is not joining the single currency. That will add to farmers' risk profile. Therefore, there is a contradiction between the Government's desire for farming to operate on a market basis and the handicap that they place on farmers by not participating in the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is about compensation. Limited compensatory arrangements exist. In infer from the Minister's answers to questions that the compensation will eventually be limited, and that, in the fullness of time, farmers will remain uncertain about compensatory arrangements. I fear that the Government will not support farmers on agrimonetary compensation as much as they have done in the past two years because we are not participating in the single currency. There have been many complaints about the extent of Government support to farmers. However, when the transitional arrangements come to an end and farmers are exposed to the realities of a different agrimonetary compensation regime, the Government will leave them very much on their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government cannot provide advantageous conditions for farmers because the United Kingdom is not participating in the single currency. That is crystal clear. However, it is not clear whether the Government can or will protect farmers from disadvantageous conditions that will result from the United Kingdom's non-participation. That leaves us in the position that we were in after the announcement of the agriculture package on Monday. There are short-term agricultural assistance initiatives, but until the agriculture sector believes that there is a sustainable, coherent strategy for the medium to longer term, uncertainty will continue in that vulnerable but precious sector of the economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.53 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall pick up on a point that the Minister made on agrimonetary compensation, which forms an important part of the regulation that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should consider the previous Government's reasons for not activating the mechanism. Today, farming faces a unique set of circumstances. Those involved in farming cannot recall a time when all sectors were simultaneously confronted with massively falling prices, adverse currency movements and no hope of change. Under the Conservative Government, when adverse currency
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
movements occurred, prices in other sectors—perhaps those most affected by the change in currency—sometimes rose. Not all sectors faced calamity simultaneously. If we are to have a sensible, adult debate, the previous Government's reasons for not pressing the agrimonetary button should be considered carefully, not simply through the Minister's selective quoting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one disputes that agrimonetary arrangements entail a cost. I remember grappling with the previous agrimonetary regime when I did the Minister's job. It is complex, and national Parliaments have to pay a bill. Therefore, its use should be considered carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that worries me is that, ever since they came to power, the Government have been fearsomely lobbied by the farming industry. It is begging them, because of this unique set of circumstances, to do something about activating the mechanisms that preceded those that we are discussing today. Only now, 18 months on, are we starting to see a little more generosity. The Government pressed the button in a small way a year ago, and now they have had to press it again. That is why there will be great concern in farming circles about how agrimonetary compensation will work under the new arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right when he said that there will be uncertainty about the way in which the new euro-sterling mechanisms will work. Has his right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had any discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer about building into MAFF's baseline some contingency funding for possible payments of compensation due—as the Minister rightly pointed out—to likely variations and unforeseen circumstances when the euro is introduced? Some commentators have speculated that there will be massive gyrations of sterling versus the euro. I do not know whether that is true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am doing this exercise of "compare and contrast" to show that, because farmers have had to battle supremely hard to get the Government to come up with the current package of help, they will greatly fear that they will have to go through the battling process all over again. If the compensation mechanism needs to be activated, they will want to know whether there will be some certainty of support or whether they will have to lobby very hard indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise that because, although article 4 of the regulation might seem straightforward, unfortunately time has prevented us from probing in greater depth the annexe that describes how the article operates. If I have understood article 4 correctly, it deals with the market support mechanism. We discover that the compensation would not necessarily come as one package, but could be phased payments. Then we find that, in the calculation of the first of those payements.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The flat-rate income loss referred to in Article 4(2) shall be equal to: (a) the sum of I per cent. of final agricultural production of"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
a range of commodities and
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the value of quantities of products supplied under a contract imposing, in accordance with Community rules, a minimum price to the producer, for products not referred to in the first indent, and of aid or premiums paid to farmers, with the exception of those referred to in Article 5; (b) after substraction of"—</p></blockquote>
and a series of items are listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are incredibly complex matters and need to be exposed, in the interests of transparency, if farmers, traders and others are to have any real idea of how the mechanism works. The Minister has prayed in aid the lack of detail as the reason why he cannot answer some questions today. The annexes to the regulation contain every possible detail to help United Kingdom Ministers to answer these questions. That detail exists. If the matter is to be agreed within the next month, the Minister will know that his officials have been to management committees and have been arguing out the detail. The Minister's own words point that out to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the problems that the Minister faces, but there is a great deal of detail. It is complex, but it needs exposing. In making my second point to the Minister, I should like to support all those right hon. and hon. Members who have spoken in the debate. Will the Minister give us a clear undertaking today that, when the deal is done, the Ministry will publish and put out on the internet a guide in plain English to explain to traders, farmers and others exactly how the mechanism is to operate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate exposes the lamentable state of the explanatory memorandum. Yesterday, on the Floor of the House, we had a debate about methods of improving the scrutiny of European legislation. I feel strongly on that matter and I supported the Government's proposals because they were good and sensible. The explanatory memorandum offers us a series of words, but it does not give us a guide in plain English on how this complex regulation will operate. It would have been of assistance to hon. Members and to those who follow our affairs if some notes on clauses, or a layman's guide to the operation of the mechanism, had been appended to the explanatory memorandum. It might have compared and contrasted the current system with the future one. I sympathise with the Minister; this is complicated stuff, but people need to know how it will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to dwell on one or two points of detail. The Minister mentioned a subject that interested me: the 2.6 per cent. variation factor before any compensation could be paid. He chose some wonderfully useful and descriptive words. He said that the figure was "plucked out of the ether". It was not. Somebody, somewhere in the Commission, must have thought about whether the figure should be 2.4, or 3, or some other number. That person would have been guided by some kind of objective assessment, because that is how such things are done. A Commission official did not wake up one morning, think of the number 2.5 or 2.6 and say, "That's what it will be".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
Clearly, the Minister's interest was aroused by the matter. Why did not he, or his officials, probe the Commission or the Council about the figure? How do we know that it is the right figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton and Honiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to share with my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde a comment from "Agra Europe", Commission document E/1, published in 1997:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The biggest problem with EMU, however, will be the need to eliminate existing 'monetary gaps' between green rates and market rates."</p></blockquote>
The document points out that the normal spread of gaps under the current system is between plus 5 per cent. and minus 2.5 per cent. The Commission gave a clear definition, presumably achieved through discussion and statistical analysis. Does my hon. Friend agree that it must be possible for a similar scale for the new system to be produced within the Council of Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In making the previous agrimonetary arrangements, a great deal of thought was given to such limits and boundaries in relation to the cost implications and also to the speed of adjustment to upward or downward movements in currencies versus the green rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) made a good point, which illustrated the precision in determining the previous arrangements. Now, a Minister of the Crown has come before the House of Commons to tell us that the figure of 2.6 per cent. was plucked out of the ether. Perhaps he is right; let us give him the benefit of the doubt. If that was the case, the British Government, in their usual rigorous way, should find out the details about why the figure was plucked from the ether. If the Minister cannot answer now, perhaps we may be enlightened through correspondence, when he has had a chance to ask the Council. This kind of thing gives discussion about European matters a bad name. If we ask a straightforward question about how a number was arrived at and are told that it was plucked out of the ether, it is hardly surprising that the European Union has a bad reputation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell the Committee whether there will be moneys in a contingency fund in MAFF to pay compensation? The second half of the compensation package deals with the fact that 50 per cent. of the moneys must come from national sources if that part of the package is payable. That is slightly different from the present arrangements. Compensation is more expensive under Fontainebleau now, and the package looks like a cheaper buy, but farmers will want some degree of certainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know what the Minister thinks about events that may occur after 2002. Paragraph 8 of his first explanatory memorandum states that the current compensation arrangements appear to run out after that date. We should like to know what will happen in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to consider matters connected with the payment of support—direct or indirect—in euros. I share the concern that MAFF will take a long time to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
make that facility available. I have listened to the Minister's argument, but I do not accept it. However, I would like to ask him some specific questions. Will farmers who elect to receive their payments in euros be allowed to have such payments paid into a non-United Kindom bank account? If farmers can pay their United Kingdom taxes—assuming that they are making a taxable profit—in euros, why can they not receive all their payments in euros?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that the Government were still thinking about integrated administration and control system payments. Why are they doing that? The matter seems straightforward. If the Minister were to say that, in principle, all payments could be made in euros, I would accept that such payments could not be made yet for technical reasons. Why does he say that payment in euros can be made in terms of direct market support, but that such payment cannot be made yet because the Government are still thinking about it? He did not tell us how long that thinking process would take. That is yet another element of uncertainty in a time of considerable change.

In due course, the Minister might be able to comment on how changes in Agenda 2000 will impact on this area. I will not trespass on such matters, because they are beyond the scope of our debate, and, in fairness to the Minister, I realise that negotiations and discussions on Agenda 2000 have a long way to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a debate about practicalities. I accept that there will be uncertainty. However, in the interests of transparency and farmers' education, I hope that the Minister and his Ministry will go out of their way to help people to understand fully what the changes will mean as soon as they come into operation, if not before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have so much support from Conservative Members for our preparations for the euro. They do not want to have anything to do with that currency for a minimum of 10 years, and yet they have the brass neck to ask me what will happen on 2 January 1999. Frankly, it is preposterous that euro-sceptics should argue that farmers should be compensated for everything that goes wrong with the euro, overcompensated for everything that goes right with it, and that they should be able to open Swiss bank accounts to receive payments in euros. Having got that off my chest—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The record will show that I was the first person to mention the figure of 2.6 per cent. this morning. I was not asked about that figure: I offered it up because I wanted to be open as possible about the uncertainties surrounding agrimonetary compensation. The figure did not make sense in the papers that I have received, so it would be useful to put on record how the Commission decided on a neutral margin of 2.6 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
The Commission's proposals state that agrimonetary compensation will not be payable to market supports for the first 2.6 per cent. of an appreciable revaluation. The figure of 2.6 per cent. first arose in discussions over regulation 942/98, which amended existing regulations to determine measures and compensation relating to appreciable revaluations that affect farm incomes. In April 1998 the Commission proposed—and the management committee agreed—a 2.6 per cent. neutral margin for all agrimonetary compensation. The justification at the time was based on the rules of the current system under which an appreciable revaluation is treated. However, the new arrangements will be different from the current ones, so the logic is less clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission said in management committees that the 2.6 per cent. figure continued existing arrangements, which was repeated by a senior Commission official at a conference during the summer. He said that it was an
	<br><blockquote><p>"arbitrary figure resulting from the experience of the past".</p></blockquote>
France raised questions about the margins. Although there is justification for the 2.6 per cent. neutral margin in the current system, it is hard to justify that specific figure in the new arrangements. However, the UK continues to support the neutral margin as a way of avoiding overcompensation, reducing distortion in competition and reducing costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone can examine what happened in the past decade. Regarding questions about the non-payment of agrimonetary compensation by the previous Government, no one can deny that during the early 1990s there was on average a very substantial increase in farm incomes. I accept that there has been a substantial decrease over the past couple of years. However, one cannot wipe out the past. It is fair to say that farmers were knocking on MAFF's doors on 1 May last year as a result of what had already affected them. All their problems did not start on 1 May. It would not be fruitful to debate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Fylde spoke about a series of market effects and distortions—the collapse of the Russian economy, problems in the far east, a fall in the value of sterling and so forth. I understand that the only sector thus far not affected is potatoes, though I may be contradicted on that. Every other sector has been affected by all those problems taking place at the same time. In the past, two or three ups were matched by a few downs, but some of the effects have been smoothed out, notwithstanding the substantial rise in farm incomes during the 1990s. Some problems need to be pursued and we must consider where we are now rather than look back to the past. We should learn the lessons from the past but look to the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to one of the right hon. Gentleman's specific questions, I freely admit that I have not given much thought to what will happen after 2002. That may be a defect, but it is difficult to do so in 1998 as we try to grapple with issues arising from crisis in the industry. However, I am reliably informed that others have given such thought, so by the time we arrive at 2002 it will not be a surprise to us.

I was asked whether a farmer, having opted for euro payments, would have to stick with that decision for ever. That will depend on the detailed plan that we shall draw up with the European Commission, which, as I have said, is still being discussed. By and large, it is likely that the farmer or trader will have to be tied in for a period: when an option is made there will probably be a time limit on the period during which they stay in. They would have to decide their option on a specific date, which might vary because of the sector they are in. Such rules may apply, but we have not had final discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor is the type of payment—whether it is direct or market support. We do not yet have the scheme, but once people make their option, the chances are that they will not have to be locked into it for ever—or for as long as we are outside the euro. We want to negotiate some degree of certainty and flexibility. But yes, they are likely to have to opt in for a specified period, perhaps from a specific date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point was raised several times by the hon. Member for Ludlow, so obviously I did not answer it adequately. I do not want anything that I have said today to imply that United Kingdom farmers are a bunch of currency speculators. Perhaps some of the Mr. Bigs to whom the hon. Member for Ludlow referred might be, because they regularly move money across frontiers. However, I did not wish to imply that at all. I have tried to make it clear that we are on the outside. We are still part of the common agricultural policy, which is crucial for our farming industry: we are locked into it. Rules will be forced upon us, so we have to negotiate as best we can to ensure that our people are not disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speculation and risk have to be balanced. I fully accept—and agree with the hon. Member for Ludlow—that decisions that farmers make involve a risk. These regulations, coming after our negotiations with the Commission, attempt to ensure that our farmers do not get an automatic advantage—or an automatic disadvantage—because of currency fluctuations, because we have chosen the first day or the end of the trading day, or becuase we have smoothed out an average for a month. I do not know because we have yet to go down that road. We are satisfied that we have a system that does not lock people into an automatic long-term advantage—or disadvantage—because we are not allowed to do that. That is most important. We shall do our best to negotiate a system that is satisfactory for a wide range of members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate a point that I made when I intervened on the hon. Member for Ludlow. I do not want to give the Committee a wrong impression, because I have genuinely done my best to explain the position. The announcement by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food last week related only to support payments. However, we said that we would seek direct payments from autumn 2000. The subject of direct payments is a fairly crucial distinction that we are still discussing. The right hon. Member for Skipton
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
and Ripon (Mr. Curry) asked whether—it is possible that my answer did not correct his assumption—come autumn 2000, farmers will be able to opt for payments that they receive under the common agricultural policy, such as intervention payments or direct subsidies—the whole shebang—to be in euros. That is not so; it is not what we are offering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Tiverton referred to new members of the European Union, and made the important point that non-participating countries could be held to be at a disadvantage compared with participants. As hon. Members can imagine, there have been a great deal of negotiations about this. The effect of these agrimoney arrangements is to bring both participants and non-participants in the euro closer to the market. We want to agree a result that aligns with what we hope will be the outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. None of us wants British farmers to be saddled with the albatross of the current CAP around their necks. I want them to be able to compete genuinely in open markets. They could clean up in some sectors, particularly the dairy sector, but they are prevented from doing that now. If it were not for the crazy system of quotas and the CAP, the UK dairy industry would be a flourishing world-class industry that would be able to wipe the floor with most of its competitors. However, we want to move towards that position without damaging the industry. When we get there, we want to reap the benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a mistake to suggest that farmers and traders from countries participating in the euro will no longer face risks. Because Germany, France and Italy are joining the euro does not mean that their farmers will not face risks. In fact, some member states have expressed concern that the pre-ins—that is us, the opt-outs—might gain from not participating. One can imagine the internal pressures that will be put on the Governments of those countries during the negotiations. Therefore, we must find an approach that is satisfactory for the whole European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Fylde mentioned article 4, which is complex. The mechanism for calculating the amount available is similar to the mechanism in the current system. Although it is complicated, there has been no actual change. We are not entering a brand new system on 1 January, and I would not want to give the impression that we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Fylde asked about the difference between direct payments and support payments. I do not want to avoid that question, because it is much better to put something on the record in 	<i>Hansard</i> than to send letters. People ask why we are not offering payments in euros for direct payments at the same time as market support. I touched on that point when I referred to the different effects of market fluctuations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main benefits of a euro income stream will be felt by traders dealing in euros every day. That does not just involve agriculture, but goes right across the economy and involves the rest of industry in Europe. Most of the demand for euro payments has come from traders, and the emphasis has been placed on enabling such payments to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
Farmers receiving direct payments will continue to receive them in sterling until we are confident that we can offer the option of payment in euros without risk to other services. The level of interest in receiving euro payments is unclear. The option has just been offered. Many farmers might like the option, but might not take it up. Therefore, there must be further consultation, and MAFF will be active in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Setting up the payment and audit systems is a significant demand on our resources. The comprehensive spending review exists for all to see, and MAFF does not have any spare resources. Anyone who heard my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on Monday will realise that the payments he announced have come from the reserve. They have not come from any fat in MAFF: there is not any. We have examined the budgets of Government Departments in order to meet our manifesto commitments on health and education. Because there is no fat left in MAFF, we have had to go to reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the right hon. Member for Fylde—without reading or checking notes—that no money has been set aside for possible fluctuations next year. We must examine and deal with them when they arise, and then negotiate with the Treasury. We are considering possible demand and the feasibility of our commitment. We want to provide as much advice as possible to farmers and to the industry to enable them to seize all the advantages of the onset of the euro, although we are not participating in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We embrace the new developments; the Government are trying to encourage industry to understand what will happen on 1 January 1999. The Opposition criticise us for the advertising campaigns about the euro. It is not true that we are advertising; I am not being churlish. We are spending money on informing people about what will happen. Businesses will be affected, and the United Kingdom's non-participation is no excuse for not finding out what will happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I press the Minister, because hon. Members from both sides of the Committee asked for clarity. I welcome what he has said, but can he clarify the way in which the information will be communicated to farmers, traders and others? Will there be a publication, and will information be made available on the internet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once we have made assessments, and held discussions after consultation to ascertain the scale of the information that is required, we shall take action. Whatever we do, it will be presented in plain English—that is the only way in which to communicate the effects to farmers—and will be published and put out on the internet. MAFF makes good use of the internet; our website is visited 50,000 or 60,000 times a month. We have websites on bovine spongiform encephalopathy and bovine tuberculosis as well as a general website. We are keen to provide information on the internet because it is useful to the farming community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
We shall not hide our light under a bushel. As soon as we have ideas, packages and information on making the best use of the system, we shall disseminate them. We shall not be "old MAAF". That is not a criticism of the previous Government. We shall not be secretive and refuse to talk to people. We must go beyond the farming community becuase of the interaction with people who trade with farmers. The whole economy will be affected by the introduction of the euro, even though we are not participating. Some firms have not yet worked that out. The Government have a large task, but there is also a national requirement to ensure that no one is disadvantaged. We will use our best endeavours to ensure that information is disseminated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is aware that the banks are proactive in raising farmers' expectations of the benefits of banking in euros. Will the Minister assure us that as a matter of national interest, the potential customer will receive balanced information from the Ministry about the risks and benefits of doing that? From today's debate, I have the distinct impression that the responsibility for risk rests with the individual farmer. The Government have a clear responsibility to challenge slightly the big advantages that banks would gain from selling the product to the farmer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that MAFF was not in the business of underwriting individual business men's risk taking. As the two former agriculture Ministers present know, any information and advice that we provide will be cleared with lawyers. We must be fair in explaining the advantages and disadvantages. If farmers get advice from their bankers that the euro is the holy grail, they will be well advised to sup with a long spoon and check matters out with their lawyers and accountants. In other words, although time is short—there are only a few weeks before the new agrimonetary regime starts, and it looks as though things have been done in a rush—there will be no great immediate effect on our industry. As I said, nothing is being offered until autumn 2000. As the hon. Member for Ludlow said, we are concentrating on the prior issue of the millennium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say a brief word about the read-across between the agrimonetary system and Agenda 2000? The thrust of both is to get agriculture away from its present artificial position and bring it closer to the market. I made that clear particularly with respect to the dairy industry. Both should make the European Union position on agriculture more acceptable to our world trading partners, and we should remember that the World Trade Organisation negotiations are looming. Both the agrimonetary system and Agenda 2000 should reduce distortions in production and trade—the key objective of the exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We attach great importance to decisions—based on the Cardiff timetable—to secure radical change in surplus areas and more competitive and environmentally friendly production. That is the thrust of the Government's aim to reform the common agricultural policy. As everyone understands, we

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
cannot take unilateral action but require the support of our 14 partners, which is neither straightforward nor easy to obtain. We are making our best endeavours to obtain such support. I hope that I have provided the Committee with some idea of how the Government intend to proceed from our current position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

arrangements to be applied under the Common Agricultural Policy with a view to the introduction of the euro; and supports the Government's intention to support the proposals which simplify the current agrimonetary arrangements by moving to a system which more closely reflects market realities, reducing the costs to taxpayers, consumers and businesses, and also the scope for distortions of competition whilst respecting UK international obligations without discriminating against those Member States not participating in the euro.</p></blockquote></p>
