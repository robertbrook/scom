<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. As you know, the Committee has been convened to debate the large apparent increase in the United Kingdom's contribution to the European Union's budget—an increase next year of nearly 32 per cent., as against this year. In its observations about the need for the debate, the Select Committee on European Legislation observed that the Government's explanation for the increase was
<br><blockquote><p>"to say the least, Delphic"</p></blockquote>
and called for the publication of an explanatory note that elucidated the figures.<br><br>
On Monday, when I picked up the bundle of documents that was to be debated in the Committee, there was no such explanatory note. I checked again yesterday to see if the Vote Office had made a mistake, but was assured that the set of documents was complete. Just over an hour ago, I went to the Vote Office to check the documentation and I was handed an undated and unsigned note, but evidently one that was designed to be the response to the criticisms of the Select Committee.<br><br>
No effort has been made to contact me about the note. I cannot speak for my hon. Friends, but I am the Opposition spokesman for European finance and it is impossible for me to absorb in such a short time what is, by definition, a complex document which is to meet a criticism that the orginal documents were opaque. There was no chance whatever for me to read and absorb the information in the explanatory note prior to the debate. Not only was that a gross discourtesy to me—we may hear from other members of the Committee if they have been treated similarly—but it makes it impossible for the sitting to proceed. One can see by glimpsing at the pile of documents the complexity of the subject.<br><br>
I ask that you adjourn the sitting, Mr. O'Hara, to give all members of the Committee an adequate opportunity to read the complete documentation, as requested by the Select Committee. We can then have a proper debate.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I recognise the problems for Opposition Members in getting through the vast pile of documentation that is available for European Standing Committees. I take the business of scrutiny very seriously. That is why, as soon as the Committee was established on 14 July, I sought an opportunity for it to sit.<br><br>
Last week, the Select Committee on European Legislation raised some extremely technical points, and I insisted that the fullest possible explanations were given. I accept the point made by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) about the documentation being Delphic. We have followed the conventions of the previous Government but, hopefully, over time we shall adopt procedures that are less Delphic.<br><br>
I received the finalised work of Treasury officials at roughly noon yesterday—they had received the request for it on Friday of last week. I have the explanatory note plus the letter. I instructed immediately that it be taken over to the House of Commons where I understood that it had been made available to hon. Members in the Vote Office. I accept that it is difficult to absorb some of the many complex issues—obviously so, because the right hon. Member for Wells, who is a former Paymaster General, makes a striking error in insisting that there are increases in the Community budget. He knows full well what the issues are and we shall be debating them later.<br><br>
There is no implied discourtesy towards the Opposition. Indeed, in the fullness of time, I hope that we can be helpful to all Opposition parties and everyone interested in Community budgetary matters by providing more accessible and clearer information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I am sure that the hon. Lady does not want to mislead the Committee, but she has done so inadvertently. She said that the request for the extra work was not received by the Treasury until Friday of last week. I have checked with the Clerk to the Select Committee who said that immediately after the Committee sat, which I understand was last Tuesday, the request was transmitted to the Treasury. The hon. Lady's explanation in that respect is, therefore, wrong, and I should be grateful if she would correct that part of her explanation, which in any case I regard as wholly inadequate. She is conceding now that the documentation is complete. She accepts that it is "Delphic" and that the attempt to correct it has just reached the Committee—and me personally—only an hour ago. That reinforces the need for an immediate adjournment so that the Committee can properly scrutinise these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I have listened carefully to the right hon. Member for Wells. He and I have previously crossed swords in different capacities in this Committee.<br><br>
I am sure that he does not want to mislead the Committee either, in the sense that I hope he is not suggesting that when he was the Minister responsible,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0529">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
the Committee did not receive information that was also rather later in coming than the original documents. I remember, as I am sure he does, that that happened. I am a little concerned at the suggestion that we should adjourn an extremely important debate on an extremely important issue because the right hon. Gentleman is worried about not receiving some information until today. I received the information a little earlier today and found it very readable and interesting. It certainly assists in our consideration of the documents. However, the meat of our debate is contained in the documents that we have had in our possession since last Monday. I hope that we shall have no truck with a point of order that seeks to adjourn an extremely important debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has referred to me, I shall respond. He alleged that in the previous Parliament, the Government at the time, of which I was a member, also failed to deliver documentation until the day of the debate. That is categorically untrue, which I know from my own experience. As we are fortunate enough to have some officials in the relevant Department present at our proceedings, would it be in order, Mr. O'Hara, for the Economic Secretary to confer and then to reject and contradict the erroneous impression given by the hon. Gentleman?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman has been in the House of Commons long enough to know that he should not refer to officials in the Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling on that, Mr. O'Hara. They are, indeed, invisible, but they do exist. It may be possible, by other means, for the Economic Secretary to ascertain that the hon. Gentleman's allegations are factually incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman contradicted what I said about when Treasury officials were able to start work on the document. The Select Committee sat on Wednesday of last week; the official report was published on Thursday; and Treasury officials were instructed to begin preparation of the document on Friday when all the appropriate information could be assembled. I accept that that is a short period of time and I pay tribute to the invisible officials who managed to turn it around in that short space of time.<br><br>
However, the right hon. Gentleman should bear in mind the fact that one of the reasons the Committee was delayed was because the Government were anxious to give the Opposition the opportunity to organise themselves with their new leadership and new Committee structure. It is not a good idea to suggest that we adjourn the Committee because I have to appear at the Council of Ministers in Brussels tomorrow to agree the preliminary draft budget. That is why I sought this debate today. It is important to the scrutiny process that we have a full debate and that questions are asked of me so that I can take the views of members of the Committee to the Council tomorrow.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind members of the Committee, who might be unfamiliar with the procedure of European Standing Committees, that one hour is allowed for questions, which is followed by the debate, and that the sitting must end by 7 o'clock. All the time taken to deal with this point of order on adjourning the Committee comes out of the hour for questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. As a member of the Select Committee on European Legislation, I beg to differ with the views expressed by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. In fact, the delay in setting up the Select Committee was not just a matter of convenience for the Opposition; there was a much deeper reason. Under no circumstances whatsoever were the Government prepared to allow the chairmanship of that Committee to be vested, as it has been since the Committee's inauguration 25 years ago, in the hands of the now Opposition. I happen to be the only Opposition Member who served on that Committee in the previous Parliament who still serves on it. I leave it to people's imaginations as to what the Government thought of the idea of my being Chairman of the Select Committee, but that had some bearing on the question. Therefore, I dispute strongly what the Economic Secretary said.<br><br>
Furthermore, the question of the draft budget is fundamental to the matter of our contributions to the Community. As the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, has just made clear, the increase in our contribution is an absolutely massive 27 per cent. In fact, it might be even more than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is 32 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend says that it is 32 per cent., and I am more than happy to accept what he says. This matter must be considered properly, but that cannot be done under present circumstances. It is impossible for us to reach a measured conclusion. For the reasons that I have given, it is the Government's fault that the Select Committee was not set up in time. Therefore, I lay the responsibility for any pressure that might be exerted on the Economic Secretary in the run-up to tomorrow's Council meeting entirely at the door of the Government. They are at fault; they should bear the consequences. In my view, there is no question but that this Committee should be adjourned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Economic Secretary speaks, I must correct my previous ruling. The guardians at my elbow have advised me that, although the time taken to deal with this point of order comes out of the total two and a half hours allowed for the sitting, there will still be an hour for questions, so the point of order is taking up the time available for the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I realise that the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) might feel some disappointment at not having been selected to chair a Committee in which he has taken a considerable interest during the course of his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0530">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
parliamentary career. However, from speaking to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House, I know that the usual channels and the Committees that meet to agree on such matters have gone to great lengths to try to accommodate the Opposition. Indeed, they sometimes went beyond the call of duty. It is regrettable that the hon. Gentleman is bringing his own pique to this Committee and, thereby, delaying an important debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Totnes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I happen to have the honour and privilege to share the space of the Opposition parties on the Select Committee on European Legislation. I was one of the members of that Committee who, last Wednesday, identified this particular matter as being not only contentious but highly complex and tremendously important to this country's future and its relationship with the European Community—so much so that a Division took place, inspired by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Stone, to determine whether to consider this matter on the Floor of the House. I was advised by the Chairman of the Committee, ably helped by an official who could be seen, that there was no space in the parliamentary timetable for such a debate—forgetting precedent, which I entirely accept is for such matters to be referred to European Standing Committee B. However, this matter is of such significance and importance, as it represents the third increase in Britain's contributions to the European Community, which is an equivalent to 4p on income tax, that I and my hon. Friends insisted that it should be debated on the Floor of the House. I was told that there was no time for such a debate.<br><br>
You may like to know, Mr. O'Hara, that on Monday night the House rose at 7 pm. Three and a half hours were available for debate. It is not right for the Economic Secretary to tell the Committee that she must go to Brussels tomorrow so the matter must be dealt with now; the debate could and should have taken place on Monday night.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I find that argument quite bizarre. To take the last point about the House rising early on Monday night, is it the fault of the Government that the Opposition cannot get their act together sufficiently to scrutinise in the House the important piece of legislation that was being considered on Monday night? Presumably the weather was too good to keep Opposition Members in the Chamber.<br><br>
As for the point about having a debate on the Floor of the House, I have read the report of the Select Committee on European Legislation. Indeed, throughout the period when the Scrutiny Committee was not sitting, I corresponded with its anonymous Chairman to ensure that memoranda would be available to the Committee when it was able to sit. What is more, I was insistent that we find an opportunity to debate in this Committee the complex issues to which hon. Gentlemen have referred.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
I accept that these issues are complex. That is why it took time to draft the explanatory memorandum. I am sure that the Opposition would not want to be furnished with slipshod information. We have already had problems with errors that have slipped into documents because those documents have had to be produced at great speed. I deplore the suggestion that I and the Government have not done everything in our power to try to assist scrutiny of this preliminary draft budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are two ways in which this issue could have been pursued. It could have been pursued by a dilatory motion moved by the Opposition, but it has been pursued through points of order—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chairman is on his feet. The issue has been adequately pursued through points of order, and I now intend to take no more of them. I would have been prepared to accept a dilatory motion if it had been moved earlier; it was not. I now call the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Without in any way challenging your ruling, I feel that we have not yet reached the bottom of this matter. A dilatory motion would have enabled a debate to take place, but many points have not yet been made. I understand that my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) also wanted to intervene, and some of my hon. Friends—members and non-members of the Committee—also wanted to raise points of order, but they have not been able to do so. They too have a right to full and proper information, which has been denied them.<br><br>
Given that I have had only an hour's notice of the documentation, which is central to the debate and which was required and requested by the Select Committee, on which Labour has a majority, and with respect to your suggestion, Mr. O'Hara, a fuller debate would be appropriate so that the Committee could be made fully aware of all Opposition points of view. We are genuinely outraged at the way in which we have been treated by the Government concerning what is an essential matter.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stone referred to an increase of 27 per cent. That figure indeed appears in the Select Committee documentation, but the actual figure is 31·7 per cent. That represents an enormous, colossal increase in the United Kingdom's contribution to the European budget which is not recorded in the Red Book—another point which we have not yet been able to make. The importance of the matter has not been fully appreciated, and the contempt with which the Government have treated the Committee and other hon. Members would become clear if you permitted a dilatory motion and subsequent debate.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Tyrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take no more points of order. I thought it appropriate to allow one more point of order from the right hon. Gentleman who is leading for the Opposition. However, the Opposition have had the opportunity to get themselves into some sort of procedural order, and they could have moved a motion to adjourn sooner than they did. They chose instead to make an extended series of points of order.<br><br>
It is my ruling that the matter has been adequately heard through those points of order, especially as the Committee can sit for only two and a half hours. I shall therefore take no more points of order, nor will I take a motion to adjourn. I now call the Minister to make her opening statement.</span></p>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I am glad to have the opportunity to return to the substance of our debate, because scrutiny by this Standing Committee is important. As a new Minister in a new Government—indeed, this is the first time that I have attended such a Committee as a Member of Parliament—I should like the opportunity to work with all right hon. and hon. Members to try to find ways to improve scrutiny procedures. The complexity of the issues before us, and the fact that the public must be made aware of them, make it important that the fullest scrutiny takes place. Indeed, we have already heard of the Opposition's error of understanding on that matter, but we shall come to that later.<br><br>
It is important for hon. Members to realise that the Budget Council does not make Community policy, nor does it take the big decisions about resource, allocation. Policies are made by the relevant specialist Councils, and the overall financial framework is set by the European Council every few years.<br><br>
Members of the Committee have probably noticed that the Community is just beginning the long haul to the next group of such decisions. That means that the Commission, in setting the preliminary draft budget, and the Budget Council, in adopting its draft budget tomorrow, must work within a relatively tight framework. That was acknowledged by some members of the Committee in previous incarnations. The Budget Council must also remember that its budget decisions can be overturned by the European Parliament.<br><br>
It is nevertheless vital to set the annual budget at the right level, and that it reflects the right priorities. With that in mind, I welcome the fact that the Commission, mindful of the strictures that each state places on its own individual finances, has this year decided to set its preliminary draft budget well below the limit permitted under the financial perspectives that were agreed in Ediburgh by the previous Government. Indeed, the level that has been accepted is unprecedented.<br><br>
It is encouraging that the Commission has singled out agriculture in the budget. I am sure that we shall come back to that subject later, because I and my hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Friends have repeatedly made clear our deep concern about the operation of the common agricultural policy. Indeed, we made a specific election manifesto commitment in that regard.<br><br>
I believe that an increase in commitments of 2.43 per cent. over the level set in the 1997 budget, and the corresponding increase in payments of 2.86 per cent., is still too high and that it asks too much of the national taxpayers who have to foot the bill. At tomorrow's budget meeting, I shall seek to ensure that we contain Community expenditure.<br><br>
It is with regret that I have to draw the Committee's attention to some of the problems in the documentation provided to the Committee. We had an interesting exchange about documentation immediately before I began my statement. Yesterday, I circulated the final piece of documentation, which was a consequence of last week's discussions. It was supplementary to documentation already made available through explanatory memoranda, a pile of which lie before me.<br><br>
I am conscious that the scrutiny process generates a huge amount of paper. That has been the subject of discussion in the past—the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) raised the issue last year. As I said, I am anxious to find a way of controlling the volume of paper so as to make matters comprehensible and to ensure that hon. Members feel comfortable that they are getting the information that they require.<br><br>
I must draw the Committee's attention to some errors in the documentation and apologise profusely for any inconvenience that may have occurred. There is a typing error in the explanatory memorandum that I issued. The figure 4,384 was transposed to 4,834—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke (Cites of London and Westminster)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could we take that at dictation speed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman. I shall slow down and try to moderate my Lanarkshire accent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask members of the Committee to address the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was seeking to address you, Mr. O'Hara. I said, "Could we take it at dictation speed?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do what I can to assit the right hon. Gentleman and also try to speak up a little.<br><br>
The first mistake is an uncorrected typing error in paragraph 39 of the explanatory memorandum. It is a straightforward transposition of 4,384 to 4,834.<br><br>
The second error is more substantive and was spotted when we were reading the documents after last week's debate. It is also paragraph 39—I shall slow down in the hope that hon. Members have found the page. It arose because of the different exchange rates used for 1997.<br><br>
In 1997, the United Kingdom is expecting to be repaid 576 mecu which, in terms of the exchange rate used for the explanatory memorandum, translates to £404 million. However, during 1997, the exchange rate that applies is £1 for 1.35635 ecu, which gives a sterling repayment in 1997 of £425 million. The expected
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0532">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
actual repayment in sterling of £425 million was included in the memorandum and converted to 606 mecu; it should have been converted to 576 mecu at the exchange rate used throughout the explanatory memorandum. I hope that is reasonably clear to the Committee.<br><br>
There are two minor typing errors, which are the consequence of the speed with which the documentation was put together. In line 4 of paragraph 13 of the explanatory note, "£1=35635 ecu" should be replaced by "£1=1.35635 ecu". In line 7 of paragraph 13, £1 equals "1.35636 ecu" should be replaced by £1 equals "1.35635 ecu". I was delighted that hon. Members spotted the error—they have a brilliant career ahead of them as proofreaders. I am sorry that those mistakes occured; I shall ensure than any other typographical errors that are spotted will be corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Will you accept my point of order now? I am new to the House, but I am appalled that we have been unable to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I said that I would take no further points of order on the matter that I think the hon. Gentleman is raising. The Minister has concluded her statement, so we shall now proceed to questions, for which we have until 5.50 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This whole procedure and what the hon. Lady has just said—or failed to say—are further examples of the arrogance with which the Government treat the House. That arrogance can also be witnessed in the Committee proceedings of the Finance Bill, where the third guillotine to be applied in this Session has been used and where legislation is going through with inadequate scrutiny and an accelerated time scale. That that should be applied to domestic legislation is bad enough, but it is now being extended to the scrutiny of the important issue of our contribution to the EC budget.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary has just told us of the errors that are still being discovered in the documents. The date of the Budget Council, which she will attend tomorrow, has been known for months—probably since the end of last year—so there has been plenty of time in which to get the documents in order. However, the Government have failed to do so and are now trying to bounce through the motion by giving us crucial explanatory material at an hour's notice. It is therefore difficult for Opposition Members to ask, and to require the hon. Lady to answer, questions that are at the heart of the debate. We shall endeavour to do so during the alloted hour, but I stress the handicap under which we labour.<br><br>
Will the hon. Lady confirm what she said in her original explanatory note dated 7 July; namely that the 1998 preliminary draft budget proposes a gross UK contribution, after abatement, of £8.3 billion, compared to the 1997 figure of £6.3 billion? That is almost a direct quotation but I have rounded up the figures. I think that we are entitled to assume from that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
that there has been an increase of 32 per cent.—again I have rounded up the figure—in our gross contribution, and all the smoke and mirror effects that are contained in the document, which most of us have not had the chance to read, cannot remove that fact because it is asserted in the hon. Lady's explanatory memorandum. Will that increase be reflected by an increase in our actual cash payments for 1998 or the financial year 1998-99? Will the hon. Lady give us the cash figures for the increase in our contribution? If it is not an increase of 32 per cent., what is it in cash terms? In answering, would she be as simple and plain as she was in her explanatory memorandum?<br><br>
Allied to that question is the fact that the Government have taken over the cash expenditure limits of the previous Government, as published in the Red Book last November, which include our contribution to the European Community. Do those Red Book figures accurately reflect the steep increase in our gross contributions? If I am right and those increases are not reflected in the Red Book, even though the hon. Lady is adhering to the overall cash expenditure ceilings, what other spending categories will she raid in order to fulfil our obligation to the European Union? In other words, what public expenditure cuts will follow from any untoward increase in our net contributions next year?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Mininster replies, I wish to say that the right hon. Gentleman has asked a long and extended portmanteau question which also contains much comment relating to the points of order. We have lost considerable time on points of order, and it would avert unnecessary and lengthy intervention from the Chair if hon. Members on both sides endeavoured to ask one question at a time and were aware that I shall be vigilant in regard to further comments on the original point of order that are disguised as questions. If Members bear that in mind, more time will be available for proper scrutiny in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara. I do not mind portmanteau questions; I spotted three questions in the right hon. Gentleman's contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will we get three answers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to answer the right hon. Gentleman if he does me the courtesy of allowing me to do so.<br><br>
I crave the Committee's indulgence as the answer is long and complicated, but significant. As I am a new Minister, I went to great lengths to prepare myself for the Committee and in so doing read the <i>Hansard</i> report of last year's Committee, when the right hon. Gentleman was standing in my place. It was a revealing experience. I am here today to explain a 3 per cent. increase in commitment; the righ hon. Gentleman boasted last year of his prowess in seeking a 4 per cent. increase in commitment. I can only think that in adapting to the rigours of Opposition, the right hon. Gentleman has perhaps forgotten some aspects of the European budget that he undoubtedly knew much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0533">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
better than I could ever know, but I have gone to great lengths to ensure that I can tell the Committee the proper position.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman asked me about the explanatory memorandum. I am sure that he read it carefully and noted its health warning about the transference of ecu to sterling and sterling to ecu. I should be surprised if he had not noted that warning, because last year he made almost the same point that I am about to make when he said that he would prefer not to discuss changes based on ecu; he wanted to discuss the situation as it related to sterling. His question about increases in expenditure seeks to replay that piece of history in reverse. I shall go through the substance of the right hon. Gentleman's points. He has tabled an amendment for debate later, and I am sure that my hon. Friends will wish to take it up.<br><br>
Now, I am afraid I shall have to go into detail. In the initial report on the 1998 budget, it looks as though there was a 31.8 per cent. increase between 1997 and 1998. Indeed, when I saw that, I immediately asked questions, because on face value it is possible to assume that there has been an alarming increase in the British Government's involvement.<br><br>
I am new to the field and I have to say that I did not find the figures especially transparent, but I am grateful to Treasury officials who have gone to a great deal of trouble to ensure that I understand them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that I am not allowed to accept interventions.<br><br>
In the disputed memorandum that we discussed at the start of the sitting, I referred to the changes that have taken place. There are three direct reasons why the obscure and extremely misleading figure appears. First, there is the effect of exchange rate movements. I shall try to simplify and shorten matters as the explanatory note goes into greater detail. Our contributions to the Community budget are worked out in sterling, which is converted to ecu at a given exchange rate for each year. The ecu-sterling exchange rate moved sharply between 1996 and 1997, so the ecu sums produced by that calculation in respect of 1997 and 1998 differ greatly much more so than the underlying change in sterling terms. Put simply, 100 in respect of the 1997 budget might represent, say, 120 ecu, whereas 100 in respect of the 1998 budget might, say, represent 140 ecu. There is thus an apparent, significant growth in ecu terms, but 100 remains 100. Here, I have to refer to the right hon. Gentleman's words last year about wanting to deal in sterling. That is why I included a health warning in the explanatory memorandum.<br><br>
Secondly, our abatement will be lower in 1998 than it is in 1997, because the amount of the United Kingdom's receipts is expected to be higher in 1997 than in 1996. Fluctuations in the size of the abatement are normal. The right hon. Gentleman made that point during last year's debate. Fluctuations in the size of the abatement are a major contributory factor to the large fluctuations in our gross contibutions after abatement and in our net contributions. The abatement is paid a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
year in arrears and thus relates to circumstances in earlier years. Therefore, a better comparison of growth between two years can be made before the abatement is taken into account. I am sorry that the explanation is so convoluted. Again, I refer hon. Members to the explanatory note.<br><br>
Thirdly, the 1997 supplementary and amending budget incorporated a substantial refund due to the underspending of the 1996 Community budget. As the note states, that also distorts comparison between the two years.<br><br>
If allowances are made for those factors, the underlying rate of increase in the sterling value of the UK gross contirubtion is nowhere near the figure of almost 32 per cent. that the right hon. Member for Wells mentioned. That is why the explanatory memorandum contains a health warning. Based on the underlying sterling estimates for 1997 and 1998, the projected increase is about 2 per cent., which is close to the growth in Community expenditure between the two years, and much as one would expect. The right hon. Gentleman is very excited by the difference but he is not helping me to negotiate a lower settlement for Britain because he obscures proper scrutiny of the budget by emphasising ecu.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman asked about the Chancellor's computations in the Red Book. I cannot believe that someone with the right hon. Gentleman's background could have misunderstood the issue so badly. The sterling increase is likley to be small and well within our expectations. Therefore, the right hon. Gentleman's point was spurious.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman made another point, but I fear that he is trying to confuse the Committee. He, of all people, does not need to be reminded that the revenue side of the EC budget flows automatically by formula. We are not negotiating that in relation to the budget.<br><br>
I apologise for the length of time I have taken on the subject, but I am anxious for members of the Committee to appreciate the substantive point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trust that members of the Committee wil now understand why I suggested that they asked brief, single questions. That would allow for shorter answers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. O'Hara, if, as a new Member with a background in international finance and thus accustomed to clearer documents, I plod in a pedestrian manner towards asking a single question, which has nothing to do with points of order, but is exactly about the point that the Minister did not tackle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman put his question, please?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.<br><br>
Can the Minister explain the specific element that forms the gross national product based contribution? I accept the point in the explanatory memorandum which we have now been offered, that we must examine the figures, especially the GNP-based contribution, in gross terms, and without reference to abatement.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0534">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
If we compare, at gross level, the supplementary and amending budget adjusted figures for 1997 with those for 1998, there appears to be a change of 31.7 per cent. in that contribution. Eight per cent. of that is accounted for by the shift in the formula from VAT to GNP adjusted figures, which are the multipliers. Eighteen per cent. of the remaining 23 per cent. is accounted for in the Treasury note, in a circumlocutory manner, by the so-called need to add back into the 1997 figure the adjustments between the adopted budget and the SAB.<br><br>
If we compare the 1996 outturn for the contribution placed on GNP given in the Brown Book with the 1998 figure, we see a two-year rise that is not infected by the SAB adjustment that the Treasury used to explain 15 percentage points of the 31.7 per cent. increase that appears in the memorandum.<br><br>
The 1996 GNP contribution published in the Brown Book in July this year is £2,489 million. I entirely accept that we should not refer to exchange rates or give figures in ecu, and I do not want the Minister to suggest that I am somehow cooking the books. The 1998 figure, given in the explanatory memorandum and in the other documents—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate that this is a very technical matter, but the hon. Gentleman ought soon to come to his question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am almost there, Mr. O'Hara. The outturn figure for the proposed budget is £4,109 million. That represents a 65 per cent. nominal increase over two years for the GNP-based contribution. During that time the nominal rise should have been about 10 per cent. How does the Minister explain that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because of the air conditioning, Mr. O'Hara, I had difficulty hearing the last sentence of the hon. Gentleman's question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of the Minister, could the air conditioning be turned off? Would the hon. Gentleman repeat the question part of his contribution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly shall. How can the Minister explain the following facts? The figure in the Brown Book for the United Kingdom's GNP-based contribution in 1996 was £2,489 million. The figure in all the documents before us for the preliminary draft budget is £4,109 million. In sterling, that is an nominal increase over two years of 65 per cent. What is the Minister's explanation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to cause discomfort to the Committee by asking for the air conditioning to be turned off, but I found it difficult to hear what was being said. Conservative Members, too, might have had difficulty in hearing what was said. Much of that question has already been answered, although not as lucidly as the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) might want.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
The GNP reserve is a fairly new introduction in the EU budget. It is the residual element of the revenue system. The figure in the Brown Book is a cash figure, which includes a refund in respect of 1995 underspending. The 1998 figures do not include any refund.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. He may not like the answer, but it is accurate—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Has the Minister completed her answer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have obviously not answered to the hon. Gentleman's satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have another opportunity, if necessary, to ask a supplementary question. I call Mr. Coaker.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer to paragraph 24 of the explanatory note and, given that we seem to be arguing about the figures, can the Secretary of State ask tomorrow whether the figures could be detailed in a different way? The headline figure gives a 31 per cent. increase, but that is not a real figure because other matters are associated with it. Are we simply to complain that Britain will be paying 31 per cent. more into the European Union budget, but not have proper discussions about the benefits to be gained from that'? Will there be any scope for my hon. Friend to discuss the figures at the Council of Ministers, so that the public can be properly informed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made an important point; he even promoted me in the process. I am delighted about that and I hope that he tells the Prime Minister. When drafting the explanatory note, we followed the convention of the previous Government. That is why I considered the points made by the right hon. Member for Wells to be so spurious. It was the convention developed by his party when it was in government that has led to such confusion.<br><br>
It will be difficult for me to take my eye off the ball tomorrow because my main priority will be to use any opportunity that arises to reduce even further the increase in the budget. Although I am not happy with the increase in sterling terms, I am delighted to be able to inform the Committee of a lower increase than the right hon. Member for Wells could inform the Committee of on 10 July last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary said that she was not happy with the increase. Will she vote against it tomorrow at the meeting of the Council of Ministers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not vote against the increase. Considerable work has been undertaken to ensure that we reach that level, and it is a tribute to the new Labour Government that, because of our more responsible attitude to the European Union, we are better able to represent Britain's interest. Furthermore, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who has been in office only three months,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0535">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
returned yesterday with a deal that Conservative Members could not secure when they were in government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government's constructive and practical approach to Europe will help her in tomorrow's discussions, unlike the way in which the previous Government dealt with Europe, which resulted in Britain receiving a bad deal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. In the three months since we have been in government, we have found that we can talk more constructively with our European colleagues. We are not isolated in wanting to reduce levels of European spending. Indeed, a couple of weeks ago I discussed with Commissioner Liikanen the need to treat the Community budget with the same rigour and discipline that each member state treats its own budget. It is important to make that point and for us to be able tomorrow, when we gather around the table, to come back with a figure that is even less than that which has been suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the same training in international finance as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset. If I had, I might be able to put my question more simply. If I understood her correctly, the Economic Secretary said that the apparent 31 per cent. increase in the ecu figure of the GNP element was partly distorted by exchange rates, was explained by changes in the United Kingdom's abatement and was partly distorted by the cash refund that we received as a result of the underspend in 1996.<br><br>
Let us consider the matter at the aggregate level before abatement rather than the GNP element. Would it not be proper to consider the 1996 figures after taking account of the underspend that was refunded to the United Kingdom in 1997? We are trying to establish the increase in the United Kingdom's underlying contribution to the European Union. The Treasury's explanations show that the baseline from which the measurements are taken is depressed in 1997 because of that cash refund. Therefore, we should consider, always in sterling, the 1996 figures—outturn minus the 1997 refund.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary will appreciate that, because of the different exchange rates that are used, it is difficult to be perfectly accurate, but the 1996 gross contribution before the abatement, taking into account the 1997 refund, comes to about £8,700 million. The preliminary draft budget proposes an aggregate United Kingdom contribution for 1998 before abatement of £10,188 million. By my calculation, that roughly represents a 17 per cent. increase in sterling terms over two years. Will the Economic Secretary explain that to the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a constructive point, which is well taken. I do not think it appropriate to look at contributions pre-abatement; it makes more sense to look at them after abatement. The abatement is a critical part of the process, and I take this opportunity to say that it is not negotiable.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must give me time to respond to his point. I may not be able to give a yes or no answer, but I am most anxious that the Committee be given proper answers with which it is comfortable.<br><br>
Let us look back at 1994, to give some idea of the scale of the fluctuations that can take place over time. In 1994, the gross contribution after abatement was £5,463 million—or a 0.3 per cent. rise over 1993. In 1995, the gross contribution after abatement was £7,682 million, an increase of 40.6 per cent. I do not know whether Conservative Members asked the Conservative Government about those figures at the time. In 1996, the gross contribution after abatement was £6,721 million—a reudction of 12.5 per cent.<br><br>
I accept that the fluctuations are irritating and I commend to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge the <i>Hansard</i> for European Standing Committee B on 10 July 1996, where he can read what the right hon. Member for Wells said—the right hon. Gentleman gave a much more coherent explanation of the figures than I could give.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McNulty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In any European Union budget process, a key concern is fraud. I do not mean the fraudulent and spurious points made by Conservative Members in—this applies especially to those wearing white suits—an extremely ill-tempered and rude fashion. I hope that the hon. Member for Stone will curtail his temper for the rest of the sitting.<br><br>
May I ask my hon. Friend—at the moment, I cannot remember her title; I know that she is not the Secretary of State—to say what the Government are doing to combat fraud in the EU? Will she comment on what the right hon. Member for Wells did about it when he was a member of the Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend; frankly, I do not mind just being called hon. Friend. He will know that, when we were in opposition, we took fraud extremely seriously. I find it interesting that we have reached this stage of questions without Conservative Members raising the issue.<br><br>
In January 1998, Britain will take over the presidency, and the fight against fraud is one of the key matters that we will pursue. I thank my hon. Friend for referring to the previous Government's performance on fraud. There were many good words, but not many good actions. Indeed, I found it interesting, when perusing last year's <i>Hansard,</i> to discover that my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) tabled an amendment on seeking a more rigorous attitude to fraud, and Conservative Members voted against it. Moreover, because of the posture that Conservative Members adopted on the European Union, they weakened the fight against fraud, especially on the matter of spot checks. At the June 1995—or 1996, perhaps—ECOFIN meeting, the British Government vetoed stronger action against fraud.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
A key point that I must make at tomorrow's meeting is that the British Government will in no way adopt such a relaxed attitude to fraud. We are not in the business of just saying nice things about tackling fraud; we will act. I have already met Commissioners Gradin and Liikanen, both of whom have responsibility for such matters, and we are looking in close detail at fraud and financial irregularity. It is important to the credibility of the EU that we take a strong stand on fraud. In Amsterdam, we, unlike the previous Government, secured qualified majority voting on matters of fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will be interested to know, Mr. O'Hara, that I was just about to deal with fraud, but you called another Member before me.<br><br>
In the legislation brief prepared for last Wednesday's sitting of the Select Comittee on European Legislation, I read that the scale of fraud in the Community budget is horrifying. The questions that have been asked until now test the amount of money that we pay and the increase in that sum. however, the sum we pay and the increase in it have a direct reference to the scale of fraud.<br><br>
As I understand it, we must assume that the total EU budget is estimated on the basis of anticipated fraud. The United Kingdom is a net contributor to the budget—not a receiver from it like the mediterranean countries of Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. As the amount of fraud increases in the net receivers, we, as a net contributor, will go on paying more and more. Is that the right understanding of the situation? Perhaps that explains why there is such an enormous increase in the amount of money that we have to pay. In fact, we are paying for fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is rather sweeping to say that any increase that we are paying this year is paying for fraud. As I have said, I do not take lightly the fight against fraud, but there is another way of looking at the matter: the more frauds we can trace statistically, the more frauds are detected. The detection of fraud must be taken seriously. Having looked through copies of <i>Hansard,</i> I know that my hon. Friends have often raised that as the subject of debate in this Committee.<br><br>
The Community is by no means unique in being vulnerable to fraud against its revenues; national Governments experience that as well. The latest figures are for 1996 and show detected irregularities at 0.7 per cent. of the budget in 1995 and about 0.8 per cent. in 1994. I do not take that lightly, but we must put in place the mechanisms to "fraudproor"—If I can use that expression—the legislation so that the Community is less vulnerable to fraud. That is a key element of the SEM 2000 programme that the Commission has set up; a report on anti-fraud measures was published in June and we keep a close watch on the issue. We are also anxious to ensure that there is co-ordination of anti-fraud enforcement whereby the Commission works closely with member states, organising centralised data bases and exchanges
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
of criminal intelligence; I have spoken to Commissioner Gradin about that because there is a pressing need for better enforcement powers.<br><br>
That need is one of the main reasons why, during the discussions in Amsterdam, we were anxious to see the creation of a specific legal base in the treaty so that the Council could adopt measures against fraud by qualified majority voting. I therefore reassure the hon. Gentleman—because I know that he has pursued the issue on many occasions—that I take a great interest in the subject and that it will repeatedly arise when we take over the presidency of the Commission next year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have every confidence that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will get the best deal possible for Britain in the budget negotiations. I applaud her statement that the UK abatement is not up for negotiation and that she will fully defend that position; that is reassuring. However, we must dispose of the argument that we have suffered or are being threatened with a substantial increase in our budget contributions, either in itself or compared with other EU nations. I understand from my hon. Friend that the figure of 32 per cent. decreases to 2.43 per cent. in sterling terms; the larger figure is almost entirely accounted for by the substantial appreciation in sterling. If one applies an EU deflator to the figure of 9 per cent. and deflates the UK figure, does not our contribution compare reasonably with other EU nations? Even if there is a problem with our making too high a contribution, is not the real problem the fact that the overall budget is too high?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who was obviously listening more closely to my opening remarks than were Opposition Members. I get the impression that they were trying hard to ignore the facts, which surprises me because I had always assumed that the right hon. Member for Wells set great store by intellectual rigour in such matters. I said in my introductory remarks that I deplored the increase of 2.43 per cent. over the level set in 1997 and a corresponding increase in payments of 2.86 per cent.; that is better than the situation we had last year, but it is still not good enough. We must prosecute our case vigorously as possible tomorrow and I hope that my and my officials' negotiating skills will be up to the task.<br><br>
On my hon. Friend's point about contributions across the board, we are not the only country that is a net contributor; a substantial number of countries are now net contributors and they are our natural allies on the issue. This Government's sensible attitude to the EU helps us in prosecuting Britain's interests because other countries are not frightened of showing that they are Britain's allies; that is a most helpful basis for negotiations. I hope that I have answered my hon. Friend's point; if I have not, I shall return to it in my winding-up speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that when, long ago, I did her job and went to the Court of Auditors on the issue of fraud, I was told that I was the first Budget Council Minister within living memory to have visited the Court of Auditors? I commend my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0537">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
example to the hon. Lady as there is much to be learned from seeing the Court of Auditors on the ground.<br><br>
Would you allow me to treat that question as rhetorical, Mr. O'Hara? Does the Minister accept also that the Opposition recognise that our work of scrutiny is important? Without commenting on the past or on the circumstances of this particular meeting, it seems to me that we would do a better job of scrutiny if hon. Members had the opportunity of a teach-in before the Committee meets. The facts could be agreed then rather than debating them in Committee, which wastes time that could otherwise be given to proper debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As always, the right hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I met a representative of the European Court of Auditors last Friday—I think in this Room, because I was also debating the Finance Bill in another Committee Room. I am conscious of the work done by the European Court of Auditors. I realise that although it has to be independent, it must be given the full support of the member states.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the right hon. Gentleman. In all the discussions that I undertook while attempting to brief myself in European matters, his name was mentioned with significant consistency as being someone who conducted himself superbly in the councils of Europe. I have much to learn from his example in guiding discussions and from the way in which he related to other members. I am glad to pay that tribute to the right hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
My officials have planned that I should visit the European Court of Auditors in December. I look forward to that, especially now that enlargement is part of the European debate, because it is important that the views of the European Court of Auditors are taken into account and that we are seen more visibly to be giving it the maximum support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for West Dorset, I am a new Member. He has a background in international finance; I have a background in international business. I have found much of the debate alienating because of its exclusive focus on contributions, with no question of whether we receive value for money. I note from the report that one of the reasons for the lower rebate this year is the substantial increase in expected receipts from the European Community this year. What is the background to those receipts? Why is there an increase, and can we expect it to continue? I should also like to ask my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. One question at a time, please.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I take the opportunity now to say that I missed out one point made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) about the scrutiny process. He spoke a lot of sense. Indeed, the need for better mechanisms to ensure proper scrutiny was made clear at the beginning of this sitting. It is in no one's interests for us to have truncated discussions;
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
whenever one sees a pile of paper that high, there is little opportunity to scrutinise it properly without the advice of officials.<br><br>
The level of receipts fluctuates for a wide variety of reasons. For example, receipts will be affected as the structural fund programmes get under way; and, of course, compensation for BSE will also affect receipts. That is why there are troughs and peaks in receipt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask again what I believed to be a fairly simple question. I fear that the previous answer must have been unintentionally misleading. The figure in the budget for fourth resource contributions is about 65 per cent. higher than the figure for 1996, even after allowing for the adjustments referred to by the Minister.<br><br>
I say that the Economic Secretary's answer must have been unintentionally misleading because the adjustment in 1996 in the Brown Book is £4 million. That explains almost none of the 65 per cent. The Economic Secretary has still to explain 64-9 per cent. of that difference. Will she please do so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had responded to the hon. Gentleman. I am conscious that a large number of hon. Members have risen but have not had the opportunity to ask a question. I want to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman. If there is time, in my winding-up speech I will go into some detail; if not, I undertake to write to him. Obviously, I have not been as clear as the hon. Gentleman would like, but I do not want to take up the Committee's time on a statistical debate when other hon. Members have not yet had a chance to ask a question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a new member of the Committee, it is clear to me that much of the confusion arises from the format of the budget and the fact that variance is not presented in sterling. However, I must say that, given all the previous government experience on the Opposition Benches, I am astonished that that fact has not yet been mentioned; that speaks volumes.<br><br>
What is more significant is that our whole debate has been about the total spend, and not about what money is being spent on. Can my hon. Friend confirm that the movement away from the CAP in favour of trans-European networks, the wider structural funds and the educational programmes for young people is what the House has been calling for for a long time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent point. It is interesting that it is a Labour member of the Committee who has raised the issue of agriculture. Both in opposition and government, we have made it clear that we are unhappy about the level of spending on agriculture, and a priority for the Government will be to seek renegotiation of the common agricultural policy.<br><br>
My hon. Friend referred to projects to general employment. He will be aware of the statements made by my right hon. Friends the Chancellor and the Prime Minister about getting Europe to work. The jobs initiative will be an important task for the Government during our presidency. We have already been involved
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0538">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
in discussions, not just at senior level but at my level, about how we ensure that we get more young people into work.<br><br>
There are a number of useful programmes to generate employment, not least of which are those concerned with seeking reconciliation in Northern Ireland, where many people realise that there is a significant socio-economic reason, as well as a deep cultural reason, for some of the problems. I will raise the subject tomorrow at the Budget Council. I have already spoken to members of a Commission and to Members of the European Parliament about the importance which the British Government attach to such programmes, not just in Northern Ireland but across the board.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is right to direct our attention towards the detail of how European resources are being spent. We must ensure that the priorities of European spending match our Government's priorities, which include getting people back to work. My hon. Friend mentioned the increased money that will be made available for trans-European networks and for research; those are crucial matters that we will be negotiating tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady referred to the importance that she attaches to anti-fraud measures, and said that she has already discussed them with the European institutions. May I draw her attention to page 18 of volume 0 of the document before the Committee and to budget line B5-9, which brings together all anti-fraud expenditure, and which, sadly, shows that there will be a reduction of 15.5 mecu? Does the Economic Secretary accept that reduction, and will she raise that issue tomorrow at the Budget Council? Why has her evident interest in antifraud measures apparently not borne fruit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may pay a compliment to the right hon. Gentleman, while I was considering that aspect of the budget, I had in mind his contribution and that of a former Member of the House, Mr. Phillip Oppenheim.<br><br>
Anti-fraud measures receive relatively small provision in the Community budget, as the right hon. Gentleman knows—I am surprised that someone of his distinction is asking that question. He knows that the relatively small amount that is being spent on antifraud measures is because much of the pursuit of fraud has to be done by member states. Given the view that the right hon. Gentleman takes on Europe, I am sure that he would be the first to acknowledge that there is a real need for member states to get their act together on the pursuit of fraud.<br><br>
We believe that the relatively small provision is adequate to cover the specific Community-financed measures in question, and it is consistent with the overall increased activity against fraud. Most of that activity is carried out by authorities in member states, in line with their responsibilities, and without Community financing. The measure does not take account of increases in anti-fraud spending under structural and external actions. However, knowing the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
right hon. Gentleman's views, I am sure that he will agree that the pursuit of fraud should rightly be undertaken by the appropriate authorities in member states.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have now come to the end of the hour allotted to questions, so I shall be asking the Minister to move the motion. Before doing so, however, I should inform the Committee that I have selected an amendment in the name of the right hon. Member for Wells.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
<p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. COM(97)280, the Preliminary Draft Budget of the European Communities for 1998; and supports the Government's efforts to maintain budget discipline in the Community.—[<i>Mrs. Liddell.</i>]</p>
<p>5.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the motion, to leave out from 'Committee' to end and add
<br><blockquote><p>'objects to European Community Document No. COM(97)280, the Preliminary Draft Budget of the European Communities for 1998; takes the greatest exception to the proposed increase of 27 per cent. in the United Kingdom's contribution to the Budget, calls on Her Majesty's Government to qualify its approval of the Budget; notes that the Commissions eighth annual report on the protection of the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud reveals an appalling increase in fraud in the Community; and urges drastic action to reduce it.</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief in order to give other hon. Members the opportunity to contribute, but I must start by observing that the Economic Secretary has still offered no apology for the way in which she has treated members of the Committee by the very late and inaccurate documentation given to us. A number of errors have been corrected, but we have still had no proper explanation for the fact that many hon. Members received vital documents only this morning.<br><br>
The hon. Lady alluded several times to my time in office in her post, and as we did, indeed, tackle the same problems. We all do our best to counter fraud and so on, but I always tried to treat my opposite number with the respect that I felt towards her—the post was then held by the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo). If important documentation was available only on the day of the debate, I always ensured that she was sent a copy—but I have still received no copy of late documents.<br><br>
I know that the Treasury normally fulfills those usual courtesies on its own. The relevant section in the Treasury would always include Opposition spokesmen in the distribution of late papers. The fact that that was not done in this case, without explanation or apology, can only mean that it has been blocked by a Minister. Perhaps an apology in the spirit of humility that one might expect is too much to ask for, but a fuller explanation would be welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it an astounding suggestion that I would try to stop the right hon. Gentleman receiving a document. Given that he has betrayed his lack of understanding on the ecu versus sterling rates in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0539">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Community budget, I cannot see why I would be frightened to make documentation available to him. Obviously there is nothing that the Government need fear from him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the absense of an explanation, I draw my own conclusion. I know from my two years in the Treasury that it would have been the normal workings of officialdom to let members of the Committee, including Opposition spokesmen, know of any late data and documentation. I cannot believe that the workings of the Treasury could alter so dramatically in the two or three months since the new Government have been in office. I can only conclude that there has been a change in ministerial habits. After all, officials are accountable to Ministers who, in turn, are accountable to Parliament for the operation of their Departments. If that is an incorrect explanation and the hon. Lady has another one, I should be glad to hear it. I accept that it is too much to ask for a spirit of humility from the new Government, so in the absence of an apology, I shall proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I crave the benefit of your experience. I know that officials in the House are meant to be invisible. but the right hon. Gentleman is suggesting that there has been an outrageous misuse of official status. The matter was handled in a considerable rush. We have tried to be as helpful as possible; for the right hon. Gentleman to suggest that officials have been used by the Government in some way means that the position of those officials is being undermined, which is an extremely serious allegation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is a point of order for me. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is not a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. It is simply a matter of courtesy. That is all we are discussing. When I did the hon. Lady's job, I tried to treat the Opposition with a modicum of courtesy which extended to trying to ensure that they were adequately briefed with late submissions—I think that that is a rather unexceptional remark. It did not happen in this case, but it used to be the working practice of the Treasury. The fact that copies of the document were sent to Members of the Committee—however belatedly—but not to Opposition spokesmen may have been an oversight, but in the absence of an explanation, I can only assume that something has happened. As Ministers are responsible for the actions of their officials, it behoves the hon. Lady either to give us an explanation or, perhaps, an apology. I know that apologies do not come easily from the hon. Lady, so I shall let that pass and get on to the substance of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I clearly heard the Opposition spokesman impugning the reputation of officials. The right hon. Gentleman should apologise or withdraw his comments.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not a point of order for me. The matter has now been raised twice as a point of order, but it is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the highest regard for British civil servants; I worked with them and I think that they take a great deal of unfair criticism. We have the finest civil service in the world.<br><br>
My remarks on this issue are rather different. All that I am seeking is an explanation—from the Minister, as it is constitutionally incorrect for me to seek it from officials—as to why the Committee, including the hon. Member for South Thanet, (Dr. Ladyman) has been so dramatically underbriefed about such an important matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had given an explanation at the beginnning of points of order. I shall happily go over it again, but I do not want to waste the Committee's time. If the right hon. Gentleman wants me to say sorry so that we can get on with scrutinising the European budget, I am happy to do so. Sorry—can we now please get on with scrutinising the budget, which the taxpayer expects us to do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an apology not to me but to the Committee and this institution. We hear a lot from the Government about accountability, openness and people's right to know. We are even being promised a right-to-know Bill, but we could start with a right to know in this Committee, with timely and accurate information, given in the spirit of openness. We have finally dragged out of the hon. Lady that it is all the result of some oversight, but I shall now get on to the substance of the matter.<br><br>
The hon. Lady denied that there is a 32 per cent. increase in our gross contributions to the European Community budget. She has given an explanation in writing, augmented by some of her remarks. But she has not given a true, simple figure for what she anticipates will be our contributions next year as against this year. She has given plenty of figures showing how the overall EC budget will go up next year, but that is a completely different subject. We want to know the anticipated figure for the increase—the actual cash increase—in United Kingdom gross contributions, net of abatement. We also want to know—I realise that this a more difficult question—whether our net contributions will increase, after receipts, between this year and next.<br><br>
The reason for raising the matter is simple. The Economic Secretary has not answered my question concerning the Red Book. We all know that the Government have taken over the Red Book expenditure targets laid down in his last Budget in November by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). Those targets remain the anticipated expenditure projections of the present Government.<br><br>
On page 123 of the Red Book, we find projections for our contributions to the EC budgets. My question is simple: do those figures still accurately describe the increase that the Economic Secretary now expects? If the hon. Lady expects a bigger increase, as I believe she
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0540">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
may, where will she find the cash for the higher contributions? Given the rigid cash control inherited from the previous Government, it must arithmetically be the case that that cash will have to come from some other spending commitment. It is a simple question. I should be grateful for some elucidation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the inevitable impact on public expenditure plans, the consequent unemployment and, of course, the effects on public services, does my right hon. Friend accept that it is pretty remarkable that the Minister should be reluctant to take action in the Council of Ministers meeting tomorrow to deal with that question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary has signalled in advance that in no circumstances will she vote against the conclusions tomorrow—whatever the eventuality, whatever matters are raised, and whatever increases may be proposed. It is extraordinary to signal one's intentions in advance. That is not a particularly good way to stand up for British interests; I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash).<br><br>
The other oddity is that the budget figures and their possible impact on national finances have already been discussed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the ECOFIN meeting on 7 July. The Chancellor's written answer, given after that meeting, states that the Council did indeed formally discuss the EC budget for 1998, so there is nothing new about those figures. Many of the facts and figures available to that meeting are to be found in that huge pile of documents, which makes it all the more surprising that the Committee could not have been given a more accurate explanation. Also, if there was something of significance in those figures, particularly as regards the British contribution, the Chancellor was silent on it, not only at the meeting but in his subsequent report to the House.<br><br>
Lastly, I come to the serious question of fraud. We are talking about public money. Our net contributions to the European Community budget are approximately £8 million a day. That figure fluctuates, but the difference between what we pay in, net of the abatement, and what we get back from agricultural and structural funds, is about £8 million every single day. That is a significant sum of public money, considering that all other expenditure headings are under pressure.<br><br>
It is very much in our interests to ensure that none of that money is fraudulently applied. It is odd that the Chancellor apparently made no reference at the ECOFIN meeting to the importance of anti-fraud measures. If they are a priority, it is surprising that the right hon. Gentleman did not discuss them. His written answer, too, was silent on the matter. Whenever my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe attended ECOFIN meetings, he persistently raised the question of fraud and mismanagement. Such questioning seems to have stopped.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
As to expenditure, the hon. Lady rightly said that much of the fraud takes place in member states and so is in some respects outside the control of Community institutions. I believe that if there is a fraudulent mess, the response should be to turn off the tap in Brussels and stop adding to it. That is a Community responsibility, but there seems to be a reluctance to act and the expenditure continues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What a wonderful array. I do not want to take up too much time, but I give way to the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a short question. The right hon. Gentleman rightly stresses fraud, so why did the previous Government vote against the proposed measures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We did not inhibit or prevent any anti-fraud measures—that is quite untrue. The hon. Gentleman may have at the back of his mind the fact that we are reluctant to extend majority voting to this area but, in my experience—admittedly, it was only two years—no anti-fraud measure was vetoed. It is not the case that the entire anti-fraud programme would have been accelerated or aided by majority voting, although I cannot necessarily generalise from my experience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman enlighten the committee? He mentioned that the former Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe, raised the issue of fraud on many occasions at European meetings, but will he say what the previous Government actually did to improve the situation and how successful they were?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From fighting a lonely battle in the early years, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe managed to push the issue higher up the European agenda. At the start, we were almost alone but, by the end, the northern block—the Germans, the Scandinavians and, on occasions, the Benelux countries and France—took the issue seriously.<br><br>
A number of important institutional reforms were made, about which I could make rather a long speech. I know that it falls outside the subject under consideration today but, to take one example, we ensured that the European Court of Auditors was made a full, operating institution of the European Community. Previously, the court's observations were normally looked at, smiled on, filed away and forgotten. We ensured that member states had to respond to its reports, observations and criticisms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I will not give way again.<br><br>
Our achievements were considerable, which makes it all the odder that the hon. Lady is authorising and excusing the apparent cut in expenditure. The EU has an annual budget of about £57 billion, and the hon. Lady pointed out that much of that is spent in member

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
states. However, about 20 per cent. is under the direct control of the Commission and other European Community institutions; if my mathematics is correct, that is about £12 billion. That makes it all the more alarming that expenditure on combating fraud will, according to page 18 of volume 0, be reduced from 19.9 mecu to 4.4 mecu. That is a staggering cut in anti-fraud expenditure, which is already tiny in comparison with the £12 billion that the Community institutions are spending.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way again. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will catch your eye, Mr. O'Hara, so that he can make his own contribution.<br><br>
We know from past experience that the Community institutions are riddled with waste and mismanagement, so to cut anti-fraud expenditure from 19.9 mecu to 4.4 mecu is the height of irresponsibility, and I am surprised that the hon. Lady should sanction it. I hope that she raises the matter tomorrow, and insists that the cut be reversed. She says that she discussed it—was it with the Court of Auditors or with the Commission? She says that she regards anti-fraud expenditure as important; she cannot possibly sanction its decimation.<br><br>
I would still like answers to those questions from the Economic Secretary. I genuinely accept the apology that she has offered about the documents; we do not need to trail over that again. However, we need some answers on the substantive and more important issue of the European Community finance burden that the Government face.</span></p>
<p>6.10 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary well in her discussions on the budget tomorrow. I would like to flag two or three matters that I hope she will address in those dicussions. However, I would first like to make a brief observation about the crocodile tears that we have seen from Opposition members of the Committee about the increases in the budget.<br><br>
My hon. Friend mentioned the 3 per cent. increase in payment appropriations. Between 1993 and 1998, commitment appropriations increased by no less than 27 becu; during the same period, payment appropriations increased by no less than 25 becu—those figures are at current prices. Before Conservative Members start jumping up and down to try to confuse those figures with the concerns that they expressed earlier, I should say that the vast majority of those increases took place between 1993 and 1997, when the Conservatives were in charge of the negotiations.<br><br>
When Conservative Members are baying for my hon. Friend to reject the budget at the disucssions tomorrow, it is salutary to reflect that, as I am sure she will confirm in her reply, there is a payment appropriation in the budget for next year of 1.3 becu, which is the cost of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis. I am sure that my hon. Friend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
will also want to confirm that between 1996 and 1998—a period covering three budgets, including this one—the BSE crisis has cost no less than 5 becu. The hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) may want to perform a sterling conversion on that figure, but even he will agree that it is a substantial amount.<br><br>
The reason why that item is in the budget and we must contribute to it—although we get a lot back from it—is that mistakes were made by the Conservative party when it was in government. Perhaps Conservative members who ask us to reject the budget will want to tell the farmers who are still suffering from the BSE crisis that they will not get any money next year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the budget proposes a 911 mecu cut in support payments for beef? What will he tell his farmers about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have any farmers in my constituency, but I have many constituents who are concerned about the CAP because they like to eat. My constituents are still paying through the nose because of the previous Government's ineffectual attempts to reform the CAP.<br><br>
It is true that there is a reduction of 900 mecu in the cost of BSE measures, but that reduction is made from a total of 2.5 becu—a substantial figure. That is an interesting point for my hon. Friend the Minister to consider.<br><br>
In the light of those figures, which are all contained in the documents, may I suggest two conclusions? First, the previous Government's approach to the European Community budget has failed. Secondly, the financial perspective has proved to be ineffective, and it is now regarded as a target rather than a measure of control. I have lost count of how many times the financial perspective is refered to in the document. It is important, but it was set up to control expenditure and I suspect that it is being used as a target, a point that I hope my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will consider. We need as tight a budgetary regime as necessary and an urgent review of the financial perspective.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend also consider the possibility of removing what many of us consider to be an unsustainable distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure in the budget? I accept that such issues are long term, but it is important that they are taken on board.<br><br>
I want to cite a couple of examples of how I believe the Commission, when presenting its budget, is guilty of creative accounting to a greater or lesser degree. The same happened when the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) was responsible for such matters. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary is aware of the pitfalls, one of which is agriculture expenditure. That is a direct result of the financial sleight of hand that was perpetrated and agreed to by the previous Government.<br><br>
The documents explain that arable payments for cereals will decrease by 1.3 billion ecu, but actual expenditure will increase by 300 million ecu. That is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0542">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
because the deferred payment on the oilseed regime that the previous Government agreed to last year will now have to be paid for this year. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be careful, when studying the agricultural section of the budget, to try to resist as far as possible falling into the same trap as the previous Government and deferring expenditure to future years.<br><br>
In 1992, we were told by the then Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), that the CAP reforms would be good for the consumer, good for the taxpayer and good for the farmer. Since those immortal words were uttered, the CAP budget has increased by no less that 40 per cent. Even taking enlargement into account, such massive increases are bad for the taxpayer, bad for the consumer and bad for the farmer. I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will take my points on board, and I wish her well in the negotiations tomorrow.</span></p>
<p>6.17 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has become clear during the debate that, for all her well-known and formidable intelligence and skills, the Economic Secretary does not understand what is happening in the budget. More importantly, she does not understand what is happening to the whole country which will have to pay the taxes to meet the contributions.<br><br>
From 1994 to 1997, the contributions, in sterling terms, were contained to an increase throughout the whole four years of about 11 per cent. in nominal terms, without paying attention to abatements. In fact, the figure is roughly the same with or without abatement. On a rolling average basis, there has been a vast increase. No amount of obfuscation will obscure that—it will come home to roost in that taxpayers in this country will have to pay more. It would be better if the Economic Secretary faced up to that and spent her time trying to work out what to do about the problem rather than trying to circumvent genuinely meant questions.<br><br>
As a new Member, this is the first time that I have been assaulted by a pile of papers such as that before us. I would that it were the last time, although I fear that our Whips might force repeated attendances at this Committee in the coming years.<br><br>
I have had the privilege of seeing that pile of paper for approximately 72 hours. I have spent the better part of 12 hours going through it. I have had two research assistants spend 48 hours between them go through it. I have made several telephone calls to the Department of Trade and Industry and to the Commission. I did all that because I was absolutely unable to understand the so-called budget.<br><br>
A budget, as I understand it, is an item which explains what will be spent in total and roughly on what it will be spent. One does not have to be a genius to have that conception of a budget. Whatever the document before the Committee is, it is not that. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
contains innumerable permutations of descriptions of where the money will go. There are chapters, there are objectives—incidentally, a crib not contained anywhere in that pile of documents is needed to understand what the objectives are—but there is no reference to a single positive item, such as a bridge, a tunnel, a school or a hospital. I thought that we need not worry ourselves about that because the experts can deal with it.<br><br>
I, too, have spent time in this country's bureaucracy. I have, like my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, developed a considerable, healthy respect for this country's civil service. So when I telephoned the DTI about a modest inquiry restricted to the European regional development fund, I expected that I would be rewarded with a clear analysis of the various objects on which that largish fund—it is about the size of the total gross national product of a moderately sized African country—was being spent. The DTI informed me that it has no such central information. It does not know on what that largish sum—roughly speaking, enough to rebuild all the hospitals in Britain several times over—was being spent. I was told that the regional offices had some idea, but the DTI was unsure as to which people in which regional offices would know.<br><br>
I thought that even that was not a problem. After all, this is a budget of the Community and, therefore, the Commission surely contains someone who keeps an adequate register at least of what that one fund within the budget is being spent on. No such luck. I spent three hours on the telephone partly speaking to a Frenchman, who was extremely learned in many subjects, and partly to an Englishman. After linguistic problems with the Frenchman, caused by my poor French, I resorted to speaking to a more lowly placed Englishman. However, I believe that the net result of my investigation would be replicated by anyone, even if the inquiry were made over a longer time scale. There is no central register of what the money is being spent on. Not only does the document before us contain no information on it, but no such information exists.<br><br>
We are told that at tomorrow's meeting the Economic Secretary is to "negotiate"—I use the word ironically because we have been told that she will not vote against the proposal, come what may. I have not the faintest idea how she can negotiate something that she will not vote against, come what may. Nevertheless, she will go and do this thing called negotiating. Unless she has access to information that I was unable to glean from various sources—if she has such information, it would be good to know why it has not been revealed to this Committee and the House—she will negotiate the budget without having knowledge of what it is about. She will not know whether it is the right amount of money or the wrong amount of money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that the basis of the budget and the mechanisms that developed it were all agreed during the previous Administration in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give notice, which I am sure my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells would echo, that the Conservative party in opposition now has a certain clarity on this subject and will be pursuing it with vigour, I hope, on the basis of co-operation between the parties. Labour Members might have noticed that there was a certain amount of argument about such matters in the Conservative party. That argument has been resolved in favour of the people of this country. [<i>Laughter.</i>] Labour Members should take the matter seriously because over the next five years we shall pursue with foresight and clarity and under the guidance of people such as my hon. Friend—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stone?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. We shall pursue the question that I am addressing: on what is all that money being spent? It was clear from her answers that the Economic Secretary will go to the Budget Council meeting without understanding why our contribution has risen or what is in the budget—no mortal could understand that—and having promised herself, the Committee and the House that she will not, come what may, vote against the budget. That seems an extraordinarily bad basis for conducting any kind of relationship in government—foreign or otherwise, within the EC or domestically. Rather than merely informing the Committee earlier and better, the Economic Secretary and the Government as a whole would do better to inform themselves earlier and better about the matters under discussion.</span></p>
<p>6.25 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished by the attitude of Opposition Members, particularly in regard to the hon. Member for Stone; under the previous Government, he was treated as someone who had a case of a contagious and exotic plague, but now he is being treated as a good egg, a sort of unguided missile that they are happy to let fly because they no longer care where it lands. However, now that they have enunciated their policy on Europe, I understand where they got that attitude from. I also find it strange that the Opposition seem unable to accept the Minister's simple explanation that the figures have been distorted because the pound has increased in strength.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman ought not resort to that argument. If he refers to the record of our proceedings he will see that all our questions were based on the pound sterling; during the two hours that we have now spent discussing the document, we have not made a single reference to the ecu because we realise that we should focus on the pound. All the questions that I and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells asked were based on the sterling figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I reject that; the right hon. Member for Wells repeatedly based his arguments on the figure of 32 per cent., which is distorted by the change in the exchange rate.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What we are saying is that if the figure of 32 per cent. is now misleading and erroneous, despite the statements in the explanatory memorandum, we should be given the sterling figures for the actual cash increase in expenditure. That is the modest request that we keep making, but we have not received an answer to our question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is my understanding that the answer has been given to the right hon. Gentleman and that the Economic Secretary has said that even if she does not have time to give it again in sufficient detail in her winding-up speech, she will contact him at a later date to do so. I do not understand why the right hon. Gentleman is flogging that dead horse.<br><br>
My substantive point is on a subject that has not yet been addressed, namely the work on sound financial management systems and the progress on implementing them. I have sympathy with some of the points made by Opposition Members. Before being elected to the House I was a finance chairman on my local council. I would not have lasted five minutes if I had presented my members with anything as complex as the documents that are before the Committee. An analogous situation would be if a couple of dozen Members of Parliament were put in a coach, taken to a new nuclear power station and told to spend a few hours looking around so that they could state their views on the physics, design and workmanship before the power station was switched on—if would not be entirely surprising if the place then blew up. The EC budget is somewhat more complicated than nuclear power stations—I speak as a radiation biologist who knows how they work.<br><br>
We shall never get to the bottom of how the system works and where the money goes if we rely on the existing management principles and systems, which would have been improved had the previous Government offered a little more co-operation and a little less obstruction during their time in office. I appeal to the Minister not to lose sight of the need for reform, in regard not only to fraud, but the financial management systems. If such reformed systems were in place, Opposition Members would have the information and control systems that they are crying out for—although it is their own fault that they do not have them. I hope that the Labour Government will ensure that such systems are put in place during their term of office.</span></p>
<p>6.29 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable <span class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a broad sense, I intend to support the Government, and I wish the Economic Secretary well. That stems from the Liberal Democrats' belief that, generally, the European Union gives good value for money.<br><br>
I am a little less happy about the process that we have followed this afternoon. As to scrutiny, the documents reached me even later than they did the shadow Chief Secretary. I appreciate that the Liberal Democrats' Whips Office comes later in the milk run and I do not want too much of it; I am sure that no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0544">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
discourtesy was intended and that there is no conspiracy. However, the scrutiny process has not been as effective as it might have been.<br><br>
Echoing the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), as a new Member I have been grappling with the mystification of the whole process. It would have been helpful if, over the years, some of the concepts had been clarified, as we are left with a certain amount of fog. I have been trying to get clear in my own mind some of the key figures that we should carry around and some commonsense interpretations. I may have missed a purple passage of clarity in the 10 minutes that I was out of the Room, but I doubt it.<br><br>
I am groping for three figures. First, I want to know the British share of the budget next year and how it has changed net of abatement. Table 6 shows that it has increased substantially in ecu terms, but that is a result of the currency effect. We need to nail down that figure so that we get a sense of the relative share of the burden.<br><br>
Secondly, as the right hon. Member for Wells said several times, it would be helpful if we had a clear picture of the real increase in payment—not just net of abatement, but taking inflation into account—in the currency that is used in the transaction. I do not have that figure in my mind.<br><br>
Thirdly, I echo the shadow Chief Secretary's question about the Red Book—how the numbers and budget projections are translated into overall public expenditure commitments and what that means for the budget as a whole. That is not simply a Conservative point; it is a concern that we all share, and we have not yet had a totally clear answer to it.<br><br>
What many of us have been grappling with is the exchange rate effect. Much of the problem stems from the fact that the United Kingdom is the only major member of the European Union that has a floating exchange rate. Sterling has floated in an extremely volatile way, unlike the wide-band—let alone the narrow-band—currencies. Billions of ecus or pounds are affected by the choice of two days in the year, as I understand the memorandum. This may be a methodological rather than a substantive point but, during discussions on the matter, we should find a better numéraire—a floating average over three years, for example—to prevent the flow of funds, or their presentation, from reflecting the idiosyncrasies that stem from sterling's volatility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Page 93 of volume 0 shows the reduction in the allocation of aid for developing countries in southern Africa from 97 mecu to 90 mecu. That is a substantial cut, which is being used to pay for increased expenditure in the Mediterranean area.<br><br>
The matter was raised by the Select Committee, and I believe that Britain should be fighting the reduction. There is a tendency to feel that now Mr. Mandela has come to power everything is fine, but I believe that that view is mistaken. We should support the moderate and progressive Governments in southern Africa, to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
ensure that they are successful and not replaced by less moderate Governments who might cost us a great deal more in the long run.</span></p>
<p>6.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Tyrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing what I believe to be one of the great European scandals of our time; several Labour Members have intimated that they have some sympathy with that view. S The subject comes hot on the heels of something that is scarcely less scandalous—namely, that the Committee does not have the information that it needs to make a balanced assessment of the budget.<br><br>
I wish to refer to fraud. It is not only the Economic Secretary and one or two others who have said that fraud is a central issue under the new Government. When he was shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"not enough work is done in the Community to combat fraud".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 November 1994: Vol. 250, c. 952.]</p></blockquote>
He has also made similar statements, which I shall not repeat to the Committee. Yet the Government are going to Brussels to vote for a budget, in which the main budget line for fraud is being cut by 78 per cent., as set out on page 13 of the documentation.<br><br>
The Minister said that the figure is much smaller than that, because some of those so-called cuts appear in other budget lines or have been reallocated. What is the real cut in the budget on fraud compared with last year's figures? It is hard to believe that a 78 per cent. cut can disappear completely in the reallocation of accounts. What will the Government do about it?<br><br>
My second point concerns the negative reserve. It was referred to before, but I do not consider that we received an adequate response. One of the few intelligent axioms of the European Community budget is that the European Community cannot borrow. In recent years, however, a pernicious notion—the negative reserve—has appeared in the accounts, effectively enabling the Community to borrow, and that reserve appears to be growing. What is the Government's position on that, and how firmly and strongly, if at all, will they combat its existence in the European budget's accounts?<br><br>
My third point concerns what has really happened in sterling terms and is a variation of the matter that has been delaying and troubling the Committee throughout its proceedings. What should the Red Book have shown for the forward-year projections? To what extent will those projections for the European net contributions alter as a result of the budget? There was a clear budget line for the European Community in the last Budget presented by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe, but there was no such line in the Red Book that was published with the Budget a few weeks ago. When did Treasury Ministers become aware of the European Community budget? Was it before or after the Budget? If it was before, why was not some reference made in the Red Book to the substantial increase?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0545">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
I am sure that we now know that a vote had to take place in the Select Committee on European Legislation to keep the issue off the Floor of the House. I am clear that the more such issues are subjected to scrutiny, the more likely is it that there will be widespread and popular discontent about the budget. In our first few weeks under a Labour Government, we are learing that what has been described as a new spirit of co-operation with Community partners is looking all too much like capitulation, whereby we just write the cheques.</span></p>
<p>6.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the game was given away in one of the final phrases that the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) used. If I remember correctly, he said that he hoped that, because of this debate, more and more concern about the European Union would arise within the country. That is the Opposition's real agenda.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My concern is purely to ensure that the wider public come to understand the documents before us, which, frankly, are completely incomprehensible, even, if I may say so, to someone such as myself who was quite closely involved in looking at the European Community budget in the late 1980s when I was an adviser in the Treasury. Beyond that, I have no other motive. I think that people should be made aware of exactly what is happening with the budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to hear that the hon. Gentleman takes some responsibility for what has gone before. Perhaps it was not the best way forward to spend some 25 or 30 minutes at the beginning of the sitting on procedural wrangling instead of getting down to the job of scrutinising the budget.<br><br>
I welcome the Government's negotiating approach to tomorrow's meeting of the Council of Ministers. I believe that the overall budget is prudent and that it meets our objectives in redistributing and reprioritising expenditure within the European Union. The zero growth in administration expenditure is welcome and, to an extent, that punctures the myth about excessive Brussels bureaucracy.<br><br>
It is worth saying, as my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has done, that there has been improvement in the financial perspectives agreed at the Edinburgh summit. That permitted a 7 per cent. increase in the budget for 1998. In fact, the increase is only 2.4 per cent., and 0.5 per cent. on agriculture.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has dealt with the arguments about the increase in the British contribution. However, further reductions are needed and, clearly, she will take on that matter in tomorrow's negotiations. It is worth stressing that the redistribution of expenditure within the EU budget is broadly to be welcomed. The significant increase in the trans-European networks and support for environmentally friendly transport modes, such as trains, and for small businesses, education and young people, especially the Socrates programme, is entirely welcome.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
The 100 mecu support in the budget for the Northern Ireland peace process, through support for industry, reinforces the fact that countries can pull together when there is a real issue of concern within the Community.<br><br>
I also support the welcome reprioritisation within the Prince programme towards developing information campaigns on the single currency. That is very much in line with the objectives that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor set out last week to ensure that there is an informed and meaningful debate about the pros and cons of the single currency. Sadly, there has been no such debate in the past.<br><br>
I also welcome the fact that allowance is made in the budget for 11 sessions of the Strasbourg Parliament in the coming year, as opposed to 12 in the previous settlement. I hope that the new Government will continue to press for further reductions in the number of Strasbourg sittings. Indeed, I hope that they press for them to be progressively phased out in favour of sitting in Brussels. Anyone who objectively considers the issues would agree that that is the correct way forward.<br><br>
Finally—I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary deals with this matter when summing up—many companies in my constituency have benefited from so-called Edinburgh cheap loan facilities. I understand that the Council of Ministers has not agreed a legal basis on which to continue that programme. A new fund, which is legal, has been established in its place. However, the new fund does not provide discounted loans for job creation. That is regrettable, given the Government's commitment to put employment measures at the top of the European agenda. Apparently, Germany, the Netherlands and the previous United Kingdom Government all objected to that decision. I wonder whether it can be reconsidered in the budget negotiations so as to contribute to job creation. Overall, the package is prudent and reprioritises in support of the measures that we, as a nation, support. I hope that the Committee will support it this evening.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the matter of fraud, I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the Select Committee on European Legislation said that the 1996 annual report was a shocking insight into the scale of the problem. I hope that the Government will give serious attention to the remedies being proposed under the Amsterdam treaty. We shall be returning to that when the treaty is up for application.<br><br>

I refer now to the proposals that have been inaugurated under the European Commission Directorate General XX on the office for the European public prosecution. The report states that that office will be:
<br><blockquote><p>"an independent authority of the European Union consisting of a European Public Prosecutor".</p></blockquote>
It will he "situated in Brussels" and will have "representatives of the European Public Prosecutor…situated in each Member State…the latter would be nominated and paid by each Member State".<br><br>
The report continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"European Public Prosecutors could exercise their duties in all the Member States…national public prosecutors would have the obliation to co-operate."</p></blockquote>
There are people who could easily regard that as an exceedingly dangerous weapon in the wrong hands.<br><br>
The document, as the Committee can see, runs to hundreds of pages, but it is extremely dangerous and insidious. If it were to be implemented, I fear for the rights that we have in this country of habeas corpus, trial by jury and so on. In relation to financial irregularities, we shall be visited in dawn raids by people who have been sent over to this country on the direction of the European public prosecutor, with an obligation for us to comply with the requirement.<br><br>
The Select Committee report of 19 February 1997 states that
<br><blockquote><p>"there are plans for a series of initiatives to launch a great debate on the theme of the European law enforcement area".</p></blockquote>
Those are matters that need to be considered. There is no time to go into them completely today, but I trust that the Minister will resist vigorously their incursion into the British judicial system.</span></p>
<p>6.47 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have almost done to death the Opposition amendment and have repeatedly made the point that the Opposition's figures are based on ecus. I believe the Treasury figures and those of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, and that we face an increase of 2.43 per cent., which compares reasonably with the increases faced by other EU members. [<i>Interruption.</i>] On this occasion, I believe the Treasury figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that this book—"European Community Finances: Statement on the 1997 EC Budget and measures to counter fraud and financial mismanagement"—is a Treasury book?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have that book but I shall read it after the sitting.<br><br>
If there were a substantial depreciation of sterling against European currencies, we would apparently get a substantial reduction in our ecu contribution, which would suggest, using the Opposition's logic, that we should increase our spending substantially to compensate. I think that they are wrong.<br><br>
I have some serious questions to ask my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary about the EU budget. Some criticisms and concerns hve already been expressed,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
not least about the common agriculture policy. Page 9 of the preliminary draft general budget shows that there have been real-terms increases in CAP spending, despite the CAP having a lower proportion of the overall budget spend. That is a matter of concern, and we must constantly examine CAP spending. Within a few years, there will be enlargement of the Community, and the CAP, as it currently operates, will not be viable, in view of the new countries' substantial, impoverished agricultural sectors. We must consider substantial reform of the CAP, to which the Government are committed.<br><br>
Other aspects of the budget are also slightly worrying. In the past few days, I have heard from colleagues in the European Parliament that there is a suggestion of putting the brake on structural fund spending, which helps countries and regions that are suffering unemployment and poverty. That suggestion is apparently being made by Germany. That is worrying, because some of us would like a higher proportion of spending to go on structural funds than is currently the case, to try to even up living standards and employment throughout the European Union. We should press that matter.<br><br>
There are many other points that I want to raise, but given the short time that we have left, I shall leave my contribution there.</span></p>
<p>6.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I have such a short time in which to reply to the debate. I shall try to answer every question that hon. Members have asked; if I cannot, I shall write to them as soon as possible. I hope that hon. Members will accept that I will not take interventions during the next 10 minutes, so that I can answer as many questions as possible.<br><br>
I am surprised at how much of the Committee's time has been wasted. At the start of the sitting, we spent 20 minutes on points of order. I accept that the right hon. Member for Wells has not had sufficient time to consider the documents. However, the circumstances are not of the Government's making. The Committee was established only on 14 July, and during the sitting we have tried to find out why the right hon. Gentleman did not receive documents. I suspect that the problem is that, in the past, the Front-Bench spokesman has been a member of the Committee; I cannot confirm that, but I will seek to do so. I had forgotten that as a consequence of the Conservative party's defeat, it is rather stretched to find members to serve on Committees.<br><br>
I was most surprised by the amendment tabled by the right hon. Gentleman. With his experience, he should have known that it was spurious. The point that he sought to make about ecu equivalence was one to which he referred in this Committee last year. I am most surprised at the right hon. Gentleman; I had thought better of him. Concerning his remarks about fraud, why, in this very Committee last year, did the Conservative Members of the Committee vote against a Labour amendment relating to fraud in the Community?<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
Before I turn to the substantive points raised by hon. Members, may I say that during the debate it dawned on my why Conservative Members did not want proper scrutiny of this budget: it is because the Labour Government are taking a better budget to Brussels tomorrow than the Budget that the Conservative Government brought to the House last year. Frankly, having been patronised by experts, I can normally spot when people are on the run.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Wells referred to fraud. I found his remarks bizarre; I suggest that he rereads the <i>Hansard</i> from last year. As part of the non-cooperation policy of the previous Government, they vetoed implementation of clauses on fraud at the Economic and Financial Council on 3 May 1996. The right hon. Gentleman referred to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. My right hon. Friend raised the issue of fraud at ECOFIN on 9 June specifically in relation to the documents that are tagged for the Committee. I recognise that being in opposition is difficult; we have been there and we know that it is difficult properly to research speeches, but I expected better from someone with the right hon. Gentleman's experience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I said that I would not give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. We have another serious situation, because a written answer given to the House is now misleading and inadequate in that it does not refer to the discussion on fraud that the Economic Secretary said took place. May I, through you, ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the written answer given in the name of the Chancery in order for a correction to be made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that was an intervention, but I leave it to the Minister to decide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also think that it was an intervention, but I shall not be deflected from addressing the serious points that hon. Members have raised. I shall refer to the written answer in due course. The right hon. Gentleman asked about the likely cash increase after all adjustments: it is £200 million. That figure is in the documentation, but I do not criticise the right hon. Gentleman for not having read that far.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) made an excellent speech which demonstrated his long involvement with EC issues. He drew attention to the costs of BSE. That is another example of the incompetence of the previous Government, in regard not only to Europe but to economics in general. As my hon. Friend said, the cost—which we must now carry—of that incompetence is £5 billion.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Dorset was not happy with my responses—I suspect that I was giving him credit for more perception than he showed, but I shall try to answer his points now. The hon. Gentleman took four minutes to tell us about the number of people he had telephoned and his knowledge of French; that does not add to the scrutiny of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
Committee. He asked what details existed of the way in which the money is spent. May I suggest that he turns to pages 8 and 9 of volume 0 where he will find the answers to that? On his point about the growth in the 1996 GNP: as I said earlier, GNP contributions are the balancing item on the revenue side of the EC budget. In 1996, we received a repayment due to underspending in 1995, which reduced the 1996 GNP payment; similarly, our 1997 repayment for 1996 reduces our 1997 GNP resource, and if we get a refund in 1998, that will reduce our 1998 GNP share. However, we cannot yet know whether we shall receive a refund because that is connected to underspending—an eventuality that cannot be known in advance. The hon. Gentleman also confused the repayments of underspending in previous years with purely technical adjustments—the figure of £4 million was in the latter category. The Community system is shifting towards more emphasis on the GNP resource; that is fairer and is good for Britain.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) drew blood among Opposition Members when he referred to the inanities to which we have had to listen this afternoon. As a matter of courtesy—I realised that I am not being especially courteous to my hon. Friends, although they know they can question me elsewhere on the matters under discussion—I shall move on to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). We welcome his support; he asked several specific and interesting questions that relate to his background. On his question about the Red Book, I can tell him and the right hon. Member for Wells that there is no change and that none is needed. Any hon. Member who has paid any attention to economic debates in the House—as I know the hon. Gentleman has; sadly, the right hon. Gentleman has not—will know that we have made it plain that we seek to operate within the constraints of the Budget that we inherited from the previous Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I said that I would not do so; I have two minutes in which to wind up the debate and, as I said, I have been patronised enough by experts in the past.<br><br>
I shall deal briefly with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet—I had no idea that he was a radiation biologist. We seek to ensure that member states report on their responses to the criticisms of the Court of Auditors in regard to the budget discharge. We hope as a Government to use the SEM 2000 proposals to try to achieve greater clarity and transparency.<br><br>
Time is running out, but I should like to say that I accept what has been said about the inadequacy of the scrutiny process. I hope that next year, when the Government will have been in office for longer than three months, we shall have a much better system of budget scrutiny and that the documentation will be clearer. However, we have inherited the conventions of

the previous Government, who are responsible for the obliqueness of the documentation. I therefore have pleasure in commending the motion to the Committee.</span></p>
