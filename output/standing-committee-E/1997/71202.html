Tobacco Advertising</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. It has been the experience of the Committee that papers have arrived rather late from time to time, and there have been complaints about that on every occasion. However, we have never previously received a paper so late as this—one of signal importance, the regulatory appraisal, has arrived on the morning of the sitting. Is it in order for the Committee to consider a paper that has arrived this late?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provision of papers is a matter for the Government, but I understand that the paper to which the hon. Gentleman referred was placed in the Vote Office, as well as being made available here this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. With regard to the Amsterdam treaty protocol and the role of national Parliaments, the Select Committee made it clear that it is essential that national Parliaments be given adequate and proper time in which to consider such important directives. It is absolutely clear that we have not been given the documents in time, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) has made clear with respect to the regulatory appraisal. In addition, we do not even know whether the text before the Committee is official and authorised. There have been switches and turns all the way down the line. There has been a continuous—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a matter for the Chair. What is a matter for the Chair is that the documents to be considered by the Committee have been made available and are in the Room. The Minister has heard what the hon. Gentleman has to say. She may refer to it and, if she does, I shall consider her in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Maclean <span class='memberconstituency'>(Penrith and The Border)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. Of course you are right that the documents are available in the Room, but I must tell the Minister that that is just not acceptable. This decision is one of the most important that the Government have made and it is a matter of enormous public controversy. It is not acceptable for the documents to have been put in the Vote Office, presumably late last night, so that most members of the Committee have been unable to get them until this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point, but it is not a matter for the Chair.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
<p>10.32 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to debate this important proposal. I should make it clear that when the House first considered the directive of 1992, an explanatory memorandum was prepared that included detailed estimated costs of implementation. The papers were circulated on receipt of the latest text, which was tabled by the presidency on Friday, together with further information for the convenience of members of the Committee and to elucidate on the matter. It is a bit rich for the Opposition to complain about papers that they claim they received too late, when they blocked the directive from 1989 until they lost the general election earlier this year.<br><br>
The Government have taken seriously the opportunity provided by this important piece of harmonising legislation. I want to restate why we support the directive and, in that context, be clear about the ends. Through the single market provisions of the treaty, the directive creates the possibility of a European-wide ban on tobacco advertising. The Government support that because smoking is the single greatest avoidable threat to the health of people in Britain. In particular, we are anxious about the increased prevalence of smoking among young people. One in three 15-year-old girls in Britain are established smokers—that is the great inheritance from the previous Government.<br><br>
A ban on tabacco advertising is necessary as part of a series of measures to combat smoking. All the evidence from countries that have introduced bans on tabacco advertising suggests that unless tabacco advertising is banned, consumptin is not reduced. The policy attracts strong public support. More than 60 per cent. of people surveyed said that they were in favour of the Government's action on the matter. That is why our manifesto pledged us to ban tobacco advertising. An opportunity to ban it has been on the table since 1989. As I made clear, that opportunity was blocked by the previous Government, who gave a series of progressively pathetic justifications. This Government's serious determination to combat smoking has lead to the reopening of serious negotiation with other member states—our European partners.<br><br>
The Government have a clear position, which we have had since we started renegotiating the directive. We have sought to reconcile our commitment to ban tobacco advertising and so reduce cigarette consumption with our determination to protect those sports that, over the years, have become highly dependent on tabacco companies' sponsorship.<br><br>
We believe that the latest text, which has been circulated to members of the Committee, shows that the Government's strong stance in the negotiations is beginning to bear fruit. The draft text that was tabled by the presidency on Friday provides a structure that begins to meet some of the Government's anxieties. We are not there yet, but we believe that that is a good basis for further negotiation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0577">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
The Government are anxious to ensure that while we meet out objective of reducing smoking, we also address the concerns of sport. As recently as last week, my right hon. Friend Prime Minister, my hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and I met a number of representatives from a range of sports to discuss further their anxieties about the replacement of tobacco sponsorship. The meeting was extremely productive and produced a good basis for further Government support for sport in this transitional period.<br><br>
There is a key meeting of the Health Council on Thursday, at which we hope a common position may be reached. It is not certain that it will be—the Government are not alone in still having outstanding concerns about the directive. We are at a historic moment in the issue of public health in Britain. A Labour Government are seriously setting about tackling the causes of smoking by seeking to ban tobacco advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee now has time for questions to the Minister, which may last until 11.30 am at the latest. I remind the Committee that the time is for questions and that the debate will follow. As is the custom, I shall give precedence to members of the Committee. I am aware that there are many hon. Members present who are not members of the Committee and I hope that as a courtesy to them members of the Committee will keep their questions brief and that the Minister will keep her answers concise so that as many hon. Members as possible will have the opportunity to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can ask the Minister a question that will help her to set the scene. She has long—in fact, as far back as 1992, when she was a member of the Select Committee on Health—held the views that are espoused in the directive; she has been one of the protagonists of the policy. However, the policy is now, in some respects, radically different from what it was before 16 October. Will she take us through the thought process that enabled her to change her position and the Government to change their policy from not being in favour of a special exemption for formula one sponsorship to exempting formula one from the directive? What are the reasons for that change?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I want to make it absolutely clear to the Committee that the policy is exactly the same to seek a ban on tobacco advertising that will work in practice and will not create the perverse effect of sport—in particular formula one, which is the centre of our concern on this aspect—leaving the European Union and moving to parts of the world where there is no regulation of tobacco advertising, including television advertising, thereby exposing people in this country to more, not less, tobacco advertising. The attempts made by the Opposition to paint this as a change in policy beggar belief, but they are all that they can resort to because they have nothing to offer on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
issue of banning tobacco advertising. The policy remains the same. Our focus now is on ensuring that we implement the policy so that it will work in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend the Minister aware of the experience of other countries that have bans on tobacco advertising? What are their experiences of the impacts of consumption?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that question. There are bans on tobacco advertising in other countries, both in the European Union and beyond, such as Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Norway. The evidence is clear and was succinctly analysed by the Department of Health's chief economist, Dr. Clive Smee, in 1992. He concluded first, that advertising does influence tobacco consumption, and secondly, that in countries that had instituted a ban on tobacco advertising, the introduction of the ban was followed by a fall in consumption that could not be attributed to other causes.<br><br>
I must add that we are clear that a ban on advertising alone will not reduce smoking prevalence, which is our objective, especially among young people. That is why a ban on advertising is one of a series of measures to combat smoking which we intend to implement. The other measures will form part of a White Paper to be published next year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify a question relating to her statement to the Select Committee on European Legislation on 19 November? She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our submission is for a permanent exemption for Formula 1."</p></blockquote>
From newspaper reports today, there appears to be considerable doubt as to whether that exemption will be permanent. Various theories are put forward for bans of four-and-a-half years, six years and 10 years. Will the Minister tell the Committee now what the position is, whether there has been a change of policy and whether that is reflected in the current text? I am sure that she will understand that it is impossible for the Committee to come to a measured conclusion on such a matter when such a fundamental issue is up in the air.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made it absolutely clear in the Select Committee that our objective in the discussions is to do everything we can to negotiate an acceptable text which will enable us to reach a common position on 4 December. There are two elements in that—first, a workable framework in which to apply the ban on tobacco advertising, and secondly, provisions to safeguard sport, and formula one in particular. Those are the objectives towards which we are negotiating. I am sure that the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) will recognise that one enters the process of negotiation with a position and an objective. Our objectives are absolutely clear and we are negotiating hard with other member states to meet them. If we believe that we have met them on 4 December, we will be able to support the text; if not, we will not be able to support it.<br><br>
Once again, there is a stark contrast between the Government's approach and the entirely negative approach of the previous Government to negotiation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0578">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
in Europe. We want to build a consensus on our view with other member states. We believe that the revised presidency text, which was tabled on Friday, is a good building block. There is a lot still to be negotiated in the short time available, but we are absolutely clear about our objectives: a ban on tobacco advertising and proper protection for sport, and formula one in particular.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that rates of smoking correlate inversely with standard social class—the most affluent smoke least, and vice versa. Is my hon. Friend the Minister aware of any research into what that might be and how the situation is influenced by tobacco advertising? Does she agree that the resistance to a ban on advertising by the previous Government and Conservative Members could be interpreted as an attack on the living standards and health of the poorest in our society?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right—the poorer one is, the more likely one is to smoke, and the more one is likely to smoke. Of particular concern is the scale of smoking among young women. Many of them are lone parents for whom, in many cases, smoking is their only source of comfort.<br><br>
As I said in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), no single measure will begin to tackle the harm that smoking does; also necessary are measures to get lone mothers into work, to improve housing and to improve child care—measures designed to put hope and optimism back into lives that are blighted by despair.<br><br>
The evidence is clear—there is a direct link between poverty and the likelihood of smoking. That important fact will be addressed by our forthcoming White Paper, which will be designed, in line with the thrust of our public health policy, not only to improve people's overall health, but to tackle some of the most intractable inequalities. The level of smoking among poor people is one of those intractable inequalities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister told us that if the discussion on Thursday goes favourably, she will find the proposal acceptable. She sprung some additional papers on us this morning, which we have had only a brief chance to read. The new text refers to allowing a further period of "x" years for member states to continue to authorise existing sponsorship. That will be the loophole through which formula one will be allowed to wriggle. What figure for "x" will be acceptable to her on Thursday?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We expect there to be a further text at the Health Council on Thursday. As I have made clear, the proposed transitional period for sport and arts events, as set out in the new draft text, offers the possibility of an acceptable compromise. However, we are not there yet. I regard this as a matter for negotiation. I am sure that Conservative Members will understand that these negotiations are best conducted with other member states at what is a sensitive time in negotiations regarding the directive, rather than being conducted in the full glare of television and the national media.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The Minister said that she is expecting a further text. When you ruled on my point of order earlier, you said that the Committee would have the opportunity to consider such texts as were before it. However, this is a rolling programme. At the heart of the question is the exemption for formula one, which the Minister said only a few days ago, in the Select Committee was to be permanent. We now know that the Government are not intending to stand by that. We are faced with a farrago of nonsense from the Minister—the scene is constantly shifting, like a kaleidoscope. It is intolerable that a Committee should be treated like this, with confusion, contradiction and skulduggery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As I said earlier, the provision of documents for the consideration of the Committee is a matter for the Government, not the Chair. The Chair deprecates the fact that on occasion in Committee not all the documents that hon. Members will wish to discuss are present—but that is a matter for the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that the matter before us is not new? There was a previous directive from 1989, which has been blocked partly by the previous Government. How far is my hon. Friend the Minister taking negotiations on the issue, and what success has she had?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The text before us is, in many respects, different from that which was considered by the Select Committee in 1992. The section relating to a transitional period for sport—adjustment to a non-tobacco regime—is a derogation on which negotiation is being led by the UK in order to deliver our commitment that sport will be protected during this period of transition.<br><br>
This is about meeting the objectives, about which we have been absolutely clear—to secure a framework that will ban tobacco advertising, to strike a proper balance between EU-wide measures and measures to be taken by member states, and having a measure that provides proper protection for sport, and global sport such as formula one in particular.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. You ruled a moment ago that the Committee must consider the items before it. The motion asks the Committee to take note of
<br><blockquote><p>"European Community Document No. 6294/92".</p></blockquote>
It does not refer to any of the later text. I take it, therefore, that the Minister is not asking us to consider the other text that she brought before us or the more recent text that she gave us last night. Is that a correct point of order, Mr. Gale?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will consider the documents that the Government have made available to it. That includes, as the motion describes, the unnumbered explanatory memorandum. That is a substitute for a numbered document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. Does that mean that we should not be taking account of other numbered documents, which include
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0579">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
the relevant document—namely, the working document that the Minister distributed last night? If so, the Committee is not being asked to take note of that document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has had referred to it the documents named and numbered in the motion. Those are the documents that the Committee is considering this morning. However, it may be for the convenience of hon. Members to consider other documents. The documents whose consideration is to be decided at the end of the debate of those, and only those, listed in the motion. I hope that that clarifies the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The document under consideration states that it will authorise existing sponsorship of "exceptional events." What elements make an event exceptional?<br><br>
The document also states that those exceptional events are organised at "world level". What does that mean? Which events are organised at world level? Formula one motor racing has been mentioned, but tobacco firms also sponsor cricket, which has at least as wide an audience throughout the world. They also sponsor golf, whose television audience far exceeds formula one's. They also sponsor snooker—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will ask his question soon. This is the time for questions; the debate follows.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The obscure language that is used in these matters, Mr. Gale, means that, to get a clear answer from the Minister, I wanted to explain my question carefully.<br><br>
I listed three other sports receiving tobacco sponsorship that clearly are exceptional and organised on a world scale. Are they also included in the exemption?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have made clear, this text will be discussed further at the Health Council on Thursday. However, the UK is worried about the risk that, without some measure of protection, certain sports could move to other parts of the world where the anti-tobacco regimes are less restrictive.<br><br>
Formula one is marked out from other sports in two ways. First, there is the scale of its global operation. It is more a global sport than one associated with a particular country—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about golf or snooker?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should listen to my second point, which is that formula one is marked out by the scale of its dependence on tobacco sponsorship. For those two reasons, and because the formula one industry is so important to the UK, we have argued that the directive should provide for such exceptional cases.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
The way in which the directive is framed is evidence of the UK's tough negotiating stance and of the Government's intention to deliver the objectives set out by me and my colleagues in recent weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recall that Imperial Tobacco handed over 2,000 poster sites to the Conservative Party during the 1992 election campaign? The company justified that by stating that,
<br><blockquote><p>"speaking as a tobacco company, we would like to see the Conservative Party re-elected because we believe they will continue to oppose the advertising ban."</p></blockquote>
In the light of that statement, do not the Opposition's crocodile tears about an advertising ban lack conviction, to say the least?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. People who listen to the debate and read reports of it will draw their own conclusions about the Opposition. They have offered nothing in the way of constructive policies to deal with the levels of death and illness in this country caused by smoking. Not once have they produced proposals to reduce smoking among children. They have resorted to nasty smear, innuendo and procedural tactics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister of her opening statement, when she said that smoking was the single greatest avoidable threat to health in this country, and of her Department's regulatory appraisal, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Tobacco is a uniquely dangerous product. If introduced today it would not stand the remotest chance of being a legal product."</p></blockquote>
How can she reconcile the directive with the policy of the European Union, which she supports and promotes—at least, the Financial Secretary does—namely, the disbursement of 950,000 ecu in subsidy to tobacco producers in southern Europe? I work that out to be £1 of subsidy, much of it from the British taxpayer, for every death attributed to tobacco smoking within the European Union—500,000 deaths a year, says the regulatory appraisal. Are not the Government wilful accomplices to a policy that is morally flawed and practically ineffective?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, Conservative Members have only short-term memory. They have forgotten everything that went on before 1 May. They were in power for 18 years, during which the tobacco subsidy—part of the common agricultural policy—increased. Even in my relatively short time as a Member of Parliament, I do not recall attending many debates in the previous Government's time calling for a reduction in the subsidy.<br><br>
There is inconsistency. We want reform of the CAP and there are extremely strong health grounds for reforming the subsidy for tobacco growing. Virtually all the tobacco is exported to Africa and to the developing world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So it does not matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it matters. We take seriously our responsibility to people in parts of the world who are being bombarded by tobacco from America and the European Union. Lung cancer, whether it occurs in

Southampton or South Korea, hurts just as much and is just as unpleasant a way to die. There is a case for reform of the CAP, which is why that is at the centre of our policy of reform of Eruopean institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Much of the criticism that has been levied against the Minister has been based on the premise that formula one is the only sport that the Government are trying to wean off tobacco advertising. What is being done to help other sports to get new advertising?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I made clear earlier, my hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister met a delegation from various sports, including rugby league, the National Federation of Anglers, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the English Pool Association, the Professional Golfers Association, the Ice Hockey Super League, the British Darts Organisation, and the England and Wales Cricket Board, together with representatives from the Central Council of Physical Recreation. They discussed their concerns about managing the transitional phase.<br><br>
I must emphasise the strong view that came out of that and other meetings with sports representatives—they want a phasing out of tobacco sponsorship and an end to their dependence on tobacco sponsorship. However, they recognise—and are grateful for our recognistion—that they need time and support to negotiate that. That is what we intend to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware of the Cabinet office guidelines on risk assessment? In particular, is she aware that the statement on page 3, section 1.7, dealing with EC legislation makes it clear that a risk appraisal should be made early in the process? Can she tell us on what date this risk appraisal, which is dated November and which we received last night, was prepared? When did the Minister become aware that £35 million of the estimated total of £100 million of advertising related to formula one? By what extent does she believe that £35 million will increase when under her proposals formula one obtains a monopoly for an unspecified period of "X" years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The explanatory memorandum that was prepared for the Scrutiny Comittee in 1992 included assessment both of risk and of the financial consequences of the proposed directive. The memorandum that was made available last night was prepared on the basis of supplementary information for the convenience of members of the Committee and as I explained earlier, in the light of the revisions to the text which were circulated after the meeting on Friday. The 1992 explanatory memorandum sets out the estimates of the impact on industry of the proposed directive. The figures quoted in that memorandum, and those that have been quoted subsequently, are in the public domain.<br><br>
Let me be clear on the hon. Gentleman's point about formula one. The estimate of £35 million that he quoted is the estimated value of tobacco sponsorship
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
received by British-based formula one teams, not the global figure for formula one tobacco sponsorship, which is estimated to be considerably higher.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister say more about the deal that has been reported in this morning's papers? The Committee has tended to focus on the issue of formula one, for reasons that will no doubt emerge in the debate, but as I understand it, that is only one aspect of the deal and there are many other proposals relating to tobacco advertising, such as banning advertising on posters and in magazines. Can my hon. Friend comment on those proposals and how effective she thinks they will be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier and as hon. Members will be aware, the directive provides extensive powers to ban indirect advertising and promotion of tobacco and tobacco products but also leaves to member states other matters, relating in particular to point-of-sale advertising and advertising through trade journals and what are called third country publications, which several countries have said should be exempt from the directive. A range of measures is included in the directive, some of which will apply on a Europe-wide basis, and others which will be implemented domestically.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is correct that effective action on smoking cannot be confined to the measures contained in the directive. Other European states are further ahead than we are in taking action to combat smoking. As I have already said, we intend to put forward in a White Paper, to be published next year, a wide range of measures, focusing in particular on reducing smoking among young people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do you accept that Liberal Democrat Members fully support your objectives? As a clinician, I would certainly support your contention that you need to give help—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman may put his question as he wishes, but it must go through the Chair. I do not have an opinion on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Gale. I thought that we were putting questions to the Minister, but I will direct my question through you. Would the Minister also confirm that it is important to have a specific end-point when addicts' treatment plans are being discussed? It is helpful that "x" has been introduced. Will the Minister assure us that "x" is a finite number and not infinity? That would prove that there has been a definite change in Government policy, in that there will not be an indefinite exemption from the ban, but it will have a definite time limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been no change in Government policy. We are going to ban tobacco advertising. This ridiculous dispute, which is the result of pathetic attempts by the Opposition to drum up a smokescreen, is about means, not ends. The end is to ban tobacco advertising, and that is what we shall do. We are negotiating the means by which we will put in place a ban that will work.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0581">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McNulty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree, in light of the previous comments, that more progress in achieving that policy objective has been made in the past eight months than in the previous eight years? Can she outline the consequences for successfully achieving that objective if the wrecking amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples) prevails and we go backwards instead of forwards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The important point is that this harmonising measure will also have important public health benefits. We believe passionately in the importance of banning tobacco advertising as part of combating the damage that smoking does. The amendment is a public declaration of the extent to which Conservative Members have nothing to offer in this debate. They should be hanging their heads in shame that they have contributed so little. Constructive proposals and negotiations on a ban that will work in practice will be the action of the Government, with no support whatever from the Opposition—only obstruction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful if the Minister would give a detailed and considered reply to the question that I am about to ask her. As a lawyer who has done some European work, I am concerned as to whether there is a secure legal base for the directive to which the Minister is proposing to sign up.<br><br>
Will she confirm that the Council Legal Service, in an opinion issued in December 1993, advised that the proposed directive could not be justified under article 100a, because that article authorises only measures that have as their objective the establishment and functioning of the internal market. The Council Legal Service, in what seems to be its most recent opinion, said that because the directive sought only to regulate advertising, which has no effect on intra-Community trade, and imposed requirements that were disproportionate to the Community's interests in eliminating obstacles to free movement, it could not be justified under article 100a.<br><br>
Will the Minister confirm that the Council Legal Service has not provided a further written opinion more recently than December 1993? If so, will she undertake to ensure that another opinion is sought? If the second opinion confirms the first, and bearing in mind the Minister's repeated assertions on radio and television that this is a health measure—it would completely undermine article 100a as the basis for the proposed directive—will she come back to the Committee before the Government sign up to any directive with a clear understanding that article 100a is not the proper basis for such a directive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to paragraph 16 of the report of the Select Committee on European Legislation, to which I gave evidence two weeks ago. Having gone carefully through the arguments about the acceptability of article 100a as a legal base for the measure, the Committee concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not dissent from the view that Article 100a is an acceptable legal base."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
For the hon. Gentleman's benefit, I shall again express the view that I expressed to that Committee. We are discussing a harmonising measure that is needed because a nunmber of EU countries have different tobacco regimes. A single market cannot be achieved without similarity between the regimes. The Government noted the 1993 opinion of the Council Legal Service. I stress that the Committee is working on a different text from that of 1993. Representatives of the Council Legal Service have been present at all of the working group's meetings. They have not dissented from the view that article 100a is an acceptable treaty base. We have sought the advice of Whitehall lawyers, all of whom confirmed that there is no obstacle in the treaty base to the approval of the directive.<br><br>
Ultimately, the issue rests on a matter of judgment. Having sought advice, it is my judgment that article 100a is an appropriate legal base. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to article 100a(3), which refers to the requirement for a high level of health protection in relation to the single market measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The Minister, as a member of the Select Committee on European Legislation, is right to point out that that Committee stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not dissent from the view that Article 100a is an acceptable legal base."</p></blockquote>
The Select Committee did not, and did not intend to, endorse the Government's position, but merely to state that it did not dissent—I have taken advice on the matter. That is quite different from stating that the Government's position is right. The Minister is misleading the Committee by drawing a different conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a point of argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McWalter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend the Minister see this morning's interview with Jackie Stewart, in which he made two points about the Government's policy on formula one? They are helpful in trying to calculate the value of "X" years. His first point was about the enormous scale of tobacco support for the sport. His second was that that damages the sport because teams such as his, which lack tobacco support, are financially handicapped, which can make the sport uncompetitive. Will my hon. Friend confirm that that shows how complicated it is to calculate the value of "X" years, and how important it is to do so sensitively and after protracted negotiation with the experts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the negotiation is complex and delicate. I hope that we can resolve it. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for recognising the extent of care that has to be taken to get the matter right.<br><br>
The Government have consistently made it clear that formula one is marked out from other sports by the sheer scale of its dependence on tobacco sponsorship. It is important to reiterate a point made very strongly by the sporting delegation that met my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister last week. Its members made it clear that they wished to get rid of tobacco sponsorship. The problem facing formula one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0582">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
is that tobacco companies have poured money into the teams, causing enormous price inflation. It will take time for the teams to replace tobacco sponsorship with sponsorship from other sources.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Last week, the Minister gave evidence to the Select Committee on Health, in particular about the exemption of formula one from the directive. That Labour-dominated Committee rushed out a report at the end of last week that rejected her explanation comprehensively. What was the Minister's reaction to that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My reaction to that was the same as my reaction to all the events of the past few weeks. My job is to negotiate a ban on tobacco advertising. I use all my best endeavours to that end and shall continue to do so. If we deliver a ban on tobacco advertising, the UK Government will have cause to be proud of having taken constructive and positive action to combat the harm done by tobacco to people in this country.<br><br>
I have no respect whatsoever for Opposition Members who bring nothing to the debate except pathetic procedural points. They apply bits of smear here and there, but do nothing to deal with the major public health issue represented by the levels of smoking in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will know that the sale of cigarettes to children has been illegal since 1908. She will know also that, through advertising and other means, the tobacco companies have been fully aware that children still have easy access to cigarettes. Every day, even very young children can be seen smoking in our streets.<br><br>
Does my hon. Friend have any plans to tackle that problem and protect our children from the tobacco companies—and from a Tory party that has been in those companies' pockets for decades?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that young people under 16 find it easy to buy cigarettes. A 1994 survey showed that only 35 per cent. of all the 11 to 15-year-olds who had tried to buy cigarettes in the previous year had been refused. When questioned further about easy sources for the purchase of cigarettes by children of their age group, 74 per cent. of those young people cited vending machines, 69 per cent. cited local corner shops, 49 per cent. cited off-licences and 42 per cent. cited garages. Supermarkets were cited by 24 per cent. of respondents.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is right: the ease with which young people can buy cigarettes is a major problem. I hope that the White Paper that is to be published next year will contain wider proposals to combat the consumption of cigarettes, especially among children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Woodward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is aware that the Select Committee on European Legislation recently felt unable to clear the directive because she could not answer a number of questions that were put to her. A crucial question involved the special treatment that was given to formula one. Meetings with that sport went on for six months. There were three meetings with Ministers, including one with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
Prime Minister on 16 October. That meeting was held about six or seven weeks before the meeting that is about to take place on 4 December—all for formula one. That was not a privilege extended to other sports. They had a meeting which several bodies attended—not a special meeting, such as that which formula one had with the Prime Minister—nine days, not six months, before the directive was introduced.<br><br>
The Minister was unable to give us an answer to a question that we asked her last week. Perhaps she can tell us today. What percentage share of annual income does tobacco sponsorship constitute for formula one racing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I refer the hon. Gentleman to a reply that I gave on 28 November to a Parliamentary question from the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps you would like to listen to the answer that I am trying to give.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am paying great attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to study that parliamentary answer. It sets out clearly the scale of consultation that has taken place with sporting interests throughout our period of office.<br><br>
On the percentage share of formula one sponsorship income from tobacco, the estimate that I gave the European Select Committee was about £100 million. That represents about half of all the sponsorship income received by formula one. It is a considerable proportion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Casale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to ask this question, because Conservative Members seem to have lost sight of the fact that the aim of a ban on tobacco advertising is to tackle smoking. Of course, such a ban is only the first step in that direction. It might be helpful to the Committee if my hon. Friend the Minister puts the matter before us in the context of the Government's wider strategy and commitment to tackling tobacco consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to put the measures proposed in the directive in a wider context. I refer my hon. Friend to some of the issues that I raised when I gave evidence to the Health Select Committee and which we shall be considering.<br><br>
As I have made clear, we are particularly concerned about the susceptibility of children and young people to smoking. We are enormously concerned about the increase in the number of young girls who smoke. Last year, for the first time since 1972, there was an increase in the prevalence of smoking. Again, that is the legacy of the previous Government, whose pathetic and shameful neglect of this area of public health has meant that an increasing number of children and women now smoke.<br><br>
Based on the evidence of the harm done by tobacco, we must address a wide range of measures. We need to look at tighter regulation of smoking in public places, protection for people in smoky workplaces and access to support or help in giving up smoking. We need to look at the price of cigarettes because of the link between price and consumption. We must also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0583">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
consider a range of measures to make it harder for children to get hold of cigarettes. That gives an indication of the range of measures that will be developed in the White Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister criticised Conservative Members for raising procedural questions, but implicit in that is criticism of the Select Committee. The Select Committee was condemnatory of the Government's position with respect to the provision of documents, stating:
<br><blockquote><p>"We still do not have a final and authoritative text".</p></blockquote>
The Select Committee concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"We remind the Government that a debate in Standing Committee, and approval of the subsequent Motion on the Floor of the House, must take place before the Health Council meets; otherwise we will expect the Minister to impose a Scrutiny Reserve."</p></blockquote>
Does it not follow that, in view of the confused nature of the documents and the fact that we have not had satisfactory answers to any of the fundamental questions that we have asked, it is essential that the Minister imposes a scrutiny reserve on the document? Otherwise, she will make a mockery of the arrangements for national parliamentary scrutiny.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is for the Committee to decide whether a scrutiny reserve should be imposed. Of the hon. Gentleman's contribution, I say only that he always behaves true to form. The documents circulated last night were as up to date as possible, for the convenience of the Committee and for no other purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings us to the end of questions. Before I call the Minister to move the motion, I should inform the Committee that I have selected the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon.</span></p>
<p>11.31 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 6294/92 and the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Department of Health on 17th November 1997, on tobacco advertising; and supports the Government's efforts to bring into effect a ban on tobacco advertising.</p></blockquote>
It gives me great pleasure to move this important motion urging the Committee's support for the Government's efforts to bring into effect a ban on tobacco advertising. This is an important debate. We are the first British Government to seek a ban on tobacco advertising as part of a wider range of public health measures to combat smoking. Unless we are successful in securing an effective ban, the other elements of our anti-smoking strategy are unlikely to succeed.<br><br>
As I have made clear, the measure is needed to harmonise tobacco regimes across Europe. Other member states—Finland, France, Spain and Sweden—already have bans and the Belgian Senate has just agreed a tough anti-tobacco strategy. However, evidence of the effectiveness of bans on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
tobacco advertising is already available in the experience of non-EU countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Norway, all of which experienced a reduction in cigarette consumption after implementing a ban.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will accept the new text, which marks a staging point in our negotiating objectives, provides a building block. We are not satisfied that all our concerns have been met. I reiterate that we are anxious to meet two objectives—first, the securing of an effective ban on tobacco advertising while acknowledging that implementing it will be difficult and require delicate negotitation, and secondly the paying of particular attention to sport.<br><br>
We have identified formula one as of particular concern because of the sheer scale in case terms of its sponsorship and its global nature. It is important to be clear that the figure of 50 per cent. that we have, which is an estimate of the proportion of overall sponsorship that tobacco represents, is not necessarily the highest level when compared with all other sports. However, what marks out formula one from other sports is, first—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the amount of money that formula one receives, which has built up over the past 30 years. Formula one is marked out, secondly, by the extent to which it is a uniquely global sport. In putting in place a practical ban, we want to avoid the perverse effect that pictures from around the world will be screened on our televisions, showing unregulated tobacco advertising, thereby exposing people in this country to more, not less tobacco advertising. Having said that, I have also made clear our determination to provide support to all sports during a process of transition, which they want to achieve, from dependence on tobacco sponsorship to dependence on other forms of sponsorship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not taking any interventions.<br><br>
Those were our objectives when I appeared before the Select Committee on European Legislation and when I appeared before the Select Committee on Health. They will remain the objectives against which we will judge the success of our negotiations with other member states on Thursday. I hope that the Committee will support this important measure.</span></p>
<p>11.36 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maples <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the motion in line 1, leave out from "or' to end and add
<br><blockquote><p>"the Government's complete change of policy on tobacco advertising after the Prime Minister met representatives of Formula One on 16th October 1997; the Minister of Public Health's totally unconvincing attempts to explain this change of policy; the misleading arguments by ministers over threatened job losses in Formula One and the composition of the Blocking Minority in the Council of Ministers: and the Government's preference for backdoor legislation via EU Directive rather than by bringing a Bill before Parliament where it can be properly debated; believes that the Government has effectively wrecked the

Tobacco Advertising Directive which it purports to support; and declines to take note of European Community Document No. 6294/92 and the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Department of Health on 17th November 1997."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether we could try to introduce a little objectivity—[<i>Laughter.</i>] Well, let us try. Let us try to take the party names from the story and the individuals and imagine that some time ago, a wealthy business man gave a large amount of money to a political party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Tories.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A political party. It subsequently won a general election. The party's fundraisers returned to the wealthy business man and said, "We have spent your money and a good bit more besides. How about a second donation?" He said, "I have a problem with you guys. You are about to do something that will be very bad for my business." The fundraisers said, "We will fix it for you to have a meeting with the Prime Minister." He met the Prime Minister, the policy was changed and the party continued to pursue a second donation.<br><br>
Had that happened 12 months ago, what would Labour Members have said?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not taking any interventions either.<br><br>
There would have been calls for a public inquiry and there would have been allegations of corruption. Now, Labour Members will not even admit that there was an error in procedure. Before new Labour changed the political vocabulary in May, that kind of attitude was known by the old-fashioned name of hypocrisy.<br><br>
Let us consider how this policy was changed. In a speech to the Royal College of Nursing in May, the Secretary of State for Health made it clear that sport would be included in the ban. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We recognise that some sports are heavily dependent on tobacco sponsorship … but they must recognise that by helping promote the sales of tobacco they are harming the health of many of their own sports spectators and viewers".</p></blockquote>
That must have been Government policy because on the same day the Minister for Sport—we know that he never says anything that is not on-message—said in answer to a parliamentary question:
<br><blockquote><p>"Motor racing in this country relies to a degree on sponsorship from the tobacco industry. However, I have been supplied with a list of all the other sponsors of motor racing and there are clearly adequate substitutes. One does not want to see the sport suffer as this country benefits enormously from … the motor racing industry. However, there is a manifesto undertaking."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 19 May 1997; Vol. 294, c. 361.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister, after her tobacco summit on 14 July, issued a press release in which she said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Certainly we want to see an end to tobacco advertising in the form of sports sponsorship".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I understood it that the hon. Gentleman was quoting from a reply to a parliamentary question. Can I make sure that the record is correct, because I think that he has deliberately misled the Committee?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members do not mislead the House. That is not a point of order for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was actually quoting from two departmental press releases and the <i>Hansard</i> record of what the Minister for Sport said on 19 May. If I have misquoted, no doubt the hon. Lady will correct me later.<br><br>
The Minister reinforced the message on 14 July, it is clear to everybody, including Labour Members, that the policy as at 14 July and, I suggest, for two months thereafter, was that tobacco sponsorship of sport would be included in the ban. It is difficult to understand how the hon. Lady could write—she did not have to do it—in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of all things— on 11 November, which was conveniently the day of Health questions in the House:
<br><blockquote><p>"The decision to propose an exemption for Formula One is one that has my total support. The Prime Minister and I are as one on the issue."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that sycophancy can ever have been carried to such unnecessary lengths. It must have made even the apparatchiks at No. 10 blush that she felt the need not only to do a 180-degree U-turn, but to pretend that she was in favour of it all along.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that the best you can do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a lot more to come.<br><br>
The hon. Lady was a member of the Health Select Committee in 1992 when it endorsed the idea of such a ban. Evidence was presented to that Committee by the Central Council of Physical Recreation on the tobacco sponsorship of motor racing, but that did not feature in the arguments then.<br><br>
The fact is that the policy was changed after the Prime Minister met representatives of formula one on 16 October—the Minister and the Secretary of State were not even invited to the meeting. In my experience, it is difficult for a business man to get a meeting with the Prime Minister, but it is unheard of for the relevant Secretary of State not to be invited to attend if consideration is being given to the reversal of a policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I am not familiar with the rules of the Committee, but is there a ruling about it being customary to address the documents that are in front of the Committee rather than historical or personal issues?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I explain now that because this is a contentious issue, I have taken great care to seek advice. I am advised that everything that has been said and is likely to be said in this context is in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State disappeared from the airwaves, unusually for him, and left the Minister of State to carry the can. When he was finally cornered on the "Today" programme about two and a half weeks later to answer questions on another subject, he was asked three times by the presenter to say whether he agreed with the formula one exemption. He declined on each occasion to do so.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0585">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
Later that day—no doubt after he had been telephoned in his office—he issued a statement saying that of course he completely agreed with it, but he had declined to do so three times before that.<br><br>
What excuses has the Minister given for that about-turn in policy? She talked about jobs; she claimed that formula one would leave Europe; and she said that television would beam grand prix races back to the UK. I do not think any of those arguments stand a lot of examination, and they have all been effectively rubbished by a variety of other bodies.<br><br>
<i>The Economist,</i> in an article in November, referred to
<br><blockquote><p>"the fatuous and self-serving arguments about protecting jobs made by Formula One's bosses."</p></blockquote>
It pointed out that Indycars are made here, 4,000 miles from where their races take place. Apparently, those jobs would have been affected, too. It went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Formula One lobby claims there are 50,000 British jobs involved; that figure"—</p></blockquote>
which was used by the Minister and her colleagues for some time—
<br><blockquote><p>"is a gross exaggeration".</p></blockquote>
The British Medical Association said in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of the same month:
<br><blockquote><p>"The government's only honourable exit from this debacle is to admit that it goofed — If Ms Jowell continues to support the unsupportable line that she has advanced both in parliament and in print when she has no place as a minister for public health."</p></blockquote>
That is not me speaking, but the <i>British Medical Journal.</i> It wants to know
<br><blockquote><p>"what's the point of a minister who says all the right things but is over-ruled when the going gets tough?"</p></blockquote>
It also states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nobody believes the government's stated reasons for its proposed exemption—because they don't withstand serious scrutiny."</p></blockquote>
Then there are the two Select Committee reports. The Health Select Committee listened to the Minister at some length and, although it is dominated by Labour Members—seven out of 11—it rushed out a report last Thursday which completely rubbished what she has said. I have never heard of that happening before. It stated that nothing that the Minister had said gave it any reason to demur from its conclusions. It also stated that the European Legislation Select Committee could have passed the directive but because of the row that erupted in it, its compromise between sending it to the Floor of the House and approving it was to send it to the Health Select Committee. The final nail in the coffin of credibility that the Minister erected around herself is a letter from the Commissioner, Padraig Flynn, who wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"I do not believe that the issues raised in defence of derogation of Formula 1 stand up to scrutiny. In particular, I believe that the implicit threat that the industry would relocate more grand prix events outside the EU is not credible … I would also add that Formula l's assumption that third countries will continue to be indifferent to tobacco sponsorship and advertising could be very seriously misguided."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
Perhaps the most important point of all, in view of what the Minister has said today, is Commissioner Flynn's assertion that there are
<br><blockquote><p>"also very real practical problems with a proposal to specifically exempt Formula 1 from the directive, not least the formal opposition of several Member States to such an exemption. Clearly, other sports will press for similar treatment which will be difficult to deny. There may also be competition implications".</p></blockquote>
I have never heard a policy rubbished by a Government's allies—a European Commissioner and a Labour-dominated Select Committee—so effectively.<br><br>
The Commissioner makes the point about how badly other sports have been treated. The Minister answered a parliamentary question of mine by confirming that there was a meeting between her and representatives of formula one on 23 September: However, representatives from snooker, darts and cricket did not get to meet a minister from the Department of Health: they met only the Minister of Sport. Formula one representatives also got a secret meeting with the Prime Minister—a difficult thing to get.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving way. Representatives of snooker and darts did not get a meeting with the Prime Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at that time: they got a meeting only after the decision was made. At that time, only formula one was granted such a meeting.<br><br>
The Minister has said that formula one relies on tobacco sponsorship for 50 per cent. of its income, but snooker relies on that sponsorship for 70 per cent. of its income. That sponsorship is therefore more important for snooker, but formula one got a meeting with the Prime Minister. Why? Could the answer have anything to do with the fabled £1 million donation to the Labour party? [hon. Members: "Oh."] If this had happened a year ago, a Labour Opposition would have asked such questions in much more lurid terms.<br><br>
I want to believe that the Government cannot be bought, but access to them certainly can. Formula one's access to the Prime Minister can be explained only by the fact of that £1 million donation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Publish your donors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party was not going to publish its donors until next November: the list had to be dragged out of it.<br><br>
Other sports representatives finally got a meeting with the Prime Minister on 25 November. After that meeting the president of the World Professional Snooker and Billiards Association issued a press release calling his meeting with the Prime Minister "very positive and constructive". Yet on the same day the Prime Minister met members of the British Medical Association on the same subject. The BMA put exactly the opposite case to him, and in describing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0586">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
the meeting its press release used the same words in the reverse order, calling it "extremely constructive and positive".<br><br>
The Prime Minister has made an art form of his talent for being all things to all people. Even by his standards it is a new achievement to meet two groups on the same day and discuss opposite sides of the same argument, and then to get both of them to describe their meetings as constructive and positive. However, snooker and darts do not enjoy the same objective argument as formula one. That is why they will be disappointed and treated differently.<br><br>
I shall turn now to the question of the meeting with the Prime Minister. Initially, the Government denied that Mr. Ecclestone gave any money to the Labour party. On the Friday of the week in which the decision was announced, the Downing Street press office threatened libel action against reporters daring to couple Mr. Ecclestone with the Labour party. Then it admitted that there had been a donation of just over £5,000 and it stated that details would be published at the time of the next Labour party conference.<br><br>
It turned out that the donation was of £1 million. That is hardly "just over £5,000": in the circumstances, to put it neutrally, it is materially over £5,000. In a parliamentary answer, the Prime Minister admitted that he knew of the donation before he became Prime Minister. However, in another parliamentary answer, the Secretary of State for Health said that neither he nor his Minister of State knew about the donation until 7 November—four days after the decision had been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not giving way.<br><br>
At Prime Minister's questions the week after the problem became public knowledge, the right hon. Gentleman told the Leader of the Opposition that he had written to Sir Patrick Neill to seek approval of the first donation. He was then forced to publish the letter— after it had been leaked—and it was clear that it was not about the first donation at all. It was about the second donation, and I shall waste the Committe's time by reading out that letter if Labour Members do not believe me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am in the middle of a point. The letter asked whether it was all right to receive a second donation. In other words, the Labour party was negotiating with Mr. Ecclestone for a second donation. He did not offer it, as the letter stated. He was approached and asked if he wished to make a donation. At the same time, the Prime Minister was negotiating with Mr. Ecclestone about the formula one directive. The letter's only reference to the first donation is at its end, where it was asked rather casually, as a throw-away question, whether it was all right to keep it. The letter was written after the event and after the facts had been dragged out of the Government, when there was a danger of more of them
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
leaking and when the Government wanted to try to cover their tracks and to obtain clearance from Sir Patrick Neill. That is not what he is there for, and, unfortunately for the Government, he did not given them the clearance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to make his own speech.<br><br>
In an interview on a sunday television programme a couple of weeks later, the Prime Minister said that as soon as the decision was made to exempt formula one, a decision was made not to accept a donation from Mr. Ecclestone, who was informed two days later. Two days after that, the Labour party wrote to Sir Patrick Neill, asking if it would be all right to accept the donation. Again, putting it neutrally, the Prime Minister did not tell us the whole truth. What really happened is clear. I do not want to believe that the Prime Minister's decision was influenced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why is the hon. Gentleman raising it then?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because it is important that Governments do the right thing and that they are seen to do it. There appears to have been a serious impropriety. If the hon. Gentleman cannot see that a party that accepts £1 million from a business man and then changes its—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister was heard in reasonable silence. I appreciate that the issue is contentious, but the Opposition spokesman should also be heard in reasonable silence. When hon. Members try to catch my eye later in the debate, I may deem those who have been speaking from a sedentary position to have already spoken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members cannot see that, on the face of it, there has been a serious impropriety. Even if a decision was not changed as a result of donations, the people in question obtained a meeting with the Prime Minister. Such a meeting was denied to other sports to which tobacco sponsorship is, if anything, more important than it is to formula one. If anybody is trying to pretend seriously that a donation of £1 million to the Labour party was not one of the reasons that those people got that meeting, hon. Members are being asked to believe the totally incredible. The meeting happened and, as a result, the policy has been stood on its head, and the Minister and the Secretary of State have been made to look fools. They have been parodied and ridiculed in the <i>British Medical Journal,</i> in Select Committee reports and by the European Commissioner.<br><br>
I shall now come to the blocking minority on this directive. When the Secretary of State finally broke cover, he put up a smokescreen. He said on the "Today" programme that not just Britain was switching votes—the traditional blocking minority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0587">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
being Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark—and that Britain switching sides would have taken 10 votes. Throughout the deliberations, at least from 1992—and probably from 1989—until the middle of October, that was all that was needed to alter the directive.<br><br>
The Secretary of State now says that it was not only those countries that were involved, but that Austria, too, was part of the blocking minority. That was news to me, and also news to the Austrian Government. I asked somebody to look into the matter and the Austrian Government denied that they were part of the blocking minority.<br><br>
Another smokescreen has been put up. Why have not the Government dealt with the matter openly? Why have they not said that they have changed their minds about formula one? Why have they tried to put up smokescreens so that information has to be dragged out of them? Why have they misled hon. Members about whether Austria was part of the blocking minority?<br><br>
The Minister knows perfectly well that the Government have done that. She submitted two memorandums to the Committee. In the first, Austria is not mentioned as part of the blocking minority, but in the second it is. How extraordinarily convenient that Austria should suddenly have become part of the blocking minority. How very inconvenient for the hon. Lady that Opposition Members took the trouble of checking with the Austrian Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of information—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not have to give way on a point of information. The hon. Lady can make another speech later. The Austrian Government have said to Library researchers that they are not part of the blocking minority. That is the authority for my assertion. If, since writing the letter, the Austrian Government changed their mind about the issue, that would be convenient for the hon. Lady, but they certainly had not when the Secretary of State appeared on the "Today" programme.<br><br>
The development of the directive has been a sorry and shabby affair. Labour Members would realise that, if they had any pride in themselves or in their standards. They have displayed two faults—I think that they will be abiding faults—for all to see: arrogance and bossiness. Their arrogance lies in thinking that the rules do not apply to them; that a big majority means that they can do as they like; that they do not have to be open to Parliament or to the people; and that they can actively mislead and then affect amazement, as the hon. Lady did, that anybody should question such conduct.<br><br>
What about bossiness? The Government are developing a nasty characteristic—they want a nanny state. The Minister fits the role of the nation's nanny rather well. She knows what is good for us better than we do ourselves. But she is no Mary Poppins; there will be no spoonful of sugar with this medicine—it will be taken nasty, cold and straight. We cannot smoke, we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
cannot hunt, we cannot shoot—and if that means trampling on the rights of minorities, too bad. The agenda is even longer: people will not be able to buy cigarettes until they are 18—as though that will make any difference, when 14-year-old kids can buy drugs at the school gate.<br><br>
Apparently, we will not be able to smoke in pubs. What a fatuous idea. Perhaps the Minister thinks that she can stop people drinking in pubs. I am sure that there is a good health reason for that. I only hope that the Minister moves to another job before she moves her attentions to the third most common vice in this country. This is an unpleasant characteristic of the Government and one, in all honesty and objectivity, of which they should be wary. To be known as bossy will not make them popular with the electorate. We all know what is bad for us without sanctimonious lectures from Ministers every week. This whole sorry, shabby episode calls for a verdict. The facts almost, but not quite, justify a verdict of corruption. They will certainly justify a verdict of incompetence and arrogance. I will settle for a verdict somewhere in between the two.<br><br>
I hope that the Government have learnt some lessons from this affair. The public and Parliament have certainly learnt a lot about the true nature of the Government. I am glad about one thing—that this Labour Government will never again be able to ride their high moral horse through the House of Commons.</span></p>
<p>11.56 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never heard such a shabby, hypocritical speech from a Conservative Member in all my life. The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon would not even let anyone intervene. It was an absolute disgrace.<br><br>
The matter is very simple. The Tory party will still not publish its list of donations. It will not come clean. It is trying to smear us in the same way that it has been smeared in the past. What has happened today is appalling. The Government have proposed a policy on banning tobacco advertising which has already begun to make a difference to the number of young people taking up smoking and the health problems that smoking causes. The policy started making a difference after 1 May. My hon. Friend the Minister should be congratulated on what she has done so far. Her treatment by certain sections of the press and the Conservative party has been appalling.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon has now left the Room. When he was joint deputy chairman of the Conservative party and wrote his famous memorandum on the state of the party and its perceptions on policies, he said that health was a bad issue for the Conservatives. Was it considered a bad issue because of the pro-smoking lobby and the fact that the Conservatives have accepted many annual donations from tobacco companies?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister has set up a policy which means working in co-operation with our European partners. Ultimately, it will make a significant difference to smoking in this country and in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0588">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Europe generally. It is not the only part of the policy, but it is an important part, and it deserves support. I certainly support it, as do my hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p>11.55 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to return to a series of interconnected issues that I raised in the form of questions to the Minister, which she was presumably unable to answer. I cannot think that her reason for not answering them was that she had never heard of a regulatory appraisal, for example, which she confused in her answer with "explanatory memorandum". I take it that the hon. Lady was unable to answer was because she did not have adequate answers, rather than not understanding the questions. I should like to lay out the points and repeat my request for a serious answer.<br><br>
The Cabinet Office guidelines on regulatory appraisals are perfectly clear. They state:
<br><blockquote><p>"When dealing with EC legislation, the availability of an Appraisal early on in the process is vital — The appraisal should be updated at all stages in the development of a proposal. An Appraisal needs to be prepared at the same time as the Explanatory Memorandum".</p></blockquote>
As you have already ruled, Mr. Gale, the Committee is being asked to take note not of the relevant version of the directive, but of one that is five years out of date. It is therefore not surprising that when I asked the Minister about the guidelines and the dating of the appraisal, she immediately referred to an explanatory memorandum produced in 1992, contemporaneously with the document of which we are being asked, mistakenly, to take note. She referred to the appraisal conducted within that explanatory memorandum which, unlike the relevant document, was helpfully provided for the Committee. It states, fulfilling in part the requirement for regulatory appraisal:
<br><blockquote><p>"The evidence to justify a total ban on tobacco advertising on health grounds is equivocal".</p></blockquote>
It has been stated that the document was placed in the Vote Office last night. I was in the House until 11 pm. I checked at the Vote Office shortly before 10 pm, but was unable to obtain it. I can only think that someone came in extraordinarily late at night and smuggled the document in or that it arrived this morning. Nevertheless, we have been vouchsafed the regulatory appraisal. I ask the Minister again, at what date was it produced? If it was produced in conformity with the Cabinet Office guidelines it must have been produced at the same time as the explanatory memorandum which relates to an outdated proposal but, nevertheless, one which is five years later in date than the one to which the Committee's attention is being attracted.<br><br>
If the document had been produced at the same time as the explanatory memorandum, it would have been available at the same time as the bundle of documents, but concealed from the Committee purposely. The ultimate explanation is that it was not produced contemporaneously with the explanatory memorandum, in which case the process was not in conformity with the regulatory guidelines provided by the Cabinet office.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
Let us turn to the substance of the matter—we now have this invaluable document before us. The second paragraph of the third page of the regulatory appraisal states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Public estimates are given of approximately £100 million per annum spent on tobacco advertising as a whole".</p></blockquote>
To my understanding, that is the first time that the Government have vouchsafed to the House or to the public a genuine estimate—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if it is not the first time; it is the first time that I have come across it.<br><br>
It is extraordinarily helpful to have the estimate before us. The paragraph continues that £35 million of the £100 million is spent on formula one. The regulatory appraisal informs the Committee that rather more than a third of tobacco advertising expenditure in this country goes on formula one. If the directive in its latest form, which we saw this morning, is implemented, with "X" an unknown quantity of years during which sponsorship and advertising is allowed to continue in formula one, the sport will have a monopoly during that period and be able to raise from rather more than a third to 100 per cent. the proportion of the £100 million spent on tobacco sponsorship.<br><br>
I asked the Minister, when she had the opportunity to do so, to estimate the rise in expenditure on tobacco sponsorship of formula one in this country. That is not stated in the appraisal. I find it extraordinary, even in the light of the document's shabby form and the extraordinarily late date at which, probably in contravention of the guidelines, it has been produced, that the fundamental question has not been assessed.<br><br>
The Minister has argued that the directive, which seems to many of us to be wholly unnecessary legislating by the European Community on the ground that domestic legislation could have been drawn up, will ensure reduced tobacco advertising and sponsorship for the reasons that have been given, at last, in the appraisal. Unless she can argue convincingly that the £35 million will not increase to £100 million, her case is wholly destroyed. If the directive, with the "X" years of derogation included, leads merely to the multiplication by three of Mr. Ecclestone's ability to attract tobacco sponsorship, people in this country will still be subject to the same amount of tobacco advertising and sponsorship as they were previously. It will merely all be devoted to a friend of the Labour party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Minister was unwilling to give way at all. I would usually be perfectly willing to do so, but the precedent on the issue was set by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a small point of information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way if the point is genuine.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0589">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have two points to make. First, the document is dated November 1997. Secondly, the current draft directive makes it clear that derogation would be allowed—for a transition period of "X" years—only under the condition that sponsorship decreases during that time. That would rule out an increase from £35 million to £100 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes one valid point, to which I shall return. I did not assert that the regulatory appraisal was not dated, although the date given—November—is very unspecific. I think that that is intentional, to disguise the fact that it was not produced at the same time as the explanatory memorandum. What is not dated or specified is the period of "X" years.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) is right to point out that paragraph 5.3 of today's version of the directive states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Member States may continue to authorise the existing sponsorship of events … for a further period of X years provided that … the sums devoted to such sponsorship decrease".</p></blockquote>
I agree that that is the intent of the latest version, but the Minister—despite ample opportunity—has not given the slightest hint to the Committee as to why she believes that that is what will happen. Tobacco sponsorship for formula one at present is worth one third of the £100 million. There is nothing in the directive, as there was nothing in the Minister's opening remarks, to lead us to believe that steps will be taken—through domestic legislation or through further directives—to limit the rise in Mr. Ecclestone's splendid revenues from tobacco advertising.<br><br>
If the Minister wishes to defend her case, in Committee and in the wider public arena, she must explain how, using the argument that she has used today, she can bring forward this directive, with this derogation, without accusing herself and her colleagues of a dramatic conflict of interest and of a complete incoherence of policy.</span></p>
<p>12.6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the final point made by the hon. Member for West Dorset. He appears to argue that we shall end up with a time-limited exemption for formula one that is greater than the four and a half years specified in the original directive. If we assume, for the sake of argument, that formula one was to be exempted for a further seven years, it would be absurd, in business terms, for that sport not to seek non-tobacco alternatives for the two and half years after the end of the general exemption. Formula one would know that at the end of the exemption period, it would be legally forced to seek alternatives. Therefore, I think that the hon. Gentleman's contention is spurious.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon largely dealt in smear and innuendo. Labour Members will not take lectures from the Opposition about political donations. We remember clearly how Conservative party officials and even the former Prime Minister scurried around the far east in search of donations of millions of pounds from business men, regardless of their circumstances. We remember the illegal donation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
from Asil Nadir: to this day, that has still to be repaid by the Conservative party to the shareholders who deserve the money back.<br><br>
What a contrast that is with the Labour party's policy. We sought advice on the problem and returned the money to Bernie Ecclestone. It is worth highlighting that contrast. The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon said that the real worry is the appearance, if not the substance, of buying influence. I share that worry, but the Conservative party can deal with that by publishing its accounts and the names of the party's donors. Why, in those circumstances, does not the Conservative party agree to the publication of its accounts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Labour Government are so open, why, on Friday 8 November, were libel writs threatened against any reporter mentioning the name of Bernie Ecclestone in connection with giving money to the Labour party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not an answer to my question. It is an evasion of the central question, namely, why does the Conservative party still refuse to publish the names of its donors? Publication of those names would prevent any apperance of undue influence. Failure to publish will continue to haunt the Conservative party.<br><br>
Much of the debate has focused on donations and the effects of the directive, but we must not lose sight of the fact that tobacco is an addictive drug that leads directly to lung cancer, heart disease and many other forms of preventable disease. It kills 120,000 people in Britain each year—330 people a day. There is no other example of how a change in human behaviour could prevent so many deaths. It has been pointed out that tobacco is the single biggest cause of preventable ill health in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Despite that grave situation, smoking is on the increase. In the last three years for which figures are available, smoking has risen by 9 per cent. among teenage boys and by 7 per cent. among teenage girls. As my hon. Friend the Minister has already pointed out, the 1996 household survey showed that smoking among the general population increased for the first time in 24 years. If current smoking rates persist, smoking will kill about a million of today's teenagers and children in middle age. I find that a shocking and staggering statistic. That is the damage that smoking is doing to young people in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that overwhelming evidence, does my hon. Friend have any idea why the Conservative party is so opposed to the ban?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only speculate, but I think that that is due to the links between the Conservative party and the tobacco industry, to which I alluded earlier, in particular in 1992, when the tobacco industry was happy to collude with the Conservative party and donate poster space to it on an unprecedented basis. That clearly shows why the Conservative party is so sensitive on this issue.<br><br>
The 120,000 deaths each year reduce the market for the tobacco companies so they have to advertise to make up for the business they lose through people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0590">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
dying prematurely. They therefore spend hundreds of millions of pounds a year attempting to attract young people to smoking and to keep them hooked on smoking. That is not only a tragedy for the individuals and families who suffer—the taxpayer must pay the cost of dealing with the consequences. The latest estimates suggest that each year between £1.4 billion and £1.7 billion of health service expenditure goes on preventing and dealing with the consequences of smoking. That sum would significantly help to deal with the problem of NHS waiting lists.<br><br>
In the light of that evidence, there is an absolutely overwhelming imperative for the Government to take action on any moral, ethical, health or financial grounds. That is why I support the directive that my hon. Friend the Minister is proposing and pursuing. The Government, unlike their predecessor, are attempting to take tough action.<br><br>
Even ASH, which is one of the lobbying groups that is supportive of the most stringent measures on this issue, said that even allowing for the issue of formula one, the new Government's policy remains far stronger than anything pursued in Britain before.<br><br>
The White Paper will deal with many of the issues that have been mentioned. I passionately believe that were it not for the change of Government in Britain on 1 May, we would not be having this debate today and we would not have the chance of a broad and comprehensive directive being supported in the European Union. The issue needs to be deal with quickly.<br><br>
I say to my hon. Friend the Minister that although I broadly welcome and support the directive, there are legitimate questions about the exemption for formula one and I hope that in her summing up she will respond to some of them. The issue of formula one is important because there is evidence that boys who are fans of that sport are twice as likely to smoke as those who are not.<br><br>
There are question marks also over the voluntary approach. The proposed voluntary code of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile would, as I understand it, remove tobacco logos only from helmets and tunics, leaving in place trackside and on-car advertising, which is far more important. I would welcome the Minister's comments on that issue.<br><br>
I am concerned also that the tobacco companies have already sidestepped United Kingdom restrictions by using initials and pseudonyms, which are attractive and to which young people are the most susceptible. The body that monitors the United Kingdom voluntary agreement recently ruled in favour of tobacco companies on that issue, so I would welcome the Minister's comments on whether that decision would be affected by a wider, international ban.<br><br>
I accept that this is a complicated issue and that we need to address the wider implications for sport. I welcome the implication of the latest information that we have received, which is that there will be a time-limited exemption for formula one.<br><br>
Finally, I endorse the Government's approach and I wish my hon. Friend the Minister the best possible luck on Thursday, so that after so many years of campaigning we can finally achieve a comprehensive
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
ban. People in this country will recognise that we have achieved it not because of the Conservative party, which has consistently and rigorously opposed any comprehensive ban, but because we have a new Government with a new agenda, who are determined to protect people's health.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are supposed to be discussing the European Community document concerning a proposed ban on tobacco advertising, but we have been talking about two rather different matters.<br><br>
The first is the £1 million that went to the Labour party. Those of us in the minor parties who have watched the exchanges between the two principal contenders in the House have been much amused—it is nice to see the flow going from one side of the House to the other. Long may it continue, because when the two main parties are fighting with each other, they are not troubling us too much. I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell) say that the Labour party took advice and then repaid the money. Is he assuring us that the Labour party now takes advice on every donation that it receives? If that is the general policy, it would be very welcome to Labour supporters and to the country at large.<br><br>
The second issue is whether it is right to ban advertising for tobacco smoking. We all know, and I do not think that anyone would seriously deny, that smoking causes illness and death. Nor would anyone deny that reducing the use of tobacco is a laudable aim. However, the issue is not as black and white as some people claim.<br><br>
Tobacco use is decreasing. Indeed, there is a quote in today's press to the effect that one of our principal tobacco companies has experienced a considerable drop in sales this year. The Minister referred earlier to the drop in the consumption of tobacco in other countries as a result of bans similar to the one that we are discussing. She also said that the United Kingdom had seen an increase last year. Can she tell us what the overall decrease in consumption in the UK has been since, say, 1972? She is bound to have the figures at her fingertips, and we would then know the total drop in the past 25 years. The market has been steadily declining, and I suspect that that drop is considerable, although there might be an unwelcome change in the trend at the moment.<br><br>
If the hon. Lady reads the agreements—which have been adhered to—between Governments and the various tobacco manufacturers, she will know that there have been considerable efforts to diminish tobacco advertising in this country. That may be partly responsible for the drop in consumption. As not even national legislation—never mind European legislation—is necessary, why do the Government not go back to the tobacco companies and seek further agreements with the industry? That would mean a steadily widening ban over time, which might be a more acceptable way in which to proceed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0591">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
The Minister said that the object of the measure was to ban advertising, but that is only half the story. The ultimate objective is to end the consumption of tobacco in this country and, indeed, in the world. That is an interesting policy for any Government or group of Governments to follow. It might mean that once Governments were finished with tobacco, they would turn to other substances, such as alcohol. They could argue that as alcohol causes a great deal of misery, is responsible for much of the death and injury on the roads, causes a great deal of harm to those who consume it to excess and has high charges on the national health service, there is no good reason for not moving towards a ban on advertising it and working for its effective elimination from our society. Humanity has been trying that for a long time, and it has not worked very well. If the Government are adopting the same sort of principle on all harmful substances that they are adopting on tobacco, perhaps they will tell us what else they intend to do. The country deserves to know.<br><br>
We also need to be told how long a period the Government envisage before the consumption of tobacco is eliminated from this country and from Europe. If that is the object, surely to heavens they have worked out a time scale for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not see a difference between Government policy on alcohol and smoking? I think that whatever Government were in power, the policy would be to work towards the elimination of smoking, whereas the policy on alcohol is to work towards the sensible use of alcohol when it comes to consumption or drinking and driving.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I have a great advantage over most people. The only alcohol I drink is the occasional glass of wine. I do not like beer; I hate spirits and would not drink them at all apart from trying a hot whisky if I have the flu—although I do not think that that works very well—and I do not smoke. Therefore, perhaps I can take a more detached view of the issue from those who smoke or drink or both.<br><br>
I remember once watching the Chancellor putting up the taxes on beer, baccy and petrol, as usual. I said that as I was driving a company car at the time and did not drink or smoke, such measures did not hurt me much. I am not sure that my constituents appreciated that remark when it appeared in the local press, but those are the three things that are regularly hit, and we all know it.<br><br>
I assume that the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) drinks the occasional beer and keeps his consumption within reasonable limits. I appreciate that it is not possible to say that about tobacco—there is no point at which it does not, or could not, cause damage.<br><br>
What are the consequences of ending the production of the tobacco industry in this country? There is a considerable price to be paid in employment terms and it bears heavily on Northern Ireland. What alternative forms of employment will be provided?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
The ban on advertising is not the first plank in the elimination of tobacco and smoking. The first plank is tax. How much is the tax take on tobacco this year? Will the Chancellor also examine this year the amount of hand-rolling tobacco that leaves this country one week and appears back in every stall and kiosk within a fortnight? I am told that it is now up to 80 per cent. of the Northern Ireland production and I do not suppose that the proportion is any less in the rest of the United Kingdom, given what is happening in a couple of little villages on the continent.<br><br>
I was not satisfied with the Minister's answer to my question. I believe that if we play around with banning advertising, we need a level playing field. I have a list of sports—the Minister added one or two to it—which are widely played and seen on television in all parts of the world. Every citizen in the country who watches such events on television sees tabacco being advertised. It does not matter whether such advertising relates only to formula one—which is allowed to get the money from advertising here—or to golf or snooker, because advertising can also be seen at such events. They take place in other countries but are broadcast in the United Kingdom and watched by many of our constituents. We do not have a level playing field. That lack of fairness in what the Government are doing concerns me.<br><br>
Then there is the question of alternative sponsorship. One person said to me that the total amount of sponsorship is similar to a little pot out of which everybody gets a spoonful. I prefer to think of it as a pie. Whenever a slice or two is taken out of the available pie less tobacco money, it will be very hard to replace.<br><br>
Smoking will continue for a long term. A brand war is going on all the time, more so than a war about whether people take up smoking. The plain truth is that in that brand war, tobacco and cigarettes produced in the United Kingdom tend to be a premium quality and the best on the market. If all forms of tobacco advertising are done away with, there will be no means of communicating with smokers. The brand war will therefore become increasingly a price war, which will hit the United Kingdom tobacco industry hard.<br><br>
That is the industry's fear, and I share it. The Committee is not discussing a simple, black-and-white issue. It is very complex, and the Government would do far better if they reconsidered it. Banning direct communication with adult smokers is unacceptable. Hon. Members have not been told what influences teenage boys, apart from seeing tobacco advertisements in formula one races. Teenage boys see tobacco advertisements in many other places, and thay have to contend with peer pressure and the example set at home. The Minister should look more carefully at those influences.</span></p>
<p>12.26 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope and anticipate that the amendment will be defeated roundly. I say that because in my opinion, which the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon

endorsed, a litany of political point scoring and anxieties about political donations have taken the place of argument about trying to deal with the chronic social evil of smoking and of advertising smoking products. You have ruled, Mr. Gale, that the argument about political donations is in order. I understand that. I dare to say that I understand why the Opposition have taken that line. It is not, and should not be acceptable, however, to the Committee or to the public, that the Opposition's political arguments and point scoring, and their concerns about donations, should be allowed to camouflage the real issues. The real issue, on which the Opposition's agenda is based, is whether Britain and Europe need a directive at all. It is not acceptable that the Opposition's arguments and political point scoring should be allowed to wreck the vital directive.<br><br>
I was delighted to hear my hon. Friend the Minister say that the Government's position is transitional, and that there is now the possibility of an acceptable compromise on 4 December. I say that sincerely. Anxieties exist about whether an exemption of any sport or any sport sponsorship should be permanent. I understand the Government's negotiating position. Former Conservative Ministers have been questioned on many occasions in the Committee about their negotiating position. As hon. Members have heard, they answered that they could not say anything because it might give the game away. The Government and my hon. Friend the Minister have come forward, however, and stated their negotiating position and the objectives that they are seeking to achieve. However, I say to my hon. Friend that permanent exemptions to the ban on tobacco advertising through sponsordhip should not be one of our long-term objectives, although I repeat that I understand the Government's negotiating position.<br><br>
Secondly, it would be unacceptable to the majority of members of the Committee, but certainly not those on the Conservative Benches, if no progress on the common position were made on 4 December. There must be progress. I was encouraged by what my hon. Friend the Minister said about that. We do not know what the outcome will be—that is in the nature of the beast—but the meeting is important because a further delay of 18 months or more would be unacceptable to many Labour Members.<br><br>
Returning to my initial point, I believe that the true objective of Conservative Members is to wreck the directive because they do not want it now and, as I intend to show in the few minutes available to me, they have never wanted it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon spoke of 1989 as the year in which the issue of the effect of smoking on health and European Union action emerged. That is an important date, but he did not mention that in 1985, at the Milan summit attended by Baroness Thatcher, it was agreed unanimously that there should be a European action programme against cancer and that measures to counter the use of tobacco should be the prime objective. That was agreed to by the then Government.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
In 1990, at a Council meeting on 3 December, member states unanimously came out in favour of full harmonisation on tobacco advertising. It is reasonable, therefore, for members of the Committee to conclude that in 1990 the Conservative Government were in favour of harmonisation on the advertising of tobacco products.<br><br>
What has happened on this extremely important issue since 1985—when those pious, hollow declarations were first made—in terms of European action and a directive? The answer can be summed up in one word—nothing. Nothing has happened except prevarication, obstruction and, some might say, downright political hypocrisy.<br><br>
The 1992 explanatory memorandum has already been referred to by the hon. Member for West Dorset, so obviously I will not go through all of it again. There is no time to do that. Any reasonable reading of the explanatory memorandum, which was issued by the previous Government, leads to the conclusion that they were looking for any possible excuse not to make progress on a directive to ban tobacco advertising. Two examples will suffice to justify that argument. First, the memorandum states that there is a
<br><blockquote><p>"fundamental objection to the Directive as being unnecessary to the completion of the internal market."</p></blockquote>
In other words, having accepted at meetings of the European Council in the 1980s that action was necessary, when it came to taking action, the previous Government changed their minds because they did not want, and never did want, any such action to be taken.<br><br>
The second point at which the explanatory memorandum gives the game away—which has already been referred to by the hon. Member for West Dorset—is where it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The evidence to justify a total ban on tobacco advertising on health grounds is equivocal."</p></blockquote>
That is not what the medical authorities, the National Heart Forum and every respectable, eminent medical opinion believes. I do not believe that the public would accept it either.<br><br>
We have heard a lot of talk about formula one. We have another formula here—the Tory formula. The Tories say that there are no health arguments for the ban or single market arguments for the directive. That equals no action. The Opposition have, in my opinion unreasonably and irresponsibly, argued consistently that no action should be taken. Advertising continues in the forms that are currently available and people are compromising their life chances as a result. I do not know what description you would put on that political position, Mr. Gale, but I put it near to irresponsibility on an historic scale.<br><br>
The real agenda, camouflaged today by political point scoring and personal innuendo, has been with us since the mid 1980s. The Tories are saying, "We do not want our friends in the tobacco industry compromised by a ban that would be part of the directive. We said we did, but we didn't really mean it. We said that we wanted it at successive European Councils, but it doesn't matter that we told untruths because we never meant it in the first place." The 1992 explanatory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0593">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
memorandum is littered with the most puerile excuses that the human mind could construct to find a way not to support what they said they supported in the 1980s.<br><br>
That is the agenda that the Tories want us to accept today. They want to wreck the measure—that has always been their agenda and always will be. Let us show them that we will not be fooled by political prevarication and comouflage. We will make progress, and I wish my hon. Friend the Minister well on making progress on 4 December. The public want it, we want it, the nation wants it and the European Union wants it.</span></p>
<p>12.37 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) has said that the Conservatives sought to wreck the directive. In fact, the Government nearly wrecked the directive—the Social Affairs Commissioner said so in his letter to the Minister. It is obvious that the fuss of the formula one fiasco will dominate the debate—my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon covered that issue adequately—but in wriggling and writhing to get out of the loop that they have created for themselves, the Government have compromised important matters that have not been mentioned.<br><br>
The explanatory memorandum dated 17 November talks of 30 months for implementation followed by 24 months for implementation of the directive's sponsorship provisions. The next draft, which was included in the bundle of papers, spoke of 24 months plus a further 24 months. The paper we received this morning speaks of 18 months plus two years, which will be universal, plus "x" for the special exemptions. In seeking to strike a compromise with other member states and the Commission to wriggle of the hook that they found themselves on, the Government have eroded the time period allowed for implementation to the detriment of all the other affected sports. The Minister's explanatory memorandum talks about four-and-a-half years for other sports to find alternative sponsorship, but she has whittled that down to three-and-a-half years under the smokescreen of the formula one issue.<br><br>
The purpose of this Committee is to scrutinise the detail of the directive. We are in danger of losing sight of some important points. A fundamental question that remains unanswered is whether the matter needs to be dealt with by means of EU legislation. Should it be dealt with under article 100a of the treaty? The Council Legal Service advised in 1993 that it could not be dealt with in that way.<br><br>
What has changed since 1993? What is the reasoning behind the change in legal advice received by the Council of Ministers? A great many of the matters dealt with by the directive are of purely local effect. For example, poster advertising cannot possibly have an impact on the operation of the single market. It is a strictly local problem and the responsibility of national Governments.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
At the other extreme, it could be argued that other factors would be dealt with best by worldwide action, but not by a ban on advertising in the European Union. Despite what has been said about the possible displacement of formula one, television coverage beamed in from around the world of sports events outside the EU will carry advertising for tobacco products.<br><br>
Article 3 uses very worrying terminology. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Member States may permit the sale on their territory of publications containing advertising for tobacco products … where these publications are not principally intended for the Community market."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the use of the word "may" does not suggest that member states might want to start banning international publications because they carry tobacco advertising.<br><br>
We must also consider the derogation being given to member states to plan and implement the details of the requirement covering those non-tobacco products that have brand names and logos similar to those of tobacco products. Such matters will be dealt with at member state level. It is entirely possible that significant barriers will be raised to the operation of the single market in the European Union as member states choose different ways to implement that requirement.<br><br>
Why do we not deal with this problem as a UK matter? That could be done either by strengthening the voluntary code, by UK legislation, or by a combination of both. A stronger voluntary code could be negotiated with the industry, and legislation could be threatened if that proved to be impossible. An important constitutional point is at stake, and a parallel can be drawn with the United States. There, the argument is that the constitutional provisions on inter-state commerce have been used repeatedly to extend the power of the federal Government at the expense of individual states. We must be alert to the danger that inappropriate use of article 100a could cause the same problem in the European Union.<br><br>
There has been a spectacular lack of consultation with those affected by the proposals in the directive—we heard earlier about the late consultation with other sporting bodies that are likely to be affected. Nor has the effect of the directive been quantified properly: we have not been told what percentage of the revenues of various affected sports is made up of tobacco sponsorship. We have heard the figures for formula one—variously £35 million of £100 million—but what percentage of the snooker fraternity's income is made up of tobacco sponsorship?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the hon. Gentleman with some interest. Is he in favour of the directive towards which my hon. Friend the Minister is trying to get European agreement, or does he consider it to be so flawed that agreement is not worth pursuing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to clarify the matter for the hon. Gentleman. I see a number of flaws. First, I question the need for the issue to be dealt with at the European level and wonder whether it could be dealt

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
with better at UK level, either voluntarily or legislatively. I am also trying to draw attention to the fact that the Government's wriggling and writhing over the formula one dilemma has obscured the proper purpose of the debate, which is to consider the specific provisions of the directive and to flag up some of the potential difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt my hon. Friend is well aware of the concept of subsidiarity and the apparent importance that the Government attach to it. Is not the issue a perfect example of where legislation could better be done—if there is a need for it at all—at a local level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point—exactly the point that I am trying to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way because time is short and I must move on.<br><br>
The directive raises freedom of speech issues. Are we to understand that direct mail from outside the European Union will be illegal? Will it be illegal for companies in the United States directly to mail smokers in the United Kingdom or other parts of the European Union? Will mail be intercepted and examined?<br><br>
What will we do about the proliferation of broadcasting from around the world, which cannot be fettered in the way that broadcasting within the EU can? Will not the unintentional effect of the directive be to promote world brands of tobacco at the expense of European brands? People in the European Union will still see advertising—they will be exposed to it in international publications and broadcasting when they travel abroad—but it will be for the great international brand names, principally owned and manufactured in the United States, and not for the European products.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has already been asked whether he is in favour of the directive. Is he—yes or no?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a European directive, I am not in favour of it. I believe that the matter can be better dealt with at the UK level.<br><br>
The Minister said in her explanatory memorandum that there is a blocking minority composed of other countries, for which the relevant issues are different from those that affect the United Kingdom. Is it her understanding that if the United Kingdom finds acceptable the compromise proposed on Thursday, the blocking minority will fall away? Will there then be a majority in favour? Does she know whether the Commission will agree to the presidency's compromise draft? We seem to have no indication about that. If it does not, we will be back to requiring unanimity. If the directive is blocked on Thursday by the blocking minority, will she then consider strengthening the UK voluntary ban, possibly with UK legislation to back it up if necessary, and thus follow a UK route to solving the problem?</span></p>

<p>12.48 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an extraordinarily interesting debate with some marked contrasts between the speeches of my hon. Friends, who argued carefully about how we apply ourselves effectively to reducing the harm that is caused to people in this country by smoking, and Conservative Members, who to a Member failed to address the health issues raised by the directive and the imperative to do something practical and effective to reduce the damage done by smoking. Instead of that, they have played around with petty procedural points, all of which can be answered. Led by the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon, they attempted to sidetrack the debate with the usual sneers and innuendo.<br><br>
The question that hangs in the air as a result—and I shall be happy to give way to the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon to allow him to answer it—is, will the Conservative party declare its donors over the past 10 years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just get on with the directive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There we are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The Minister is clearly going outside any reasonable debate on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will decide that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. It relates to the question of a scrutiny reserve in the light of the Select Committee report. In view of the confusion in which the papers were presented to the Committee and all that has been said, does the Minister accept that there should be a scrutiny reserve in respect of the documents and the meeting on 4 December? The Select Committee will no doubt want to know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that the motion deals only with those issues that are before the Committee this morning. However, if the Minister wishes to respond to the hon. Gentleman, she may.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We note that the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon has declined to come clean about whether—and, indeed, if ever—the Conservative party will declare its donors and sources of funding.<br><br>
I return to the directive, on which Conservative Members have said nothing of substance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. As we have heard, the Tories are against it for a range of confused reasons.<br><br>
I want to deal with an extremely important point—the way in which the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon sought to denigrate the debate, saying that the measure is nannying and bossy. The people of this country do not want Governments who nanny and boss. They would quickly turn their backs on a Government who became intrusive and imposed limits on their freedom, but we must also remember that only Governments can take certain measures. There are a

multitude of ways in which smoking in this country, and among young people in particular, could be reduced, but they rely on a careful balance between protection and the exercise of individual responsibility based on proper information about risk.<br><br>
Governments have a duty to protect. No one else can institute an effective ban on tobacco advertising.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way because we are running out of time.<br><br>
I return to the point that our measures are based on evidence of what works. The evidence from other countries is that if Governments do not legislate to ban tobacco advertising, all other measures to reduce smoking will be ineffective. We are legislating because we want our anti-smoking measures to improve the health of people in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.<br><br>
The test on Thursday is whether, as a result of continued negotiations with our European partners, we can secure first, a ban on advertising that will work in practice, and secondly, sufficient derogation to allow sport to phase out its dependence on tobacco sponsorship, taking particular account of the specific circumstances of formula one as a uniquely global sport. Those talks are beginning to yield a basis on which we can continue to negotiate.<br><br>
We are supported in our approach by the BMA and the other representatives of various health organisations who visited the Prime Minister last week. The Government's approach was described by one as "a breath of fresh air".<br><br>
As Dr. McCara said outside Downing Street, the BMA did not need assurances, as we all shared the same objective—to ban all tobacco advertising and sponsorship from the earliest possible date. They wished to provide support for the Government in their efforts to secure a directive that worked.<br><br>
Let me deal briefly with the problem mentioned by the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon. Austria did not feature in the 1992 explanatory memorandum, because it joined the European Union in 1995; it was therefore not a signatory at that earlier stage.<br><br>
The Cabinet Office guidance has, in my judgment, been entirely met by the submission of papers by the Government in support of the motion. That was another diversionary tactic that added nothing to the substantive debate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
Let me deal with the important points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South. He stressed the importance of continuing with our tough negotiating stance on Thursday to secure a common position that meets our objectives. I give a clear undertaking to the Committee that that is the intention with which I will go to Brussels tomorrow. We remain convinced that an effective ban on tobacco advertising is best delivered on a Europe-wide basis. That is why we will redouble our efforts to secure agreement on the directive.<br><br>
It is very important that we accompany that with a range of other measures to combat and reduce the consumption of tobacco. We have seen a steady decline in the rate at which people smoke, but that decline is now in reverse. For the first time in 25 years, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell) suggested, there is an increase in the rate at which both children and women smoke. It is clear that the previous Government's policy was a failure. They were negligent, and refused to act on the evidence.<br><br>
Let me finish by saying that it is our policy to ban tobacco advertising. It has always been our policy to ban tobacco advertising, but to ensure that such a ban is implemented in a way that safeguards sport, protecting formula one particularly, and the health of people in this country.</span></p>
