	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been brought to my attention that the analogue clock on the rear wall of the Committee Room is somewhat slow. For the benefit of everyone's understanding, I must alert members of the Committee that we shall be proceeding strictly by the digital display on the annunciator and that I shall help as best as I can those who have difficulty seeing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. First, thank you for telling us that the clock is slow. Secondly, on two of my previous appearances before the Committee papers were not in order or were delivered late. I noticed from the papers of today's sitting that a meeting of the Social Affairs Council was due to take place on 2 December — before the Committee has been able to scrutinise the documents. Will you advise me on whether that is correct and on whether the papers are accurate? What is the status of the Social Affairs Council meeting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me. One would expect the relevant documents to be fully available and I shall ensure that inquiries are conducted later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cook, for that ruling. Are we to take it that the Committee is sitting after the Social Affairs Council meeting in Europe? If so, scrutiny of the documentation is entirely unnecessary because decisions will have been taken yesterday. I would, therefore, call for the Committee to be adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me, and I have no information on it. The Minister is, however, anxious to comment on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help the hon. Lady. The meeting to which she refers was postponed from 2 December to 15 December. In fairness, however, the hon. Lady raised a legitimate point of order. Had the meeting taken place yesterday, the Government would have put a reserve on the matter to ensure that the Committee's debate was not undermined by anything that happened then. I thank the hon. Lady for her point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. I thank the Minister for that extremely civil reply. I should, however, draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the Department of Trade and Industry has once again failed to provide the Committee with accurate papers. I was not informed that the meeting of
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
the Social Affairs Council was cancelled and nor, I think, were any of the permanent members of the Committee, or, indeed, you, Mr. Cook. Is that not grossly rude to you and to permanent members of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained that that is not a point of order for me. I must advise the hon. Lady that she has got her points on record. She has done very well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Maclean 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Penrith and The Border)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a different point of order, Mr. Cook. It is important for the Committee and others to note that the Select Committee recommended that three papers could conveniently be taken together today. I wonder, however, whether the Committee or the Government should be slavishly bound to the recommendations of the Select Committee. The three papers under consideration today are immensely important and each deserves separate consideration. It is not good enough for the Government to deal with them in one sitting. When the Standing Committees on European legislation were set up, it was recommended that there could be five such Committees. The Government cannot say that we do not have enough Committees to deal with the legislation. They have ample Members of Parliament and could set up more Committees on European legislation. Important matters such as those before us could then be dealt with separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must advise the Committee that, once again, that is not a point of order for the Chair. In fact, the business under consideration is a direct result of the application of Standing Orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. This is a separate point. I should like your guidance. From discussions with Directorate-General V, I understand that today's meeting of European ambassadors on mainland Europe will discuss two of the directives that the Committee is scrutinising. D-G V officials told my office that agreement would be reached easily today. Has not there been an apparent flouting of the scrutiny procedure? Once again, I ask for an adjournment of the Committee until we can sort out what timetables we are dealing with. I should like an explanation from the Department of Trade and Industry. Its preparation for Committees, particularly the outlining of timetables, is chaotic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, that is not a point of order for the Chair. I must ask hon. Members to be careful of raising further points of order that may be out of order. The Minister gave an explanation which dealt largely with the issue that has just been raised; indeed, the hon. Lady accepted that explanation. Does the Minister want to comment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) were Ministers in the previous Administration. They know that we are following precisely what the previous Administration did to manage business between this Committee, the Scrutiny Committee and Europe. The parliamentary scrutiny reserve on the Council will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
remain until the House of Commons has completed its consideration. We are simply complying with the Standing Orders, which set down the process for debate and respond to the request for the debate to take place this morning—no more and no less than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful. That is most helpful of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first occasion on which I have spoken from the Government side of the Committee and the first time that I have had the pleasure of your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. I hope that over the coming years you remain a Chairman and I remain a Minister and that we can have reasonable discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Scrutiny Committee for selecting for debate the proposal to extend the European works councils and parental leave directives to the United Kingdom and the draft part-time work directive. I welcome the opportunity to discuss these measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The election of the Government marked a fresh start to our relationship with our partners in Europe. One of our first actions was to accept the social chapter, ending the disastrous empty-chair policy of our predecessors, which left the United Kingdom sitting on the sidelines of European discussions and debate. The Government are not prepared to sit on the sidelines. We wish to play a full, constructive part in the development of the European Union and we are playing a leading role in defining a new agenda in Europe in social affairs and employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions are not permitted in the opening statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for protecting me, Mr. Cook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new agenda is based on the recognition that Europe's labour markets need to become more flexible in adapting to ever-more rapid change. With global competition intensifying, we need the flexibility that allows businesses to respond effectively to economic change and which equips people to do a range of jobs as demands vary. To be truly effective and of benefit to all that flexibility must be underpinned by decent minimum standards which balance the needs of business with those of employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister was instrumental in ensuring that the new employment chapter agreed at Amsterdam explicitly recognised the importance of labour market flexibility. More recently, at the November jobs summit, all of the member states committed themselves to a new approach based on competitiveness, employability and labour market reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our acceptance of the social chapter is a crucial part of that agenda. We see the social chapter as an opportunity to implement certain minimum standards to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
which all employees should be entitled. Minimum standards which, provided they are framed correctly, will bring benefits to employees and will help to promote the flexibility that businesses need to compete effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three proposals that the Committee has before it are good examples of that. It is nonsensical to suggest that any of these measures will place excessive burdens on business or damage its competitiveness. They are all flexible and balanced measures that set fair and sensible standards and represent no more than good business practice. For example, the parental leave directive will be crucial in helping people to reconcile their working lives and family responsibilities. The directive will give parents the right to limited unpaid leave following the birth or adoption of a child. It will also give a right to time off for urgent family reasons such as a sudden death or a child being taken seriously ill and having to be hospitalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not, by any stretch of the imagination, seem excessive, particularly when one considers that the estimated cost of the directive to business is only £5 a year for each employee. On the contrary, the measures will bring benefits to parents and their children and, through them, to society and the economy as a whole. By helping individuals to balance work and family, the measures will help to remove barriers to employment and improve the functioning of the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Giving employees decent terms and conditions of employment makes good economic sense. A business that respects its employees and treats them as partners will have a more committed and productive work force. The availability of family-friendly working arrangements such as parental leave can make an important contribution to the achievement of that aim. However, it is equally important to foster a culture of partnership in the workplace itself. Employees who feel involved in their organisation are much more likely to share its goals. The vast majority of leading British companies recognise the need to inform and consult employees about matters that concern them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European works council directive sets down a sensible framework for informing and consulting employees in large multinational companies at a European level. Again, that represents good business practice that will help employees better to understand the context in which they work and help management better to understand the needs and interests of the work force. Of course, the effectiveness of a European works council will depend on a commitment from all those involved, but that commitment will pay dividends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements set up under the directive will contribute to a culture of trust and co-operation between the companies involved and the people who work for them. That can only be good for business. That is not only our view. Many United Kingdom companies already recognise the benefits that the directive can bring and have decided to include their United Kingdom employees in their arrangements. A report published in November by Income Data Services stated that of about 400 companies across Europe which had set up European works councils, only two had not included their United Kingdom employees—so much for the previous Government's opt-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The Government are keen for both the parental leave directive and the European works council directive to be extended to cover the United Kingdom as quickly as is practicable. The two article 100 directives before the Committee represent the most straightforward and legally certain means of achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the third measure that we are debating today—the draft directive on part-time work. The intention is that that measure, too, once adopted, will be extended to the United Kingdom by means of article 100. The directive has two aims: to ensure that part-timers do not receive less favourable terms and conditions than their full-time counterparts and to remove obstacles to part-time work. The directive, as with the other measures under discussion, will have important benefits for employers and employees across Europe. It will make it easier for employers to organise their workplace to suit the requirements of their business and it will make it easier for employees to find work patterns that suit their needs and those of their families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government welcome all these measures. They will help to improve working conditions and living standards and to promote the flexibility of our labour markets and the competitiveness of our business. I hope that I have made clear the context of the three directives and the Government's broad position on the main issues. I shall be happy to answer the Committee's questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.36 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that their questions should be brief and that they should be asked one at a time. If members of the Committee conduct themselves properly, there is likely to be ample opportunity for them all to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At paragraph 24 of the compliance cost assessment the Minister admits that costs will be associated with the measures relating, for example, to sick leave and extra training for part-timers, and that these costs will fall on employers. Will he give us an estimate of the costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The social chapter is not a specific set of legislative proposals or commitments, but a mechanism by which the Council can adopt legislation in a number of aspects of social policy. The Government assess carefully the costs and benefits of proposals, and we will do so in consultations about the final arrangements. After consultation with the social partners, and the resultant proposals, we will assess the costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government believe that flexibility depends on workers feeling protected and secure at work, and on them having skills and legal rights? Does he agree also that that makes them more likely to move job as and when the economy demands? Does that not stand in stark contrast to the Opposition's view, which is based on managers having a right to hire and fire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Government are interested in decent standards and fair
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
treatment at work, and in the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees. The purpose of partnership is to get the best out of an asset—a person working in a company. That is best achieved by cooperation, by involvement in the workplace, by good standards of employment practice and by investment in training, in development and in the skills and knowledge base of employees. It is best achieved by a company culture that involves employees in product development and in where the company is going. Employers have found increasingly that the more that employees are involved in enterprise, the more successful a company becomes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In paragraph 24 of the explanatory memorandum, the Minister admits that he cannot assess the proposals' implications for public expenditure. Will he confirm that he still cannot give a figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said to the hon. Lady that the Government agree in principle to signing up to the three proposals. A consultation process will follow, about the implementation and the specifics of the directives. At that point only will the Government make accurate assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the directives have minuscule requirements in terms of employers and cost. That has been accepted in relation to two of the directives, which came out of a partnership agreement between European employers' and trade union organisations. Two of the directives result from industry asking European politicians to implement them as a more effective way of allowing employability and a fair labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are approaching agreement on the other directive. I have said that the costs for industry are not likely to be large. That is why neither the CBI nor any other organisation that represents industry is climbing up the wall or saying that the directives are anything other than good business practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend comment on the fact that the proposals outline minimum standards, and that many firms offer higher standards? Does he agree that the Government must guard against standards being lowered to the minimum? We are seeking to bring standards up to the same level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals are nothing more than good business practice. That is why business is so exasperated by the Opposition and their old agenda. Business ignored the previous Government when they wanted to opt out of the European works council directive, and told them in no uncertain terms to get lost. Business people said that it was up to them to have good relations with their employees, and that they would build a consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are trying to ensure that business is protected from unfair competition in the labour market that is caused by poor standards. Europe and Britain cannot compete in the world economy by driving down standards of pay, conditions, health and safety or of investment in the skills and technology base of the work force. Everybody in Europe recognises that, whether he or she is an employer or an employee. That is why the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Committee is considering a rights and responsibilities agenda. The Opposition are the only people who are uninvolved. They are light years behind the economy's needs. That is why business no longer listens to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister was not successful in answering my hon. Friend's questions about cost, may I press him on the compliance cost assessment for the parental leave directive? In that assessment, a calculation appears with the basis on which it was made. The basis reinforces the point shown in the calculation that the marginal utility of labour that is assumed is £1.70 per hour. How does that reconcile with the Government's position on a minimum wage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The minimum wage is a completely different issue. The hon. Gentleman's question is really only an attempt to introduce the issue of the minimum wage into the debate. I will welcome the opportunity to debate the issue with him when the National Minimum Wage Bill receives its Second Reading in the near future. I look forward to his explanation of why he supports the concept, in principle, that people should be paid as little as £1, £1.20, £1.30 or £1.40 an hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made it clear to the hon. Lady and other Opposition Members that the exact cost assessment will be part of the process of consultation with our social partners about the implementation of these directives. At the end of that consultation process, we will set out in detail the requirements regarding implementation. Then, and only then, will we be able to produce an accurate cost assessment. It is no more and no less that that. I have been completely open and honest with the Committee on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I believe that the Minister may be unintentionally misleading the Committee. He must be referring to a different document. There is a compliance cost assessment in detail in the parental leave directive, as part of these documents. It was that to which I was referring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a point of argument, not of order. The hon. Gentleman must pursue the matter in the question and answer session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the previous Administration had not opted out of these matters, the consultation process would have taken place, allowing the Government to make assessments. We inherited a shambles from the previous Administration, who refused to co-operate effectively on these matters. They ignored them and opted out of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our first few months in government, we have been required to make assessments of opting in, setting up processes to allow the House of Commons to give proper consideration of that and, following this Committee's consideration, to put in place a consultation process. At the end of that process, the Government will make clear their proposals on implementing the directives. Part of that implementation strategy will be a cost assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My experience was that even while the Conservative party was claiming, during the general
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
election campaign, that the works council directive would bring ruin to them all, most of the companies that met the criteria for it were busily implementing the directive. Have the Department and the Minister undertaken any research to show how far advanced companies' preparations are for the works council directive, irrespective of whether the regulations are agreed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks a more than reasonable question. Business ignored the previous Government's opt-out because their proposal interrupted good working relationships between companies and their employees. So far, about half of those companies which would happily have implemented the directive if the previous Government had done their job properly have now implemented it. The other half are in the process of implementing it and are looking at how best to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eric Nicoli, the chief executive of United Biscuits, said recently in regard to the European, works council directive covering his company:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our objective in setting up a European Works Council in 1994 was to protect our ability to manage change. Now … we believe it has contributed to this."</p></blockquote>
Business supports the introduction of the European works council directive. We believe that the way in which we introduce it will be fair and will maximise the benefit to employers and employees alike.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do the Government always have to pursue the European road to what they regard as progress? The United Kingdom has traditionally been in the van of employment legislation from the Factories Acts to the most recent employment legislation. How is it beneficial to set aside this national approach, which has historically been so successful and has always given Members an opportunity to amend Government legislation and to secure a pattern of law that best accords with our working practices and national traditions? Why are we handing over these important powers to Europe, where we will be subject to qualified majority voting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a bit of a neanderthal when it comes to these matters. He knows that it was the Conservative Government, under Lady Thatcher, who accepted qualified majority voting under the Single European Act because they knew that we needed to co-operate and work in partnership with Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's Conservative Opposition have decided to take a completely different tack. They walk away not only from partnership and co-operation but from the reality of the European Community. For example, the British companies involved in the European works councils have a pan-European and global approach. Their context is not merely the United Kingdom economy; they operate across all the European economies, and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive is important because it goes wider than the simple, narrow nationalism to which the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) referred. It will ensure that employees throughout European enterprise co-operate with management at all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
levels to promote best practice for each company. I cannot understand why the Opposition, if they were serious about implementing good employment standards when in government got rid of all standards of minimum pay and the wages councils. Why did they undermine other aspects of British employment rights?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative record is an opt-out from Europe and from good employment standards in Britain. That is the history of the matter. Conservative Members must accept that we have to co-operate with colleagues in Europe. That means that we must negotiate and commit ourselves to partnership. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood does not want this: he wants Britain's chair to be empty and therefore without influence. The British people rejected that approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question asked by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood surprised me. Does not my hon. Friend agree that 18 years of Conservative Government savagely cut workers' rights, causing us to fall way behind the rest of Europe in terns of standards, protection and welfare at work? Are not the Government now trying to catch up and raise standards for the security of workers and employers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The changing global market means that two matters are of great importance. First, the work force must be skilled and adaptable. People must be able to join the labour market. That market has to be able to respond to change, and it can do that only if the work force is skilled, upskilled and adaptable. Employee skills are the key factor in allowing companies to be flexible in a changing marketplace. That is why companies want to invest in their employees' skills and knowledge base and why they want to improve communications and consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, good employers want minimum standards. They do not want to compete with third-world conditions of poor health and safety, low pay or no pay. They want a level playing field in the labour market. They want to be certain that the Government will require all employers to achieve good standards of employment practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee if I sounded a little odd earlier, Mr. Cook, but now I have kindly been given a cough sweet to ease my throat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to press the Minister further about compliance costs. The Committee's job is to examine the documents, and I should be grateful for a serious answer to a serious question. The Minister's Department presented the figures: they are not a piece of general rhetoric and he has had time to receive briefings on them from his officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall spell out the question in detail. Specific calculations are set out in annex D, which is the compliance cost assessment to the explanatory memorandum on the directive on parental leave. No doubt the Minister has now had time to look at it. The calculations suggest that the cost of parental leave is £1.70 per hour for those who will be on parental leave after a one-year qualifying period. The explanation that is given further on in the text states that £1.70 per hour is used as the basis for the calculation because it represents 20 per cent. of the gross labour cost. That is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
perfectly acceptable figure. However, it assumes that the marginal utility of labour—if the Minister does not understand that piece of economics, let me spell it out: I mean the value of an extra employee to the employer—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister refused to answer the question before—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been quite lenient with the hon. Gentleman's style and I am happy to continue to be lenient, but not if he carries on in his present vein. Will he please get to his question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cook. The question is this: how can the Minister justify the document's calculations being based on a marginal utility of labour of £1.70 in the light of the Government's assertion that the marginal utility of labour is much higher than that—high enough to justify a minimum wage? That is a straightforward question about the compliance cost assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I made it clear. I shall stick to the point that I made at the outset. The final compliance cost assessment will come out of the consultation process and decisions on the final arrangements. The hon. Gentleman is trying spuriously to introduce an hourly rate based on what he believes may be the aggregate rate for a national minimum wage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. It is not spurious to quote the Minister's own figures from the document that he signed and sent to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to that point of order, perhaps I should advise the Committee that although this is my first Committee on European legislation, it is by no means my first sitting as Chairman. I remind all right hon. and hon. Members that points of argument are not points of order. We now have about 34 minutes of question and answer left, followed by 74 minutes of debate. Most of us are experienced and I expect Committee members to conduct themselves in compliance with the normal rules of procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. It is not a spurious point of order, but a genuine one—I need your guidance. We have just heard from the Minister a statement that has effectively blown the cost compliance assessments out of the water. Is it in order for the Committee to continue to scrutinise documents that the Minister has admitted are inaccurate and incomplete? I would appreciate your guidance, Mr. Cook.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the hon. Lady my guidance. I have not heard the Minister admit anything to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must again advise members of the Committee that there are 34 minutes of question and answer left and then 74 minutes of debate. Let us get on with the business in hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been trying to be kind to the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin). The directive refers not to wage costs but marginal costs—extra replacement costs. As I said, the proposals reflect that. There is no inaccuracy in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
document. The hon. Gentleman fails to understand that the directive relates to unpaid leave, not paid leave. It is not an assessment of income, but an assessment of marginal costs in relation to the provision, no more and no less. The hon. Gentleman is making a spurious attempt to introduce the issue of a national minimum wage. I have been polite to him until now, but he just does not understand the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that far from imposing stringent costs and burdens on business, for the most of the companies affected—as was said earlier—the directive will simply mean putting into action good business practice? The sad reality is that over the past 18 years or so, the Conservatives chose to opt out of Europe's social dimension and, now that they are in opposition, it appears that they are intent on opting out of reality itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directives are about decent standards, fair treatment in the workplace and good business practice. That is why business wants to cooperate with their implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parental leave directive and the directive on part-time workers are made up of proposals that come from business and jointly from business and employee organisations. They are not the result of employers being forced to take account of decisions taken by politicians. Business has come to politicians and to the political process to say that it wants to make businesses and the labour market more efficient, and wants to adopt a co-operative style of management and partnership with employees to ensure that companies succeed in the marketplace. The directives are about no more or less than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directives will also ensure clarity so that employers do not incur costs. For example, the directive on minimum standards for part-time work will provide clarity for employers. It will mean that they will not have to face potential charges that they have discriminated against some of their female employees. They will be provided with a defence against unfair attacks that they are treating their female part-time staff differently from the rest of the work force. In that respect, the directive will potentially save employers significant sums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the directives, which have the support of business, is to promote flexibility in the labour market and competitiveness. With the promotion of competitiveness, they will ensure good practice in the workplace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not seem to have a grip on the financial aspects of the documents that he has placed before the Committee. Will he read article 5 of the directive on works councils and tell the Committee what budgetary rules he will lay down regarding the operation of the special negotiating body? Will he limit the funding to cover one expert only? Will he answer these questions now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is trying to get a horse running, but it just does not want to run. She has
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
put up an old nag, I understand why the Opposition have done that; we all do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made it absolutely clear in the documents—and following on from the documents—that, in the consultation process and as we come to our conclusions on the implementation of the strategy, we will ensure—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I have made this clear; I have said it four or five times already. The details will be considered as part of the consultation process. It will involve no more or no less than that. That is exactly what the previous Government did when they implemented legislation, and that is the example that we shall follow. It is clear and simple. Through the consultation process, we shall come forward with proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend have any research findings that show how many full-time jobs, which enjoy currently employment rights, have been made part-time jobs because part-time jobs do not enjoy the protections that these directives will introduce? Does he have any findings that show how many people have been exploited in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have any specific research in front of me. However, the Department has a hotline for those who work in the agency sector. The hotline is provided free of charge and, to be fair to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), it was originally established by the previous Government because of a series of complaints that had been made about poor employment practices. We have received more than 10,000 complaints so far from the employees. They cover issues such as the non-payment of wages, failure to be given contracts of employment and a range of other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have talked to the agency sector and it has made it clear that it wants to co-operate in trying to improve standards across the industry. Some members of the industry have been shocked themselves by some of the tactics deployed and by poor management practice. Those complaints form part of the evidence that we have been able to gather on poor employment practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that the Minister completely misunderstood my previous question? My attitude is not based on the idea that the United Kingdom should compete to achieve poor working conditions like those in third-world countries. It is based on the view that we should have the flexibility and employment practices that have enabled us to compete so effectively. Conditions of employment and remuneration in this country are second to none.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the Minister always go down the European road? Would it not be better for the House of Commons to have, literally, days to debate the appropriate legislation and to amend it, than for these proposals to be railroaded through at a European level, with two and a half hours of debate and no possibility of amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had got his skates on during the previous Parliament, the proposals would have been implemented. He cannot tell me that I am not doing my job and am not quick enough off the mark. Labour Members were desperate to implement the proposals, but we had to wait for the British people to give their electoral consent. That is the reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Inside or outside the Community, if we want a flexible labour market, what should we provide? First, we must provide skills, investment in skills, training, upskilling, reskilling, a knowledge of the company and an understanding of why it needs to move into new products or change its market focus. That means consultation with the work force. There is no point in having a work force who are ignorant of the job that they have to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we must provide good communications. Consultation cannot take place without them. Companies must invest in communications, and that means people working together. Most work forces still operate as a team, with co-operation across the enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, companies need a good customer focus, because they have to sell their products to survive. That means having good supply-chain mechanisms in the marketplace. How can those be provided? The answer is by investment in regional employment structures and skills structures and by ensuring that there is no skill shortage. What have we inherited—skills shortages across the economy. Why? Because the previous Government disinvested in skills, ran down pay and conditions, introduced bogus self-employment in the construction industry and, though their economic policies, brought that industry to its knees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government inherited that, but we have started the process of change. The first thing that we did—and we did not need Europe to do it—was to invest £3.5 billion in skills and training. That was the largest investment of any Government in skills and training. We went further than that. We got our European partners to agree to a job summit, and at that summit Europe committed itself to the same investment package that we have in Britain: investment in the employability of our labour force. That will help us to achieve the competitiveness and flexibility that we need to survive in global markets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. Friend for confirmation of the two aspects to the parental leave directive. The first is about parental leave when a child is born, and that seems clear. The second refers to time off for urgent family reasons. Those reasons are sometimes crucial. The Select Committee report refers to entitlement to time off for urgent family reasons as likely to be more significant than the parental leave measures. Will my hon. Friend confirm that that second aspect will be treated as seriously, under the directive, as time off when a child is born, and that it will not be diluted in discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The social partners agreed to that. They considered serious family illness and accidents. The purpose of the partnership approach was to identify the circumstances in which employees needed urgent time off. That applies to employers, by the way; management also needs such provisions. Unfortunately, managers' children become ill just like anyone else's children, or accidents take place. That thread goes through the proposal and it is commonly accepted. There will be no attempt to dilute that concept, which was presented to us by employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give us a categorical assurance that the works councils directive will not be extended to companies with more than 50 employees, as was reported in yesterday's 	<i>The Independent</i>? There are many such small companies. Will the Minister oppose any extension of the works councils to them—yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The works councils directive is pan-European. It deals specifically with European companies, and it is clear. The hon. Lady has not raised the only relevant issue. Consultations are taking place in Europe about the sectors that are not currently included in the working time directive, and that consultation process is ongoing. At the end of it, Governments will consider whether it is appropriate to extend the directive to those sectors that are not included, such as transport and the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question put by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham is an old nag which, try as the hon. Lady might, just cannot he made to run. The Opposition have no ideas and nothing positive to contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the Minister is not giving an assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Lady any more certainty. The directive is clearly designed to apply to pan-European companies with 1,000 employees across Europe. That is all. The only other discussion that is taking place is about whether a range of other sectors should be included. The Commission is now engaged in consultation. At the end of the process the Community will consider whether those sectors should be included on the same basis as those already affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I detect some disingenuousness in Opposition Members' comments, because yesterday, in the debate on tobacco advertising, and today, their argument seems to be that measures should be passed not at European level but through the United Kingdom system of legislation. Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that there is no evidence that Opposition Members would support such measures in the United Kingdom and that the debate is really about their opposition to any restriction on employers' rights to exploit employees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, but the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham has also mixed up the agenda. I think—though I am not certain—that I know what she was on about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has his note now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not need a note. I know what I am doing. That is why I am on the Government Front Bench and the hon. Lady is on the Opposition Front Bench At last we have a Government who know what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to help the hon. Lady. I thought that she was getting mixed up over the works councils directive and the consultation about information at national level. I am now a little confused. I thought that I had answered the question about the European works councils
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
directive. I also responded to further questions and answered with reference to the directive and possible changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Lady's question was simply about the European works council, I have answered it. If not, what was it about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Mr. Cook. The Minister is supposed to be answering a question from one of his hon. Friends. He should not be addressing questions to my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to allow a fairly complex issue to be discussed in a reasonable way, rather than within strict procedure. If the Committee would prefer me to adopt strict procedure, we shall go back about 40 minutes an start all over again. I do not want to have to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must explain to the hon. Gentleman, who has made another bogus point of order, that the Minister was, as I thought, trying to respond to comments made by Opposition Members from a sedentary position on the Front Bench. That is part of the normal give and take of debate, unless hon. Members are going strictly by the book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now losing time on questions and answers. The more time that we spend on explanations of my style of chairmanship, the less time there will be to question the Minister. Please will hon. Members put clear, brief questions one at a time. Let us get on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall put the matter on record, just in case the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham is not clear about it. I think that she got two matters mixed up. She was really talking about the Commission's consultations on information at national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That matter is only at the stage of Commission consultations. There is no concrete legislative proposal. The Government are not convinced of the need for additional European legislation on information and consultation arrangements within companies that operate in one member state only. Such legislation would risk cutting across existing United Kingdom practice and the Government's own proposals on recognition. However, we shall await the social partners' response with interest. I note that employers' organisations do not consider European-level action appropriate in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have given an answer on all three points: the European works councils directive; its potental extension; and the consultation issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister about the use of article 100 as the legal basis for introducing into the UK the works councils directive and the parental leave directive? Does he not recognise that he is setting a dangerous precedent? I realise that it is a device rapidly to bring about the involvement of the UK before the Amsterdam treaty is completed. However, article 100 deals with matters that directly affect the functioning of the Common Market, and I cannot see
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
how the parental leave directive, when applied to the UK, can directly affect the functioning of the Common Market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. At last a Conservative Member has asked a fair and straightforward question. We had to consider that matter and we decided that article 100 provided the most straightforward, legally certain route to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two main alternatives were considered—a separate protocol attached to the treaty or readoption of each measure under article 100. A separate protocol would have required ratification by each of 15 member states. That could have taken two or more years and caused considerable uncertainty regarding the time scale for extension. It would have been over-complicated and would have re-opened discussions on the substance of the measure. That is why we decided to adopt the directives as the most efficient way of implementing our clear electoral commitment to sign the social chapter and implement its proposals in co-operation and consultation with out social partners. All our European partners agreed that the article 100 route was the most effective way of proceeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend the Minister a question about costs? Conservative Members have a narrow-minded view of costs, but are not some of the benefits difficult to quantify in terms of cost? If employees of a company are happy and satisfied working as part of a team, feel valued by their employer, and have basic minimum standards at work, are they not likely to work better and thereby help their companies to make higher profits? Costs are cut and companies make more money. Surely we should welcome that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a simple one-line answer: a happy work force is a profitable work force. Improving labour market arrangements will enhance competitiveness. That is why employers as well as employees supported the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to his previous response to my question? He did not answer the crux of it—that he is creating a dangerous precedent by grabbing the most convenient article to bring measures into force, regardless of whether the article is properly applicable. Could not that approach be used in future to extend the competence of the Union in an unacceptable way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's premise. We are not trying to extend competence, but to ensure an appropriate legal basis for implementing our proposals. It is as straightforward and simple as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said that these matters have not been adequately debated. However, my recollection is that a large part of the general election campaign was fought over the social chapter. At that time, the only regulations in the social chapter were precisely the proposals before us today. Far from not having been debated, the proposals were extensively debated during the election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We did debate the social chapter during the election—but it was usually a debate between the two Conservative parties rather than between the main political parties, and among the general public. My hon. Friend is correct in saying that we made a commitment to implement the social chapter at the first meeting of the nations following the general election. We did precisely that and we are now in the process of implementing it. It will benefit thousands of companies and their employees throughout the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the Minister yet again on the question to which I still seek a genuine and serious answer. Footnote 20 to annex D of the compliance cost assessment refers to the perfectly reputable work of Davies and Teasdale, with which the Minister and his officials are no doubt thoroughly familiar. The footnote specifically states that employee absences result in either extra effort for others or "poorer standards of service".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does not the Minister accept that the compliance cost assessment in effect states that, in the case of unpaid leave, the figure of £1.70 represents a marginal loss of utility to the company in terms of poorer service or goods? Does he also accept that the £1.70 figure was supplied by the Government to the Committee as an assessment of the marginal utility of labour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered that question already. When the consultations take place about the directive's structure, we shall ensure that there is flexibility for employers to deal with employees' time off in a fair and reasonable way. The directive will cover time off that is taken over a period, or between agreed dates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers will also have the right to say yes or no when a number of employees seek time off between the same dates. Employers will also be given a great deal of flexibility about the timing of a parental leave. The purpose of the consultation process is to ensure the implementation of the directive by common agreement between employers and employees in the context of a company's needs at a particular time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset questions the concept on which the directive is based and has returned to a question that I answered specifically and fully some time ago. The hon. Gentleman's question really covers the implementation of the directive. The consultation process will make it clear that employers will have the flexibility to ensure that employee leave does not disrupt a company's operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend comment on article 3 of the part-time directive, which deals with racism, xenophobia and antisemitism at work? What is the extent of such activities in the workplace? How will the article help in building on national legislation to tackle what many hon. Members consider to be a serious problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directive does not mention that problem specifically. However, the Government's commitment to policies promoting racial harmony in the workplace is clear. We are committed to policies
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
that promote good practice in the workplace; those policies also cover sexual harrassment and other matters. The burden-of-proof directive proves our commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment is responsible for such matters and has been working closely with employer organisations at national and regional level. A great deal of effort is being made to promote good practice. All good employers want to participate in programmes to ensure that their work forces reflect society as a whole. There is no place for racism or xenophobia at work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the parental leave directive will present special problems to very small companies? He has talked about the consultation process and has referred to the various pan European bodies, the so-called social partners, that have been involved. However, they tend to represent large employers. I have in mind companies that do not employ as many as 200 or even 100 people: the ones that I am thinking of employ 10 people, or five, or 15. Those companies will be seriously affected by the parental leave directive. Does the Minister have specific ideas of how small firms will be protected when the directive is implemented into national legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks a fair question. As I told my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker), the directive will recognise that small firms sometimes will find implementation more difficult than larger businesses. It will allow specific flexibilities, such as postponing the time of parental leave when the employer can justify it. Consideration will be given to small firms in such matters. The purpose of the consultation is to consider carefully the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. At the end of the consultation, we shall ensure that the practical difficulties that small companies will face will be reflected in the final consideration. The whole purpose of consultation with industry is to ensure that we have an effective set of proposals on the implementation of the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many small companies around. Some questions asked in this place about small companies seem to suggest that they opt out of good standards. The truth is, however, that huge numbers of small companies are very good employers and want to remain so. They already provide the facilities that we are debating. The vast majority of small companies in Britain give part-time workers rights that they do not have because they want to be good employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small businesses want to be certain that they are not being undercut in the labour market by other small businesses that do not provide good standards of employment. That is why, in the main, they want to work positively with the Government on minimum standards. For the life of me, I cannot understand why people who make proposals affecting small businesses do not always precede them with the caveat that the overwhelming majority of small businesses are good employers and want good employment practice. They want to give their employees the same rights, whether they work part time or full time. On that basis, I believe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
that the directive will be implemented sympathetically and will get the support of the overwhelming majority of small businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the excellent question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)? He mentioned the position of the Conservative party before and during the general election. It is interesting that we have heard a lot about Conservatives wanting to see whether we scrutinise the proposals. The position of Conservative Members on the proposals was, however, made clear before and during the election. Does my hon. Friend agree that Conservative Members are not serious about scrutiny, but want to wreck proceedings and raise spurious points? Is it not true that they are opposed to the proposals, to good employment practice and to good employers? They would rather return to the position before the election, when they encouraged poor employment practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend saw that in tooth and claw in the debate on the Floor of the House on Monday night. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, her hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench and Conservative Back Benchers spent two or so hours supporting low pay and refusing to accept the concept that employers should consult their employees. They refused to accept the concept of employers being obliged to sit down and discuss how they invest in training and skills in the workplace. They oppose the £3.5 billion investment programme in skills and training, which is the biggest ever to be introduced in the United Kingdom. You name it: the hon. Lady and her cohorts are totally opposed to any progressive measure that is discussed in the House or outside with business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the same old Tory party with the same old agenda. That is why industry is just not interested in talking to the Conservatives any more. They are so out of touch with what has to happen in terms of our economic performance that they are not even worth listening to any more. We have heard it all before—their words are a parrot cry in the wilderness. The Conservatives will remain in the wilderness for a long time—until they realise that Britain can go forward only on the basis of partnership and investment skills in the work force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say, Mr. Cook, that I sometimes think that the Minister and his hon. Friends do not live in the real world? Is not it the case that the parental leave directive could be subject to wide abuse? On the question of fathers' leave of absence to be present at the birth of a child, everyone would wish for a happy family at home and at work. In those circumstances, a good employer would always be flexible. Three months could, however, be ludicrous. What would the mother-in-law think about the father hanging around and being a nuisance? Such a provision might be abused and people might go off fishing or gardening. Is this not a typical case of the inflexibility of the European approach? if the measure went through the House in the normal course of events, detailed
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
amendments could be made to ensure that it accorded with the majority will and also with the reality of everyday life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentlemen has the bottle to be at the birth of a child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come off it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a joke. I went through the experience and almost fainted. I needed some time off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made it clear time and again that the leave is upaid. It could be taken over a period up to the birth date, perhaps two days here or there. It could be totted up or taken in a chunk, but by agreement between an employer and an employee. The measure is a mechanism for agreement. Leave could be taken over a range of periods and when necessary, for example if a child was sick or a premature birth meant that more time was needed. There could be a range of circumstances. I cannot think of an employer who would not bend over backwards to assist his employees in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has once again allowed his anti-European prejudices to overturn common sense. His fears about the implementation of the directive are groundless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his answer to my question about the particular position of small firms. Can he assure us that during the consultations he will ensure that small firms are represented in accordance with their weight in the economy, which is considerable, and are not merely given nominal representation, as they have on the Low Pay Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not rise to that silly last point. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] All right, I shall deal with it. The fact is that small and medium-sized enterprises are represented across the Low Pay Commission by a skills and knowledge base. The reality is that the commission has had nothing but praise heaped upon it by the CBI and the Institute of Directors for its work load and activities. Here is a fact for the hon. Gentleman: Unison and the Institute of Directors agree on the membership of the Low Pay Commission. Have you, Mr. Cook, ever heard of them agreeing about anything? They agree about the Low Pay Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's purpose is to engage in a partnership with businesses across the economy, including the most important sector—small and medium-sized enterprises. That is why there is a place at the table for small businesses when we are discussing every' Government policy or preparing legislation. The Department has an open-door policy. Any day of the week, hon. Members could fall over the representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises who are meeting officials and Ministers. We have an active, continuing relationship and, unlike the hon. Gentleman, we value it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham only last weekend had humiliatingly to apologise in the 	<i>Sunday Times</i> for her party's lack of commitment to, and policies for, small businesses; indeed, she said that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
they had got it all wrong in government. As a consequence of getting it wrong, tens of thousands of small businesses do not exist any more. The Conservative party drove them out of business and tens of thousands of good jobs were lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order: That brings us to the end of questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of the European Community Document No. 10230/97 on a proposal for a directive on part-time work and the European Community Document No. 10975/97 Parts A and B on proposals for directives extending the European Works Councils Directive and the Parental Leave Directive to the United Kingdom; and supports the Government's view that these proposals will contribute to a flexible labour market based on partnership between employers and employees and decent minimum standards at work.—[	<i>Mr. Ian McCartney.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to discuss more broadly than was possible during questions the centrepiece of the debate—or what should be the debate—about the parental leave directive. I preface my remarks with two points with which many Labour Members might agree. First, I note that for, I think, the fifth time, the Liberal Democrats are not represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many members of the Committee will agree with the second and more serious point. When we scrutinise such a serious proposal in the face of weighty documentation from the Government—I am grateful that the documents have been vouchsafed at a reasonable date—it is not beneficial to turn the debate into party political slanging match. I have tried, through points of order, to make the point that there is something wrong with the structure of the Committee, but my points were ruled to be not a matter for the Chair. But this is a matter for the House and for the Committee. I hope that we shall achieve some consensus on the problem that the Committee faces in scrutinising such legislation, which is that when questions are asked, the matter too easily becomes party political.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the point of substance. I suspect that the Minister would agree that the parental leave directive would not be necessary if all good employers—those who are rationally looking after their own interests would do this in any case—granted three months or more of unpaid parental leave. There would be no justification for the directive in terms of the criteria set out for European or domestic legislation if employers already granted precisely the rights commanded by the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must follow that the directive will impose on some employers conditions that may be beneficial to the work force—I fully acknowledge that Labour Members regard them as such and we are not debating that point today—but which employers will regard as a cost to them. Costs to employers are important because they have an effect on competition. I can give a partial answer to the questions of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), which the Minister did not answer: part of the justification for a Europe-wide directive is to avoid what would be regarded in certain European circles as unfair competition on the part of those jurisdictions that did
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
not impose those costs on employers. That would permit employers in those jurisdictions to be more competitive than others in Europe. Many Conservative Members would regard the policy as mistaken because we do not believe that such competition is unfair, nor do we believe that the policy would rescue Europe from competition from outside entities and enterprises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall lay aside that argument in the cause of trying to understand the directive. Let us assume that it is justified for the directive to impose extra cost on employers to the benefit of employees, by requiring employers who would not otherwise have done so to grant parental leave. I understand that that is the starting point for the Government's explanatory memorandum and compliance cost assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is up to the Minister to tell us whether that premise is wrong, but I take it that the actual cost to British employers is a matter of great moment to him. The compliance cost assessment, contrary to the Minister's repeated assertions, describes in detail the Department's consideration of that matter. I am grateful for that perfectly rational assessment. It is detailed and relies on a respectable economic text, although it is one with which I do not wholly agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of cost, is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that there should be no cost at all, and that if there is a cost, we should rule out the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. His question will permit me to explain more clearly than I have been able to my aim in making these remarks. I understand that from his point of view and that of his hon. Friends it is legitimate to impose a cost. I am not debating that, but if in their opinion that cost is legitimate, it must also be a matter of concern what that cost will be. There must be some relationship between legitimacy and the amount of cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I asked a specific question. Does the hon. Gentleman think that if there will be a cost, however much it will be, we should not adopt the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As it happens, I do not think, for reasons advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham, that we should adopt the directive—cost or no cost. I am laying that aside and giving that part of the argument to Labour Members. I am trying to pursue what I understand to be the business of the Committee, which is to interrogate Ministers on the assumption that the directive is favoured by Her Majesty's Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants me to say yes or no, my answer is yes, I agree that we should not proceed with the directive, whether or not there will be a cost, and a fortiori if there will he a cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is now satisfied with my response, I shall return to my point: I grant him that his view and that of the Government on the matter is different from mine. I am arguing that the Government have presented a view of cost that ought to be matter of concern to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us try to clarify this, as it is fundamental to the debate. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that there are no circumstances whatever, whether under European or UK legislation, in which an additional social cost would be justified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Let me try to respond to that question, too. I am not saying that. I believe that if the costs were sufficiently modest, domestic legislation would be justified. I do not believe, for other reasons, that Europe-wide legislation is justified. I am not, however, trying to make that debating point now. I am arguing that even if, as Labour Members believe, a Europe-wide directive is justified under certain conditions and costs, there is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that the Minister seemed to think that I was not making a worthwhile point. It is a straightforward matter. We are talking about unpaid leave. When it is granted to a particular employee, there are various possible responses on the employer's part. He may have too many employees already—he is therefore, in labour terms, inefficient. The study that is referred to, Davies and Teasdale, suggests that that is often the case and that the absence of a particular employee simply leads to an increased strain on other employees. That is indeed a prevalent pattern in many parts of British industry, but less so today than it used to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The labour productivity of British industry has much increased. There are far fewer inefficient firms with large pools of surplus labour than there used to be, but I grant that there are some. In those cases, the cost of an absent employee cannot be £1.70 per hour. It must be zero, because where other employees take the strain and there is no noticeable effect on service or goods, there is no cost. However, that is not the figure that is presented in the compliance cost assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the figure provided is for the marginal costs of additional administration. For example, there would be a cost if an employer had to look for a new employee. The figure of £1.70 relates to that. It does not relate to wage costs, but is simply an assessment of the additional administrative burdens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said at the outset—I apologise if I rushed through my speech and the hon. Gentleman did not catch it—that the directive would add an average cost of £5 a year per employee. I therefore gave two figures in relation to the Government's estimate in advance of the consultation. The figure of £1.70 is no more and no less than the marginal cost to employers in certain circumstances if they have to undertake administrative activites because of allowing an employee parental leave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I ask him, however, to look again at his compliance cost assessment, because that is not the argument made therein. It argues that the administrative costs are relatively trivial and states that the £1.70 arises from
	<br><blockquote><p>"the lost profit or the premium paid to replacement labour".</p></blockquote>
The document is clear. A footnote adds that the two causes of the £1.70 could be the absence resulting in extra effort from colleagues, or poorer standards of service. As I said, the former must be zero, so the latter must be the cause of the £1.70.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
I accept the proposition that in many cases, parental leave will lead to a reduction in production. In the manufacturing industry, that means fewer or lower quality goods and in the service industry, fewer services or lower quality service. If, however, one accepts that proposition, which is based on Davies and Teasdale and reflected in the document, and if one further accepts, as the Government accept, that the cost of that poorer service or the reduction in goods is £1.70 per hour, one is stating, and the Government are stating, that the marginal utility of labour—not the average utility, but the loss to the firm of having one fewer labourer—is £1.70 per hour. If the Government genuinely believe that that is the case, the compliance cost assessment is perfectly fair. If they genuinely believe that the marginal utility of labour is £1.70 per hour, they should convey that news to the Low Pay Commission. There is a huge link between the question of a minimum wage and the marginal utility of labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that Labour Members are leaping to their feet—I concede to them that I believe that the Government view the marginal utility of labour is being £1.70 per hour, but I do not believe that it is their view. I give them credit for believing, as I do, that the marginal utility of labour in the United Kingdom is much more than £1.70 per hour. Every hon. Member on the Conservative Benches, here and in the House, would agree that it is more than that. Why does the logic of the compliance cost assessment depend on the assertion that £1.70 is the figure for the marginal utility of labour?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise that point not merely because that assertion vitiates the compliance cost assessment, important though that is. I raise it because it shows something important about how Departments of State, especially the Minister's Department of Trade and Industry—and not just in the present Government—produce explanatory memorandums and compliance cost assessments, and about how they proceed with European legislation. That is a matter of great moment to the Committee. A no doubt intelligent and reputable person has been set the task of producing a compliance cost assessment that contains the lowest imaginable figures, so that the directive goes through the Committee with the minimum of bother.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that while the Minister is quoting an average cost of £5 per employee, which may be disputed, there is little doubt that the real cost for small firms will be substantially higher? Those firms will have fewer opportunities to absorb additional work to cover an absent employee because they have a smaller base of employees over which to spread that work. The administrative cost per employee of compliance with the directive will be significantly greater in small firms than in large firms. Compliance will cost small firms more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been more helpful if the Government had prepared their compliance cost assessment to show the compliance costs per employee for different sizes of enterprise, rather than to show an average for the whole of industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is, of course, right. Any such figure involves a massive averaging. Neither of us
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
have the exact distributions to hand, but he must be right that in a small firm, giving extra responsibility to people when a colleague goes off on leave—one of the categories mentioned—is much more difficult than it would be in a larger firm. An extreme example is that if, in a small grocery store, one person goes on leave, it would be unimaginable to give 50 per cent. extra of the entire labour effort to a remaining employee. Another employee would have to be taken on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency and no doubt in those of many Labour Members, the remaining rigidities of the British labour market will in many cases mean extreme difficulty for small firms seeking to hire competent help, even for a short period, to replace a person. That may lead to a de-averaging of the £1.70 figure—if it were correct—to a point at which multiples of three, four or five may apply in small firms. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. I did not expect him to stop in mid flow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has my hon. Friend looked at the impact assessment form? Does he agree that it is insulting that the Opposition have been presented with a paper that states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What will business have to do to comply with the proposal?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The enterprises have several options to make up for the absence of workers on parental leave, the main being as follows: hiring of replacements; sharing of the work between colleagues; postponing work until the persons concerned return to work"?</p></blockquote>
Is that not a pathetic statement to find in an impact assessment form? It totally underestimates the difficulties that will be faced by small and medium-sized companies which, by postponing work until the persons concerned return, could lose their entire business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The point that she has made is the nub of the matter. The compliance cost assessment and the impact assessment documents both betray a certain lack of seriousness. They do not investigate the fine grain of the multitudinous variety within British industry and services. As a result, they fail to capture the differentiated cost for different classes of manufacturer, retailer and service provider across the economy. They are not even intended to do so. I believe that they have been produced in a rush with a view to justifying a low figure and trying to persuade the Committee that there is nothing to worry about. That is a matter of great moment, which the Minister should take very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regardless of the directive's merits. I have given the Minister every credit for his view. Conservative Members accept that the Government intend such a directive to go through—their reasons may be best known to themselves, but they believe in them. However, the compliance cost and impact assessment documents suggest that the Minister's Department is incapable of producing a proper analysis of the effects of this measure that is sufficiently fine-grained and in tune with the Government's own view of the marginal utility of labour to be credible to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Maclean 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Penrith and The Border)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend accept that the problem is worse
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
than that? The Minister's own memorandum admits that the Government do not have a clue what the effect on small firms will be. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is however a lack of information on how small firms respond."</p></blockquote>
That refers to how they respond to giving employees time off work. The Minister is asking us to take a great leap in the dark and sign up to something in principle, although his Department has no idea what the effect on small firms will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree with my right hon. Friend. This brings me to my concluding point. I apologise for the length of my contribution, but I believe that it is the nub of the issue and I have on the wole tried to restrict my remakrs to brief utterances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be asserted with any degree of credibility that the failures of the compliance cost assessment and impact assessment document, and the other parts of the document to which my right hon. Friend refers, are due to any lack of intellect or information on the part of the Department of Trade and Industry. That is simply not plausible. It is a great Department of State, replete with economists of the highest standing, some of whom are well known to Conservative members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that they are better than the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In many ways—and my right hon. Friend seems to agree with me, given the remark he made from a sedentary position—they are more distinguished economists than those in Her Majesty's Treasury. Under those circumstances, there must be another explanation for why this is such a shoddy product. The only possible explanation is that is is a rushed product. It has been produced helter skelter, but why? This European directive has been launched in a rush at the Government's head, as is much European legislation. That was also the case with the previous regime, and is no fault of the Government's. But they should have taken the time to consider the directive seriously and give it the level of scrutiny that would be available ind omestic legislation. Instead, they said, "We wish to be good Europeans. We wish to pass the directive fast. We will therefore produce a product as fast as possible that looks as if it is a compliance cost assessment, an impact assessment, an explanatory memorandum, or whatever other bureaucratic apparatus is required by the Standing Orders. We will present this to the Committee and use our majority to ensure that is is accepted." For European legislation to proceed in that way does not seem to be in the interests of the Committee, the House or the country. These failures in the compliance cost assessment document teach us a more important lesson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may deal with the last point first, how the hon. Gentleman can suggest that the initiative has been launched at the Government, when the directive dates back to 22 September 1994, defies logic and belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome this debate, which highlights the fundamental and significant difference between Labour
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
and Conservative Members. Despite what the hon. Gentleman said in response to questions, it highlights how extreme the Conservative party has become on these issues. The tone of the comments—if not the substance—was that the social costs taken on by employers to comply with legislation are never justified. He suggested that no amount of legislation—however laudable—can ever be justified because of the costs incurred and that legislation should never be introduced to govern the way in which employers treat their employees. If we followed the logic of that, we could still be sending children up chimneys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to scrutinise the issues and examine them in detail. Before 1 May, I was a senior manager in the public sector for 10 years. Therefore, I understand the frustrations involved in getting employees to adapt, change and be flexible. An employer needs employees to work hard, to be flexible and to be adaptable. Crucially, however, employees must be enthusiastic and committed, and that requires the resolution of three basic issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, employees should be provided with a degree of security so that they are not constantly looking over their shoulders wondering whether they will be the next for the chop or for the disciplinary committee. Secondly, employers should set up adequate channels of communication so that people feel that they are informed, involved and valued. Thirdly, employees should have a sense of ownership and belonging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those three tenets of good employment practice are probably accepted by both sides of the Committee. Therefore, the key question is whether we need legislation to achieve them? Should we leave everything to the employer-employee relationship or should we introduce minimum standards through legislation? I think that there will be some agreement across the House of Commons that, in certain circumstances, legislation is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, even Conservative Members would accept the need for legislation on health and safety matters. Once the need for legislation is accepted, it is a matter of judgment to assess whether the proposals being made are justified. We should judge the directives on parental leave, works councils and part-time work in that light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the directive on part-time workers. It is undoubtedly true that the economy, industry and the employment position have changed and that we need employees to be more flexible. We need more part-time employees to adapt to the changing nature of work and the way that it is organised, particularly in the service sector. If employees are to be encouraged to undertake part-time work, they need something in return. They need a degree of security. Ensuring that they have the same rights as full-time employees is one way of achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive will have little impact on British law because the vast majority of differences between part-time and full-time employment are already outlawed. Different terms and conditions for different types of
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
employees could be construed as discrimination because the vast majority of part-time employees are women. Conservative Members have grossly overstated the directive's impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive on works councils is about communication sharing, involvement and consultation. There is no legal requirement anywhere in the proposals on an employer to accept what employees are putting forward. It is about consultation and communication. I say this with a degree of generosity, but one of the best things that the previous Government introduced was the "investors in people" programme, of which I have personal experience. One of the key tenets of the programme is that one has to communicate sufficiently with one's work force so that the lowest level of employee can understand the organisation's core philosophy, objectives and beliefs. That is worth while and it is something to which the previous Government gave money. If one believes that the programme was a success and that its aims were worth striving for, it should reinforce one's belief in the need to communicate with people to enable them to undertake their tasks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive on parental leave makes clear that it will be unpaid. There is no proposal for paid leave. On that basis, few will take it up, because most people are unable to forgo a quarter of a year's salary. Costs have been much debated—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is difficult to know whether people would take up parental leave? The Minister has not told us either the qualifying period or the age of the child. Without knowledge of the parameters, the hon. Gentleman's previous statement must be inaccurate. We have had no time to debate the question, which is why the proposal is fundamentally flawed. We have had insufficient time to scrutinise these important documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made the assertion based on simple common sense. In most circumstances, whatever the eligibility criteria, most people would not be prepared to forgo a quarter of a year's salary in order to take up the benefits of the provision. If the hon. Lady is suggesting anything otherwise, her view is not grounded on the reality of most people's lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then what is the point of making a provision that the hon. Gentleman believes nobody will take up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it is about encouraging the development of fair working practices and setting guidelines within which people can operate. That will be welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that parental leave is well established in Sweden? The previous survey of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showed that 0.2 per cent. of male and 0.6 per cent. of female employees took the option up—it was available if people needed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely true. Sweden has a history of governmental action based on the concept of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
partnership. Its record over the past 30 or 40 years—in terms of growth, prosperity, job creation and tax levels—bears up very well in comparison with other countries in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not view the proposals solely in terms of cost because there are unquantifiable costs in terms of the increased productivity of employees who will benefit from the directive. When employees' worth is recognised and they feel that they are being rewarded, they will work harder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished by the statement made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson). He wondered what the mother-in-law would say about father getting in the way. That may have been a lighthearted comment, but it reveals the gulf in understanding between the views of Conservative Members and the real world of work and the family today. Most people recognise that that world has changed and requires legislation—either from Europe or the UK—to address it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These issues have been debated ad nauseam within the House of Commons and during the election campaign. There was a clear divide between Labour, which intended to sign up to the social chapter, and the Conservative party, which opposed it for various reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that people vote for political parties for many reasons and that most people may accept some elements but not others of a party's programme. However, in my experience of seven years campaigning on the doorstep, I never encountered anyone who, though opposed to Europe on other issues, was opposed to Europe because of our commitment to sign up to the social chapter. It is all about minimum standards of fairness. Yes, we need flexibility, but there also has to be some give-and-take from employers. The Government, on the basis of these proposals on the social chapter, will achieve those objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.8 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad of one thing. By mentioning mothers-in-law, I at least drew the attention of Labour Members—and that is not always easy—to some of the preconceptions of our debate. Some people might have preconceptions about mothers-in-law; I certainly do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell) was interesting, as it gave a justification for the three draft directives: the Labour party's tremendous election victory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was previously argued by another Labour Member that all the issues relating to the social chapter had been debated during the general election and that the verdict of the people was clear. As many of us know well, however, there is all the difference between debate on the hustings—and there is not enough of that these days, it is mostly people sitting in front of television cameras—and the important process of enacting legislation that will be appropriate for the people of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members are sent to the House of Commons not to justify our activities here by what happened on the hustings, but to pass appropriate legislation that will
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
stand the test of time. That is why I was foolhardy enought to suggest that these three important social employment directives merited rather more than two and a half hours cursory—indeed, illusory—scrutiny in this European Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be argued that I am an old sentimentalist about parliamentary practices, but they have real merit. Perhaps my thought processes were affected by all the years during which we passed employment legislation. I remember the many hours, late into the night, that we trouped through the Division Lobbies on amendment after amendment, on such matters as pre-strike ballots, secondary picketing and the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot remember the legislation passed by the previous Labour Government, because, until now, I have not served in opposition, although I was in my party's research department and was not altogether removed from the parliamentary process. As I recall, the Labour party was always passionately committed to industrial, employment and social legislation. No amount of time was too long, and it was never too much trouble, to deal with the urgent imperatives of getting such matters right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue, therefore, that we do our voters a disservice, and our country a disservice in the future, by having recourse to the easy cop-out of adopting European directives hook, line and sinker, however worthy they might be in intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes the good point that the purpose of the Committee is to scrutinise legislation, and possibly to propose amendments to it. That point was also made by another Conservative Member. Will the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood explain why the Opposition have not tabled an amendment today? By not doing so, they are surely saying,
	<br><blockquote><p>"take it or leave it."</p></blockquote>
They are not offering scrutiny, nor amendments, nor anything constructive. They are simply saying that it is all in or all out. The Opposition are not allowing proposed legislation to be scrutinised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make two points about the hon. Gentleman's intervention. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) said, there are fundamental flaws in the proposed legislation. Secondly, even if the Opposition were to propose an amendment, what effect would it have? The chances of Her Majesty's Government implementing it at the Social Affairs Council would be relatively small, and they could be outvoted. To put forward amendments would be like whistling in the wind and I am not prepared to indulge myself with such illusions. We are dealing with hard realities—the measures that we are considering are draft directives, which will proceed. The Government have said that they want to accept them. Even if we were to reject them, the motion on the Order Paper for the House would be for acceptance. All that would be shown of our response would be that we had not taken note. The directives would still be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I argue that, instead of going for the LCED—the lowest common European denominator…
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
we should try not just to achieve the best harmonisation in the European Union, but to establish this country's economy as the best, with the best work processes and most appropriate social legislation, and to engage fully the skills, aptitudes and hearts and minds of our work forces. It is not right just to sign those responsibilities over to Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great joy of the democratic process is that it allows electorates to have second thoughts and to bring about change. If the directives become part of our law, how on earth will we change them? Shall we go back to the Council and say, "Sorry chaps, it doesn't work very well over here." It will no doubt say, "Well, perhaps it doesn't work well in Britain; you are a cantankerous, bolshie lot there, but it works well on the continent, so you must lump it and get on with it." There would be no way to change the provisions, except, of course, through a change to a Government who would decide to renegotiate our relationship with the European Union and the treaty basis on which the directives will be implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about the hearts and minds of employees. Can he give the Committee an insight into how one captures the hearts and minds of employees when the first thing that they know about the loss of their job is a notice on the factory gate, with no consultation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Gentleman's point. Such behaviour has done employees collectively the greatest damage, in the general opinion. That is why imaginative, forward-looking employers and politicial parties that want a balance between the rights of labour and capital have legislated—in this place—accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of the mechanism of the treaties to incorporate into British law the three very interesting and important social, economic and industrial measures that we are considering will mean that eventually our people will look to the European Court of Justice for their ultimate redress, rather than to our courts. They will say that if they do not obtain justice on taking an employer to court for alleged breach of his obligations, the matter could go to the European Court of Justice on appeal. That court has a built-in mechanism that favours the treaties. That is a diminution of the sovereignty of our people and institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We demean Parliament by engaging in the present charade of a process, and we also demean the exceedingly important subject matter of the three draft directives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other Labour Members, I shall be supporting the motion, with pleasure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implication of the remarks of the hon. Member for West Dorset was, I think, that very low employer costs and the freedom for employers to set wages in a rigorously free market are economically and, I suppose,
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
socially beneficial. The two sides of the Committee differ profoundly in their views on that. We take the view that protection for workers in various respects helps the economic process and promotes the social well-being and security of the employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If low wages and minimal workers' rights were conducive to a successful economy, our economic success over the past 18 years would have been much greater. The country that had the highest levels of wages, of worker protection and of employer and social costs also had the highest growth rate and living standards in western Europe. That country was West Germany. Recent events have changed the performance of Germany as a whole, but that has more to do with macro-economic policy than with what may be called supply-side factors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman recall that a few months ago—I think that it was when the Prime Minister addressed a conference in Germany—the head of the German employers federation, the equivalent of our Confederation of British Industry, made it clear that meeting the compliance costs imposed by the social chapter and other social provisions in Europe was a prime factor in the slump in the German economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to debate that matter with the right hon. Gentleman. I suggest that other, macroeconomic factors are at work, such as the value of the German currency and that country's attempt to cut public spending, and so on. Deflationary measures have had a major impact on Germany. As long as its currency was at relatively low value levels and investment levels were high, Germany was able to sustain a high growth rate and a successful economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that some mistakes are being made in economic policy in Europe. I hope that our European partners do not make the same errors as the previous British Government, but we are picking up the pieces and progress will soon be made. The Conservative party's former leader Baroness Thatcher said that there was no such thing as society and that all people were individuals. She believed that the best way forward was to fragment and atomise human beings. Such a formula makes people very miserable, but it also causes the economy to work less well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the hon. Gentleman's remarks with interest, and his contributions to the Committee over the past few months have been thoughtful. Does he agree that, regardless of the effect on economic growth, higher labour costs tend to push labour out and favour capital, with the result that employment levels are reduced in favour of capital investment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, does he accept that that is what appears to have happened in German? That country had high growth rates for some years, but they were based on increasing levels of unemployment and capital investment. Would the hon. Gentleman welcome that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right: if all other things remain equal, increasing the costs of labour makes a country less competitive. However, the matter
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
must be considered in the context of high investment levels, rapid growth and rapid change into more profitable forms of production. Interestingly, some of the most successful tiger economies deliberately decided to move from one form of production to another form that they considered more beneficial. That is a more sensible approach than that of an atomised work force and individual competition between workers in a system where employers have the maximum power to hire and fire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a dramatic change in attitudes in the trade union movement, which represents working people in Britain. In the 1970s, there was a great deal of suspicion of the approach exemplified by European works councils. I think that the German word was mitbestimmung, and it was suspected that that approach would undermine trade union strength and seduce workers into the pockets of management. People wanted to preserve at all costs their collective bargaining rights and strength, and they considered that that was the way forward. Twenty years on, with high unemployment and after a savage attack on trade union rights and immunities, trade unions have changed their views. They look more benignly on the works councils' approach, where there is discussion between managers and workers about changes in companies and ways of working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Change has been painful for many trade unionists. I am not necessarily saying that that has been the best way forward or that collective bargaining is wrong, but that those things have happened and trade unions have changed their position. They now strongly support the Government's view on the proposals; indeed, I have before me Unison's views, which are set out in a thoughtful and useful document that supports our position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some years ago I was involved in discussions with Commission officials. It became clear that there was a difference of philosophy between Britain and the continent of Europe, which is one reason Conservative Members of the European Parliament sit apart from the Christian Democrats, who are their natural allies. However, the Christian Democrats have a social or collectivist view of society which contrasts starkly with the individualistic view of the British Conservative party. Strangely, though the Christian Democrats are regarded as a conservative party, they perhaps have more in common with the modern Labour party, although there are big differences as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is pursuing an interesting argument. Under the previous Administration—the ancien regime which ended on 1 May—the Conservative party might have been regarded as Christian Democrat, but that was not a recipe for success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are so many elements of the debate that we could spend many hours on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two more points. First, Commission officials emphasised over many years in my discussions with them that such changes as they were proposing—the social chapter, for example—were about helping the European economy to work better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
If people feel more secure and happier about their place in society, they are much more likely to move from one job to another; giving people the choice of working part time or full time and not forcing them into a certain type of employment is beneficial to the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures are about making the economy work better. When employees are happy at work and have a sense of autonomy and power over their working lives—through law, trade unions or good relations with management—they work better, the economy works better and they are happier about taking on extra skills and changing jobs. One cannot argue with that contention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the problems of the European economy are more to do with macro-economic policy than with the issues that we are debating. The measures are supply side—attempts to make factors of production work better—and such factors are important to running an economy, but that must be set in the context of a strong macro-economic environment which involves exchange rates, interest rates and measures to ensure that investment takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would argue that those elements are essential to ensuring that our economy works well in the future, but they are not sufficient. We need the appropriate macroeconomic policies as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.28 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting but, sadly, somewhat truncated. The three directives undoubtedly deserve far lengthier and more detailed scrutiny than we have had the opportunity to give them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has come to the Committee in a ministerial capacity for the first time. As I am in a generous mood, I must congratulate him on that. Before I came to the Committee, however, I read some historical copies of 	<i>Hansard</i> reports of this Committee's proceedings. I found that the Minister had appeared in Committee on 6 March 1996, when he was in opposition. I read that particular transcript, which concerned worker information and consultation, and found that when I closed my eyes today, I could hear the very same words being spoken by him a year later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather sad that in the seven months that the hon. Gentleman has observed the country in the capacity of Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, he has not been able to make the jump from Opposition and to realise that he now has responsibility for this policy area and must answer the questions that are put to him by members of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition. He continues to act in a remarkable way. He has faced up to coming into government, but he has not brought with him the changed mind-set that he needs. He must appreciate that he is now answering questions, not merely rehashing attacks on the Conservative party. He has to satisfy the electorate that he has command of the detail of the subject on which he speaks. We have certainly not seen evidence of that today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To begin with, his Department did not inform members of the Committee or you, Mr. Cook, that the date for the Social Affairs Council meeting had changed. As I said in a point of order, that is not the first
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
time that the Department and the Minister's colleagues have brought imperfect papers to the Committee. That in itself is sloppy and poor practice, but what has really worried me is the Minister's inability to answer detailed points on costs—an inability which was revealed by the probing questions of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have also been tremendous contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) and from my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean). I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge drew attention to the fact that, once again, the Committee has been robbed of the presence of a Liberal Democrat Member and therefore we have been unable to hear that party's perspective on what both Labour and Conservative Members believe to be an extremely important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was clear from the Minister's answers that he has not yet been able to calculate the costs of the directives to the public purse—indeed, the documents that he placed before us said as much. Perhaps he could tell us in his wind-up speech when he will make that calculation and therefore when he will be able to tell the Committee and other hon. Members the exact costs that will fall on the British taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister could not tell us the costs to business of sick leave and extra training. Some of his answers left us with the impression that those costs were minuscule—indeed, that the costs of all three directives would be negligible. In the compliance cost assessment, about which the Minister is none too certain, the cost of paternity leave to business is estimated to be at least £65 million. If we look closer, we see that the cost of time off for pressing family reasons could amount to some £76 million. The Minister estimates that the annual cost of works councils could be as much as £18 million per annum and that there are non-recurrent establishment costs of £49 million. Already, the documents—imperfect though the Minister admits they may be—state that costs amounting to £208 million will be imposed on businesses and industry in this country alone. Does the Minister consider those to be minuscule? Does he consider them to be negligible? I think not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister admits that the measures on part-time work will disproportionately affect small businesses, but he presents no figures. Is he quite unmoved by the fact that our small and medium-sized enterprises could face costs that will make a great difference to their health? Does he agree that small and medium-sized enterprises are the life-blood of the economy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister expects us blithely to pass the documents as an act of faith. He says that they are okay and that they are what everyone wants, but they are not okay. In fact, the three directives before the Committee today represent a significant new burden on business—£208 million at a conservative estimate. The Minister is introducing a social tax on business. Sadly, the numbers on the Committee will not enable us to affect the passage of this legislation. There is nothing that
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
Conservative Members can do, so business will face a new social tax of at least £208 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scrutiny process in the Committee is fundamentally flawed. Many hon. Members on both sides of the House have agreed that there is not enough time and not enough opportunity to question Ministers in depth on many of the provisions that are rushed through these Committees. For example, we have not had the opportunity to probe the Minister about the difficulties of implementing the directive on part-time work. That issue was raised by the Select Committee on European Legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not had the opportunity to move on to issues such as the Government's concerns, which the Minister referred to in the explanatory memorandum only in general terms. We have not been able to probe the Government on the action that they will take if a qualified majority of the other member states agree to adopt the directive in terms that do not fully take account the United Kingdom's concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give the Minister enough time to respond, but I hope that he will read the transcript of the proceedings and do me the courtesy of replying to my questions in detail in writing. In my capacity as shadow spokesman I would appreciate that, and so would the permanent members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know what will happen regarding future measures. I raised with the Minister ITAC' s position on national works councils in Europe and he sought to make out that I was confused. I am not confused. ITAC has made a proposal and is pressing for national works councils to be extended to all British companies that have 50 or more employees. These are serious issues for British business and the Minister must answer my questions. In his winding-up speech, will he tell us whether he will say yes or no to the ITAC proposals? That question is being asked by British business and by Conservative Members, but the Minister chooses not to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, as this is the first time that I have sat on this Committee under your Chairmanship, Mr. Cook, I thank you for your guidance and the dignified way in which you have conducted the Committee's proceedings. I will now leave enough time for the Minister to reply in full to some of my questions. Perhaps he could now return to some of the answers that he gave in the question session which were less than perfect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for making such a kind introduction. She bent over backwards to be nice to me in an attempt to confuse me, but managed in the end to get back on line and made what almost amounted to a vicious attack on the Government's strategy on Europe. She is not quite up to that today because of the flu, and I realise that she is holding most of her fire for a future meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his kind remarks. For the record, we should note that he is also suffering from the flu.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not suggest that we go to the same quack to sort it out.

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
I want to answer some of the points that have been raised before making a general reply. If the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham wants detailed information, letters and specifics, I am more than happy to provide them. If she is unhappy with the arrangement for receiving material and wants a better one, I am happy to consider that. I want to ensure that my Department has a working relationship with the Opposition spokesperson as far as possible. When I was an Opposition spokesperson, I continually raised that issue with some of the hon. Lady's previous colleagues. Some were more helpful than others. I recognise her concerns and shall ensure that we provide the information that she seeks, if we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the allegation that we did not advise the Committee of the change in the date of the counsil's meeting, that is not the case. We notified hon. Members in writing on 27 November that the Luxembourg presidency would deal with the matters before us on 15 December. We issued an explanatory memorandum to that effect, which clearly set out the subject matter, compliance cost assessment and the timetable-15 December was the relevant date. I do not, therefore, accept the hon. Lady's criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady raised another issue about which I think she is confused. First, I thought that I had made it clear that there was no suggestion that the European works councils directive would be extended. Secondly, separate discussions are taking place at national level, about information and consultation and I clearly set out the Government's position on that. Thirdly, consultation is taking place on the extended sectors of the working time directive. Those are the three relevant areas. The hon. Lady has raised a red herring in regard to the Government's position. If she reads the record, she will find that it specifically shows that I made the Government's position on the issues that she raised absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sorry—the hon. Member for West Dorset. We are all trying to get used to constituencies and new Members, and some hon. Members are managing better than me. I apologise to the hon. Lady. At least we know the constituencies of hon. Members who did not go down at the election—some are still here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman must have been a spin doctor in a previous life. He has certainly tried to spin a yarn in relation to compliance cost assessment issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wish to set the record straight on one matter, which is not directly relevant. I have never in my life been a spin doctor and have nothing but contempt for spin doctors of any party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not according to my spin doctors—they tell me that the hon. Gentleman was definitely a spin doctor. There is nothing wrong with spin doctors, so the hon. Gentleman should not be so shy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government made it clear that the costs of the European works council are trivial, particularly when
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
one considers the benefits that it will bring in terms of improving relations and companies' competitiveness. The costs of the part-time workers' directive are insignificant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how often I shall have to deal with the parental leave directive. The hon. Gentleman alleged that the Government had failed to give the Committee proper information on the compliance cost assessment, but I reject that. It is cheap for a member of the party that formed the previous Government, which cost us £14 billion in compliance costs because of the poll tax, to stand up in Committee and complain that the Government are not appropriately considering compliance costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman went back in time, he would be able to listen to the hon. Lady reading directly and in great detail from information provided by the Government. They cannot have it both ways. Either we provided information that they disliked, or we did not. We have clearly provided the Committee with sufficient information on compliance costs. Secondly, we set those costs out in terms of the overall additional cost per employee and of administrative charges. We went further than I suspect that people expected us to go at this stage. We set out the information clearly and specifically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also gave a commitment at the outset that small and medium-sized businesses will be part of the consultation process on compliance costs. At the end of the consultation process, the Government will be in a position, with agreement, to bring forward proposals to introduce the directive. The Government have, rightly, bent over backwards to provide information on these matters to the Committee and the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether Labour Members would like to discuss with members of the Prime Minister's policy unit whether they regard themselves as spin doctors. I doubt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question to the Minister is simple. Does he accept that £1.70 is the marginal utility of labour in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is not about whether he presented figures. He did—I admitted it. The question is whether he accepts the figures in the document. Does he accept that £1.70 represents his view of the marginal utility of labour in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I will simply put on record the precise arrangements for the compliance costs, so the hon. Gentleman will not have to keep jumping up and down. The estimated annual cost to employers of compliance with this directive is between £55 million and £60 million. That represents an additional £5 to the annual cost of an employee. The estimates are towards the upper end of the range. It is difficult to estimate at this stage. We know that there will be flexibility and that it will affect the take-up of parental leave, based on 4.6 million employees with children under the age of eight. Does the hon. Gentleman want me to go on, or is that sufficient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I can read the document too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I was trying to make is that the hon. Gentleman cannot accept a common principle that the Government are providing information sufficient for the Committee to come to a decision. The hon. Gentleman has already admitted to my colleagues his total opposition to the proposal. He is not prepared to accept the simple premise that the overwhelming majority of industry in Britain already accepts it. This agreement between industry and employees is reasonable. It is reasonable that in case of emergency and illness the employee affected should have some time off in the form of unpaid leave. The simple premise is good practice and the hon. Gentleman is on record as opposing the concept in principle. Nothing that I can say will convince him otherwise. There seems no need to go any further on this—the hon. Gentleman has made his point and I have made mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow was a tour de force. He spoke of the strategy of employability, adaptability and the necessity for a flexible working environment to take into account the needs of a modern economy. He talked about partnership and the interests of developing an enterprise. That is critical. The three proposals are about companies fostering good relationships between employer and employee and coming to joint agreements on certain matters that take into account the needs of both the employee and the enterprise. There is also the question of a commitment by the employee and a responsibility to ensure that the enterprise succeeds. That is all that the proposals ask. My hon. Friend set out his points so well that I shall have to watch my back in future Front Bench reshuffles. I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood has been here for many years. I have listened to him on numerous occasions expressing his philosophical view—mostly without a note. I will not challenge his view. He is here on the same basis as me. He has been elected to the House of Commons, and he is here to promote his philosophical view of life. However, he did not mention whistling in the wind. Is that not precisely what his party, which was in government for 18 years, did regarding Europe, the economy and changes in the global marketplace? The Conservatives simply whistled as everything passed them by. But whistling in the wind became a political holocaust for the hon. Gentleman's party on 1 May. The British public had given up on the Conservatives. They did not want to be passed by anymore with regard to European issues of employability, of the marketplace or of research and development. The public want not a hands-off Government but one that engages, participates, and collaborates with colleagues in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The objective for both parties must surely be to make the British economy the paramount economy in Europe, rather than making Europe more harmonised, more standardised or more homogenised. The Opposition do not have that second objective to the same degree as the Government. The Government should adopt a national approach, and in Europe an approach that is based on community rather than union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those approaches are not incompatible. The Government are using both of them. A prime example is our action on social exclusion, unemployment and poverty. Within weeks of coming to power, we introduced a Budget that the hon. Gentleman and his party opposed, which was designed to invest in our indigenous young people and older, long-term unemployed workers. We did that, and we were prepared to do it. We also said to our European partners that proposals were needed to work together to deal with the 18 million unemployed people in Europe, to make the European economy more effective in the world economy, to make it more adaptable, and to make it more based on investment in the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approaches are not incompatible. We can use both, and we need to use both. That is why the hon. Gentleman stands on one leg when discussing European issues. In doing so, his party continually falls over and therefore does not represent Britain's best interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The works councils directive is a constructive measure to promote the policies that I have outlined. Informing and consulting workers is widely recognised as being good business practice. It means treating workers as people and not as machines. Workers who are informed and consulted are likely to be more committed to their company and to be more productive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European works councils directive puts in place sensible minimum requirements for informing and consulting employees at a European level. Many companies recognise the benefits of that. Some 60 of the UK-based multinationals already covered by the directive reached their own voluntary agreements on transnational information and consultation arrangements before the directive took effect. They included their employees despite the previous Government's so-called opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small firms are not affected by the directive. The small cost for large companies of setting up and operating arrangements should be put into perspective against the benefits that will accrue to employees and employers from better communication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other two directives under scrutiny are direct examples of partnership in action. The part-time work and parental leave directives are the outcome of a new approach to legislation in Europe, an approach from which we were excluded but in which we can now share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important parts of the directives are not the legislative technicalities agreed in the Council of Ministers. They are the practical agreements attached to the directives, which have been reached through partnership in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers and employees throughout Europe have contributed directly to the provisions and they are signed up to them. The agreements provide a minimum necessary framework to establish reasonable practice, while they leave maximum freedom for member states to sort out the details in ways that suit varying legislation and practices throughout the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That answers the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. In the context of the European directive and of the consultation process, the Government will reach agreements that best suit Britain's employers and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
employees. That means that employers throughout Europe have come to a common agreement with employees that such a basic minimum standard should exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three months is not long, and the leave will be unpaid. Many people may argue that the parental leave directive does not go far enough. The parties to the agreement—employers and employees' representatives—were anxious to reach a compromise to which everyone could agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive also gives individuals the right to take time off to deal with family emergency. The CBI said that the directive
	<br><blockquote><p>"provides no more than any good employer should provide in any event."</p></blockquote>
The second directive, on part-time work, is a stage further back along the track. The directive, if agreed, will bind the other 14 member states. We have undertaken to implement it here, and to negotiate a further mini-directive such as the parental leave directive, if there is a consensus that the provisions should be given legal force. There is no doubt that that consensus exists. Part-time work is a valuable element of a flexible and competitive labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to ensure that people have choice in the labour market. If they wish to work part time, they should be able to seek part-time work. In seeking part-time work, they should not be undermined because the work is part time. If we undermine people in the labour market, they will not accept flexibility. The directive is about freeing up the labour market. It will give people opportunities to enter the labour market in a way that meets their family requirements and those of business, which will be able to use part-time labour. Therefore, the directive is important to employers and employees. It will give both the maximum capacity to meet their needs. Meeting those needs will assist the development and improvement of the enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much room for manoeuvre in both directives. In implementing them, we have the opportunity to decide many details: up to what age of child should parental leave be taken; should conditions apply to taking urgent family leave; and how can a business find an equivalent full timer with whom to compare the part-time worker. We shall also consider a number of other issues. That is what the consultation process is all about, and it is one in which employers, in putting forward the proposal, already wish to engage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give the Committee the benefit of his view? On parental leave, where does he think the child's age limit should be drawn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our social partners have asked us, in the consultation process, to consider parental leave for children up to the age of eight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the Minister's view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter of my view. We are implementing proposals brought to us by employers and employees through the process of partnership. That is why the Government are going out to consult. They are the views not of the Government, but of social partners. We are committed to agreeing with the social
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
partners an arrangement to provide minimum standards. We shall do that after consultation. The proposals set out in the directive reflect the direct views of employer and employee organisations. The hon. Lady should accept that. If she is in favour of consultation and partnership, she should not criticise the Government and employers for wanting, in advance of consultation, to set out ideas for how that should take place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is so keen on consultation, will he tell the Committee how many companies and employees have written to the Department asking for the paternity leave directive to be implemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Off the top of my head, I cannot answer that question. However, I shall give the hon. Lady a considered answer in writing, and I shall send that to members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that—he must be feeling extremely generous today. Will he also tell me how many people have written to the Department to object to the paternity leave directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind trying to do the hon. Lady's job for her, but, every day, hon. Members are able to table parliamentary questions to seek information. The Government are very open in their relationships. If the hon. Lady wants information, we can and will provide it. However, she should not usurp the parliamentary processes. She should do her job as an Opposition spokesperson by tabling parliamentary questions. If the information she wants is available, I will provide it to her. May I continue, or has she any other questions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On flexibility in the labour market, the directives are important because the Government have set themselves specific minimum standards. The standards being introduced will assist in improving the ability of people to get round the labour market. They will assist in making the labour market more flexible, so that it meets the requirements of employers. The directives will achieve exactly that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One directive provides the capacity for employers and employees to come to decisions about future arrangements and working practices in an enterprise that take account of changes in the labour market. The parental leave directive will give the opportunity to employers and employees to take account of emergencies. In doing so, it will foster good relations between employers and employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have only a minute to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other directive will provide flexibility. Employers and employees can together draw up arrangements that satisfy the needs of the enterprise while, at the same time, providing minimum standards and demonstrating commitments to employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On both directives, the Government have put their case wisely and well. I ask the Committee to approve the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
