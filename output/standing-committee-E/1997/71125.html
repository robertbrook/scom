Biotechnological Inventions</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Science, Energy and Industry (Mr. John Battle)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In introducing this consideration of the proposals before us, I want to spell out that the document concerns the European Commission's proposal for establishing a clear framework for the legal protection of biotechnological inventions through the harmonisation of certain aspects of national patent law. The Commission's attempt in Europe to achieve that has a long history. As far back as 1995 the Commission published a White Paper on the completion of the internal market, which foresaw action on biotechnological patents. A first proposal emerged in 1988 and the Council of Ministers was able to adopt a common position on the directive back in 1994.<br><br>
On Second Reading, the European Parliament sought to introduce amendments which were found to be unacceptable to the Council. Although a joint text was agreed during the conciliation process, the European Parliament voted against that text and the proposal was not adopted.<br><br>
The Commission has now embarked on a fresh attempt to harmonise national patent laws to pull them together. A second proposal emerged at the beginning of 1996 and the European Parliament voted in July this year to introduce a further 70 amendments to the Commission's text. The document before us today is the Commission's revised proposal, which incorporates almost all the amendments that Parliament sought at the time. There is already substantial harmonisation between the national patent laws of member states of the European Union. All the members of the European patent organisation—[<i>Interruption</i>.]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Speaker has made it clear that no one should carry electronic toys during House of Commons proceedings and I fully support that view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I am not carrying any electronic toys, as far as I am aware. I apologise for the interruption.<br><br>
All members of the European Union are members of the European Patent Organisation and its central patent-granting authority, the European Patent Office, is based in Munich. By making a single application to the European Patent Office, applicants for patents may obtain rights in several or all member states. However, patents may be obtained without using the European route by making separate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
applications to the national authorities and, in any event, one granted, all rights are subject to national patent laws.<br><br>
To put the system into effect, national laws of member states were closely aligned with the European patent convention 1978. Although the text of member states' national laws is closely aligned, there are differences of interpretation between member states and between them and the European Patent Office. That confusion must be sorted out. The differences are causing uncertainties which may act as a deterrent not only to scientific research and development, but to industries using that scientific research and development. If they cannot patent properly, they do not know where they are and the confusion may block developments. That deterrent is unwelcome.<br><br>
I emphasise that biotechnology is a new science with huge potential. The treatment of asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hepatitis B and some forms of cancer is already being tackled through biotechnological solutions. Biotechnological changes to crops to enable them to withstand extremes of climate, while reducing reliance on pesticides and herbicides, are already highly significant developments. I am tempted to say that they may be the tip of the iceberg in the potential of technology to deliver change.<br><br>
To enable the biotechnology sector to deliver its potential benefits to enhance the quality of life on our planet, the legal framework within which decisions are made to invest in research and to bring new products to market must encourage innovation and the taking of commercial risk.<br><br>
The patent system is absolutely essential: it is an integral part of that framework. Although the examples that I have given and other potential developments must be beneficial, I am aware that there is a sense of awe around the technology—a sense of threat, and a worry about where it may lead. It is surrounded by social and ethical anxieties. We need a fuller understanding of the relationship between scientific research, ethics and law. Scientific developments must be life enhancing and not dehumanising.<br><br>
The European Parliament rejected the Commssion's first attempt to introduce this harmonising directive because it felt that the proposal did not deal properly with ethical issues. The document is intended to incorporate almost all the Parliament's views, and to get the balance right between patent law and ethical anxieties in so far as patent law can deal with such issues.<br><br>
All patent rights are without prejudice to other bodies of law: the patent law has to be perfected, but that does not diminish the need for other laws to act as a counter and as a check on inventions. Patents provide a negative right: a limited right to prevent others from using a protected invention. They do not give rights to use an invention or to market products or services that embody a protected invention. That use is determined by regulations that consider and safeguard human dignity, the environment and animal welfare. Those regulations must keep pace with technology.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0291">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
The proposal will have little effect on United Kingdom patent law—the Patents Act 1977. The proposal will not lead to anything becoming patentable that is not currently patentable under existing legislation. Changes will be required, however, to limit access to patent rights in some sensitive areas of technology. Patents will not be granted for genetically modified animals if such genetic modification causes suffering without substantial medical benefit; for reproductive cloning of human beings; for processes in which the germ line genetic identity of human beings is modified; or for some processes in which human embryos are used.<br><br>
The proposal is intended to clarify what is patentable. It confirms that discoveries may not necessarily be regarded as patentable inventions. It is designed to harmonise practice in Europe to create a single market in biotechnology, which is vital to enable those who research into the area to know where they stand within the European Union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We now have until 11.30 am to question the Minister. Provided that questions are brief and to the point, we shall succeed in fitting in many of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his opening statement. I appreciate the Clerk's efforts to remedy the late deposit of papers for our scrutiny.<br><br>
I raised that matter with the Minister at the Committee's previous sitting. Can he explain, therefore, why the specific request of the Select Committee on European Legislation that the Minister provide a report on the 17 October meeting of interested parties was not complied with until after 7 pm yesterday? Does the Minister appreciate that the Select Committee did not ask lightly for that report? Was not his Department in serious dereliction of its duty in producing the documents at 7.15 pm? Has he any explanation for that, apart from carelessness or lack of attention to detail? How does he expect the Chairman, members of the Committee or other hon. Members to absorb such a quantity of material in that time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise unreservedly to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and to the Committee. Documents ought to be available in proper time so that members of the Committee can read them and contribute to their scrutiny. These documents did arrive late, including my own copy. I can say only that the four documents that we will scrutinise today—the initial proposed directive, the Department's explanatory memorandum, the revised proposal and the supplementary memorandum—were sent out on 18 November by my Department's parliamentary branch to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and the Vote Office, and to all members of the Committee on 20 November.<br><br>
It was brought to my attention by officials yesterday evening that the Select Committee on European Legislation had asked for a report of the public consultation meeting held to discuss the proposed directive. The documents provided are transcripts of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
the 17 October meeting and a compilation of the written evidence submitted then. Committee documents should, of course, be available to us, but those that we are to scrutinise were available.<br><br>
The other material is supplementary, and I can hint that some of it was available as some of the written material was sent out to hon. Members. That is no excuse, as every member of the Committee should have received the documents.<br><br>
I can only apologise and emphasise that I do not believe that the late delivery will substantially change our consideration of the documents before us. Those documents are detailed and include a lot of background evidence, particularly the first of them. We are considering the second version of an original document and there has been some change. The consultation did not take place in a vacuum as there have been conversations on this matter across Europe since 1988. I hope that the fact that the documents were not available will not substantially alter our ability to scrutinise the relevant documents.<br><br>
I have asked my Permanent Secretary to find out why the documents were not available on time and an inquiry will take place. I apologise unreservedly to the hon. Lady, to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and to the rest of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that generous apology. However, papers considered vital by the European Select Committee were not available in time. I do not intend to go into the detail of the transcripts. As the Minister has rightly said, they are not a report of the meeting, but it is on the record that many of those who attended the public meeting were not satisfied with how it was conducted. The documents do not contain a list of those who attended, but are a verbatim transcript from tape and include blanks and asterisks where the tape missed things. I have read the transcript since I received it at half-past eight last night. I am not entirely convinced that the Minister has had the opportunity to scrutinise what was said at the public meeting and I hope that he will read the transcript because if I were him, I would be unhappy with some of its comments.<br><br>
First, it would seem that the Minister, through no fault of his own but perhaps the fault of his Department, has not provided papers for this morning's meeting on a timely basis.<br><br>
Secondly, why did the Minister ignore the Select Committee's request for the matter to be debated on the Floor of the House? When members of the Select Committee scrutinised the documentation, they considered the matter to be of such importance as to deserve a wider debate. That request has been totally ignored by the Minister, who instead prefers to conduct what he describes as a "low-key" approach to a matter that the Select Committee considered to be of
<br><blockquote><p>"considerable legal and political importance."</p></blockquote>
This is not a trivial subject but a matter of public interest, so I ask the Minister why it was decided that the debate should be held in Committee and not on the Floor of the House where a wider group of hon. Members could participate?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0292">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To begin with a general point, I do not believe that this will be the final debate on the matter. I accept that the process is not perfect, but the purpose of the public consultation on 17 October was to open up a public debate in Britain. The debate has already started in Europe and a wider area, and it will continue. In 1999, the World Trade Organisation will re-examine the whole issue of biotechnology patenting, on which there will be international debate.<br><br>
As to why this debate is being held in Committee, I am tempted to say that it is not in my hands to decide whether debates are held in Committee or on the Floor of the House. I am tempted to say, perhaps somewhat arrogantly, that I prefer to debate such matters on the Floor of the House occasionally because it provides an opportunity to spell things out. However we are under some time pressure because the matter must be debated in Europe on 27 November, and I understand that business managers could find no time for a debate on the Floor of the House before then. I accept that we need consultation—consultation and discussions will continue—but we also need decisions so that our representatives at the Council of Ministers can be clear about our position. I do not believe that we can find space in the timetable for the House thoroughly to debate this matter before 27 November and I hope that it can be given a proper airing in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Madam Chairman. Is it within your power to instruct the Committee to get down to debating the issues before us? Every one of the Committee's meetings is ruined by the Opposition taking the first half hour to talk about paperwork. Why cannot we get down to discussing these important issues?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the questions were not in order, they would not be called. As a general rule, it is important that members of the Committee are not only provided with the neceesary papers but that they receive them in sufficiently good time to be able to study them. That is a basic maxim on which the House of Commons has always operated. If members of the Opposition raise any questions that are out of order, the Chair will deal with it. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his help, but I can probably manage without it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has just said is complete nonsense. He began his reply by saying that this was not the final debate on the subject but then told us that the presidency aimed to reach a common position in the Council by 27 November. By his own admission, the Government have failed to find time to discuss the matter on the Floor of the House, even though the Minister thinks the subject is of significant importance and should be debated as widely as possible. Will the Minister consider asking the Leader of the House to hold a debate on the Floor of the House? It is obvious from the points of order that have been raised that some Labour Members are desperate to have a full discussion on this topic. The Minister should listen to his own party as well as the Opposition, and consider the subject to be on the back-burner until a full discussion in the House is possible.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
We should, perhaps, go to Europe to say that we cannot arrive at a common position as we have not been able to consider the matter at a national level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have debated the matter in the House. <i>Hansard</i> for 11 July 1997, shows that there was a debate at 2.10 pm on "The Future of Biotechnology". I am keen for wider debates on biotechnology in the future—today we are debating a rather limited provision to draw together and harmonise European law. We have been asked to arrive, after many years of discussion, at a common position at the European Council of Ministers this Thursday. That is the content and import of the documents that we are debating; it does not prevent further discussions in the House about the future of biotechnology. The only contribution from the Opposition to the previous debate was to leap up and attempt to introduce a debate on the tobacco industry.<br><br>
I do not know how seriously Opposition Members want to discuss the future of biotechnology—there was an opportunity on 11th July—but I hope that there will be further opportunities in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his opening statement, my hon. Friend the Minister referred to a sense of threat. I do not share that feeling, but many people do. Following a communication from my persistent and informed constituent, Mr. Bob Blagg of Bathgate, I gave a message to the Department that I would ask the Minister for his comments on what I regard as a rather alarmist article, which appeared in <i>The Guardian</i> on 8 November 1997 under the byline of Joanna Blythman. In particular, would the Minister give his opinion on the article's statement that
<br><blockquote><p>"The powerful biotechnology lobby that has forced gene foods on to the market for commercial gain has consistently represented potential risks from this new technology as insignificant in comparison to the much-vaunted gains."</p></blockquote>
Does the Department have any reflections on that point of view, which I do not share?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his patient work on these matters. He draws the attention of Parliament and Ministers to that area of scientific research, and scrutinisess it with a critical yet positive approach.<br><br>
I do not take the negative, almost millenarian, view of this area of technology. I believe that there are ambiguities—all areas of science can be humanising as well as de-humanising. We must work to the best of our abilities to ensure that scientific developments are humanising, and do not disrespect animal welfare, the environment or other concerns.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend that the article is alarmist. The directive that we are considering today differs from UK patent law by tightening the law, rather than having the opposite effect. In addition to the general exclusion from patentability or moral grounds, UK patent law would have to exclude four processes explicitly from patentability on the grounds that they are immoral. Those grounds would be: the cloning of human beings; genetically modifying human germ cells; methods in which human embryos are used; and processes for genetically modifying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0293">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
animals in which suffering is likely to be caused to the animals without substantial medical benefit to human or animals. The directive therefore tightens patent law in Britain, and takes into account the necessary ethical considerations.<br><br>
The pace of change in biotechnology is incredible, and we must do our best to ensure that these matters keep pace with technological developments. As that will be difficult to achieve, the conversation will, I believe, continue. It is important that presentations do not suggest that we undermine research in such matters nor that they actually stop it on the grounds that it cannot lead us towards good, because it can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is the question and answer part of our debate. The Minister will get the chance to make his speech later. If we have both brief questions and brief answers everyone will have a chance to be heard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clarify whether the burden of proof requirements in article 17 of the directive are in line with our existing patent law which puts the onus of proof on the defendant? As subparagraph 2 states that a defendant may protect his legitimate business secrets and processes in defending himself, does he not foresee problems in practice with the way in which the article will work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that question. The problem rests on whether something is an invention or a discovery. If human interference—human intelligence—is used, the classification shifts from natural discovery to invention. The detail of that will always be a matter for the courts. There will always be challenges. The purpose of patent law is to clarify that patentability applies to something which is artificial in the sense that it is a technical solution to a technical problem. In other words, something has to be invented by human beings and not simply discovered. It cannot be seen to be out there; some human intelligence must be added to it.<br><br>
The burden of proof as set out in article 17 is consistent with other laws such as the World Trade Organisation's intellectual property treaties. There is some convergence in international law on the burden of proof and on the differences between an invention and a discovery. It is important that we hold to that distinction so that companies can use and protect what they invent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's description of the proposal is that it is of a harmonising and technical nature, but one of the European Parliament's amendments will introduce an ethical dimension. I note from the documentation that the European Commission's group of advisers on the ethical implications of biotechnology will be required to assess all the ethical implications. What timetable will my hon. Friend suggest in negotiations for the undertaking of that extremely important work.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am assuming that the committee in Europe is already established. The suggestion by a Member of the European Parliament that there should be an ethical dimension to the issue was taken on board by the Commission which said that it would broaden the remit of the committee to which my hon. Friend referred. The committee will act and it will monitor the process. I emphasise that we ought not to say that we are in the hands of Europe because the checks in place in Britain ensure that ethical issues are raised. The human genetics advisory commission takes an overview of social, ethical and economic issues arising from advances in human genetics. It has a number of specialist committees—the advisory committee on genetic testing and the gene therapy advisory committee—which will advise on developments. We are talking about developments and they need to be carefully monitored at all times, both here in Britain and in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consider ensuring that the national bodies and, in so far as he has the power to do so, the European bodies which advise on matters of ethics, genetic manipulation and so on, are properly balanced? The Minister may know that any reasonable reading of the names of the people concerned in most of those bodies shows a disproportionate number with a predisposition to moving forward the barriers on genetic manipulation.<br><br>
We shall debate the Amsterdam treaty in full on Thursday. Does the Minister see any connection between the proposals before us under article 100a of the European patent convention, which is a single market provision, and the new human health arrangements proposed in the Amsterdam treaty? Will he enlighten us on whether those powers could be used in future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the first question on the composition of the committee, I have before me a list of the advisers on ethical indications of biotechnology and the terms of reference. The European Parliament and Council drew up the terms of reference in 1991 and I have a list of the members. I accept what the hon. Gentleman says that the committee should not consist only of biotechnological experts who are in favour of change. Glancing down the list, I see the name of Professor Dietmar Mieth who is not a biotechnician, but a Roman Catholic theologian and philosopher and director of the centre for ethics at the university of Tubingen. I hope that a range of voices is heard within Europe, not just those from within the industry, so that ethical dimensions are raised. I hope that that is also true of the Standing Advisory Committee on Industrial Property in Britain and the human genetics advisory committee.<br><br>
I know that the hon. member for Stone (Mr. Cash) is concerned about subsidiarity. The proposals will not undermine existing legislation in Britain preventing the use of patent inventions. He refered to health, and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 acts as another check.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Looking through the submissions and oral evidence at the public meeting at the Barbican hotel, it is clear that the majority of those who expressed concern had as their major concern animal welfare, which is perhaps a traditional concern in Britain. I not that the Commission recently proposed an amendment to 6.2(d), to which the Minister drew attention—that the patenting of animals for genetic purposes would not be permitted if it caused significant suffering unless it produced major medical benefits. As that is a recent addition, it seems likely that there will be pressure from the Council of Ministers to water it down. Will the Minister convey to our European partners that our concern is, if anything, in the opposite direction? I note that the Banner committee would have liked to impose a limit on suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I meant what I said. Brief questions should elicit a brief answer, which will enable every member of the Committee to get in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 25 of the original document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Whereas processes to modify genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering or physical handicap without substantial benefit to man or animal, and also animals resulting from such processes, must be excluded from patentability insofar as the suffering or physical handicaps inflicted on the animals concerned are out of proportion to"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the Minister will refrain from attempting to break the speed record and get into a pattern of speaking at normal speed without causing problems for the Official Report, we may progress a little better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. This is complex legislation and it is necessary to cross-reference the two documents. I wanted to quote that paragraph so that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) is clear that there has already been a change in the documentation. Under article 6(2), suffering to animals must be outweighed by the medical benefits. I know that my hon. Friend has a serious concern about in the matter and is interested in whether "suffering" includes physical handicap. I hope that it does and that that will satisfy my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following on from the point made by the hon. Member for Broxtowe, I am concerned about who will decide whether a patent application is likely to cause disproportionate suffering, as that seems to be a subjective decision. Does the Patent Office have the wherewithal or resources to make such an assessment? The hon. Gentleman is a scientist and I am not, but from what I know of biotechnology, it may be that an ability to feel suffering can be engineered out. We have all read of the chicken that is so grossly overweight that its legs are damaged; I imagine that it is possible, at least in theory, to develop a chicken that has no sensation in its legs. Would the Minister consider such a chicken to be suffering?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises the massive question of suffering, sentience and feeling in animals, which faces the whole of scientific experimentation and research. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe are right to raise that matter. As a nonscientist, it is difficult to see where the line should be drawn, but we cannot judge on sentience alone without considering medical benefits. That is why the phrase "outweighed by medical benefits" exists. Our purpose should not be to torture animals and increase their suffering, and I hope that scientists are responsible enough not to do so.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked who would decide. The patent examiner will take evidence. The ultimate arbiter will be the courts, as happens regularly within patent law when someone argues that someone else has not patented something that belongs to a third party, or where people believe that a patent has been given wrongly and would cause suffering to animals. Existing legislation does not rule out experiments absolutely. We are covered by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.<br><br>
We are getting the patent law right at a negative level—that is, why someone else cannot do something when I have patented it and released the idea into the public domain. What is done with that idea is then subject to a raft of laws relating to human rights, the environment and animals. Those laws remain in position as a check on this one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that patent law is a poor way of modifying research? If a piece of research is likely to have an unethical outcome, or be conducted by unethical means, it should not begin at all. What happens when a patent is applied for at the end of the process does not change that principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, my hon. Friend makes a good point which challenges scientists to be ethically responsible. That message should go loud and clear from Parliament to ensure a proper balance between scientific research and ethical consideration of how it impacts on human beings, the environment and animals. I cannot speak for all scientists, but I believe that they have ethical responsibilities as human beings and should be called to account. A patent brings the whole matter into the public domain by making sure that scientists cannot go on experimenting in secret and that we all know what they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify a point that I may not have understood properly. He touched on the difference between a discovery that may not be patentable and an invention that may be. The Minister will be aware of genetic sequencing work at the Wellcome Institute in my constituency. It involves discovery of one sixth of the human genome, but it is the product of a very technical process. What criterion will determine the distinction between a genetic sequence that is to be patentable and one that is not? What will be the role of commercial utility in that?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0295">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To be fair, the hon. Gentleman's question goes to the heart of the documents and the issue of biotechnology, and again we return to the problem of making a distinction. The purpose of patentability is to confirm that discoveries may not be regarded as patentable inventions. Patent inventions must incorporate industrially applicable elements obtained in a technical manner from the human body. Something is an invention because a person is skilled in the art of putting it together and reproducing it. An invention must be of a technical nature. Finding a new property of a non-material or an article is mere discovery—it is not patentable. An element of the human body that is not obtained with the aid of a technical process but is simply detached, removed or collected may not be regarded as a patentable invention.<br><br>
DNA, which is made up of some 3 billion basic pairs, is not patentable in its natural state in the human body. However, elements isolated by the human body by means of technical processes are artificial and therefore would qualify as inventions. That is the whole point of recombinatory biotechnology. People can isolate but only isolate—because they have the technical means to do so. Simply to discover a gene does not give the right to patent it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to tell us what plans, if any, the Commission has to inform the public about developments? There has been wide-ranging consultation and clearly some amendments have been made, but in view of the colossal implications behind much of what we are discussing this morning, what plans does the Commission have to ensure that the public are fully briefed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure of the Commission's plans but I shall ensure that that important consideration is raised at the Council of Ministers. My brief covers research and development and I am aware that the massive problem of getting the public to understand science is one for all of us, whether here or in Europe. Part of our science policy is to ensure that we work at programmes so that the public understand science, engineering and technology. Programmes and funding in this country cover biotechnology. In addition, the National Centre for Biotechnological Education is raising awareness throughout the school system of the potential of biotechnology. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has, I think, produced a booklet on the genetic modification of foods. It is available free of charge to increase public awareness.<br><br>
My hon.Friend is right to say that much work needs to be done to raise awareness. I believe that scientists have the responsibility not only to act ethically, but to communicate well what they are doing. It is not enough for them to make announcements that leave people floundering. They must explain why they are doing what they are doing in order to take people further into the debate. A European MORI poll showed, as other surveys have done, that people were anxious about what was happening in food technology, in animal technology and in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
biotechnology. They were most anxious about their lack of involvement in the debate and about the fact that there was no proper public consultation or understanding. We have all got work to do to improve that situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask what conversations the Minister has had to establish the position of the other countries that will be around the table later this month? Will he specifically address the point that he made in paragraph 29 of the explanatory memorandum which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"These provisions may"—</p></blockquote>
I emphasise may—
<br><blockquote><p>"impose specific ethical considerations into UK law extending beyond those currently taken into account"?</p></blockquote>
Can he assure us that UK industry will benefit from the directive? Can he also assure us that no further specific ethical considerations are going to be imposed on UK industry which will render it uncompetitive, especailly vis-a-vis its main competitors in Japan and the United States? We need to be sure, before the Minister goes into the negotiations, that no restrictions will be placed on UK industries which would allow the United States or Japan, in particular, to have a competitive advantage over a sector that is growing so rapidly and is to vital, not least to my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), who has many biotechnology industries in his constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has made some important points. I understand that the biotechnology industry is in favour of the directive because the harmonisation of patent law will help it to know where it stands in Europe. It is important that we have a share in patenting, not least because the UK already has a clear lead within the whole of Europe in industrial biotechnology. There are some 200 dedicated biotechnology companies. Including small and medium-sized enterprises, the sector employs 10,000 people in Britain alone, so it is a major industrial and commercial sector.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Lady that the industry is in favour of the directive, which will enhance the industry's competitiveness in Europe. The industry accepts the importance of ethical considerations. Directive 90/220 reviews the marketing of genetically modified organisms, and the Commission will publish a proposal on that at a later date. We cannot exclude further consideration of ethical matters but I am happy that the industry sees that as a benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the provision in the directive to assess the ethical dimension is extremely important? Although the harmonisation that may be contained in the proposals is in line with UK practice and may strengthen our position, does he agree that it is inevitable that the Commission will issue further harmonisation proposals, especially relating to ethics, in this important area?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0296">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that further proposals may relate to other sectors. I re-emphasise the point that I have been making that the directive deals with patent law and that, above it, there will be a series of other laws which will act as an ethical belt and braces. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 will tackle some of the health matters. The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) regulations 1995 and the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) regulations 1993 contain safeguards that prevent the unintentional release of products into the environment. So I suspect that some harmonisation of European law may take place with regard to the environment, animal welfare and health. However, patent law would not address that; it would draw on other areas of law to act as an ethical counterweight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In two days' time, the meeting with our European partners will take place. The motion before us says that it is,
<br><blockquote><p>"the Government's view that this Directive could harmonise and clarify national laws".</p></blockquote>
That suggests to me that there is an element of doubt in the Minister's mind. Surely he would not agree to a directive unless he was absolutely certain that it would achieve its objective. Will he say what changes he would like to make to the draft directive to enable him to use the word "would" instead of "could"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the word "could" is provisional but I do not think we need to make further changes. This has been a long and tortuous process in Europe, starting in 1988. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) asked me what other countries felt about this and we reserved our position until we could see the outcome of the Committee's deliberations today. We do not need to make changes. I suggest that the legislation does effect some change in British patent law now; there are four provisions that sharpen up our patent law. We are willing to accept them because we want the directive implemented; so far, it has proved impossible to make any progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, despite the rather cynical attitude often adopted towards the European Parliament, its refusal to accept the first draft has resulted in an improved directive that is now accepted as such by industry and many of industry's critics?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do. Four items change our position: the amendments to exclude germ line gene therapy to the extent that it is not already excluded; the amendments to exclude transgenic animals and processes producing them when suffering physical handicap; the amendments to determine the extent of any derogation from patent rights for a farmer to use protected livestock on his own farm for breeding purposes to replenish stock; and the provision in special circumstances of a system of compulsory cross-licencing when a patent holder cannot acquire or exploit a variety without infringing breeders' rights. One of the key themes was the notion that farmers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
could use their own materials—seed and animal. That is a significant change, and an improvement that British farmers will welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I bring the Minister back to my question? What may be satisfactory within Europe is all well and good, but we must examine the worldwide picture. It is there that competition originates and that growth potential exists. Will the Minister give an undertaking to British industry that nothing in the directive will disadvantage United Kingdom industry in the world market?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To the best of my understanding, nothing in the directive will disadvantage our industries; it will be beneficial for our industries to play such a role.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the existence of a firmer framework, including some ethical points that we have discussed and agreed, will stregthen the position of industry by making it less exposed to the risk of sudden political intervention disrupting its work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I would add that unless we achieve a common position in Europe, we are at a great disadvantage vis-a-vis the Americans, who have their own law and are blazing ahead in biotechnology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to his earlier answer, when he said that part of the purpose of extending patents was to get information into the public domain so that scientists cannot continue experimenting in secret? As a result of the nondisclosure rules in the patent application process, is it not true that the existence and availability of a patent requires scientists to carry out such activities in secret so as not to jeopardise the possibility of obtaining a patent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, once a scientist or an organisation applies for a patent, the research is published and in the public domain. We should encourage people to apply for patents because that enables us to see what research they are engaged in. That gives them the negative right to continue that research; it does not give them a licence to sell it, to market it or to print money. It also serves notice on the academic community—those who are adding to that technical expertise—that they have moved in on that particular area, and that others have the right to ask them for information or for permission to use and develop that research. Patent law therefore opens up rather than closes access to scientific research.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the Minister, but is it not the case that once research is under way, if the intention is to apply for a patent, those carrying out such research must keep it confidential? Information that might otherwise have been released through scientific journals and symposiums will therefore be kept secret until the date when the patent application is made. In the case of complex developments, that date could be some years later.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0297">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised the whole question of patent applications. It takes some time for scientists to have their work published in learned journals, and they sometimes put down early markers, in order to serve notice that they are working on a particular area of research. I see no difference between that and the registering of a thesis at a university.<br><br>
Without the protection of the patent, work can only be done in secrecy. I would be more worried if industry was conducting secret research about which we knew nothing. I would therefore encourage academics to consult the Patent Office if they believe they are on the verge of an invention rather than a discovery, which will allow them to register it in the public domain so that everyone knows what work is being undertaken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should declare, perhaps a little belatedly, that I am an adviser to a pharmaceutical company.<br><br>
Does the Minister agree that the net effect of the availability of patenting would almost certainly be more research and more open discussion. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) is correct to say that there would be certain constraints during the initial research, but the overall effect would be more research and more shared information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that, rather than inhibiting research, patenting will lead to more research. It is important, however, to clarify that patents do not themselves grant ownership. We are not debating ownership but a negative right. Third parties can only work with an invention with the patent holder's permission. At present, UK legislation—which will not be affected by the directive—provides for exemptions to patent rights for acts done for experimental purposes relating to the subject of a patented invention.<br><br>
The relationship between the researcher and the search for a patent will continue, and will open up research rather than close it down. In response to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge's important question, the idea is to have more openness rather than more secrecy, which is connected to the issue of public understanding as raised by one of my hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain what is meant by germ line therapy? It is not described in adequately simple terms for me to understand in any of these documents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that this might happen. Germ line therapy is therapy that could alter those reproductive cells that are capable of transmitting genetic material to our descendants. In other words, it is the alteration of human beings to enable them to pass on their genes in a certain sequence. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the language of scientists can be difficult. I initially felt more fear than awe about germ line therapy. However, it involves the transmission of genes, and perhaps the use of genetic engineering.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not this directive a fine example of this country co-operating with its European partners to bring about improvements? This particular directive introduces safeguards that can be welcomed generally, and should be viewed in a postive not a negative light.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for putting the directive in that context. I hope that it will add some depth and meaning to the word "harmonisation", which is the purpose of this legislation and the single market as a whole. The directive introduces a whole layer of safeguards relating to areas other than patent legislation—the environment, human beings, health and animal welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Department looking at the question of third-party rights in relation to patent law, which the Minister raised? It is a matter of Byzantine complexity. Any simplifying and clarifying of patent law in that field would be for the good, but does he know off the top of his head whether the Department is reflecting on the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Patent law is extremely complex and, I suspect, more contested in the courts than anything else, which means that a raft of practice and precedent has built up around it. The third-party question will run and run. It is a serious matter; the Department will treat it as so and reflect on it during its work on patents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have reached the end of questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. In light of the revelation by the hon. Member for Broxtowe that he is an adviser to a pharmaceutical company, can you give any advice to the Committee? I understood that a relevant interest had to be declared before an hon. Member spoke in the House or sat on a Committee that was dealing with a particular subject. I am rather alarmed that, although he was honest in his revelation, the hon. Gentleman made it during the closing minutes of questions. What action should be taken? Should the matter be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The responsibility of individual Members is to make known their particular involvement with a subject. They can do that by filling in the Register of Members' Interests. I am sure that everyone will ensure that interests are very clearly recorded before they take part in work of the House of Commons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Should we press for a change, whereby interests are registered before a debate so that all members of the Committee are aware of the paid interests of the Members taking part?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has been a Member of the House for some time. I suspect that she, in common with all sensible Members, will take a live

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
interest in not only the background and status but the interests of members of Committees. If she wants to pursue such matters elsewhere she may do so.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 10510/97, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions: and supports the Government's view that this Directive could harmonise and clarify national laws on the patenting of biotechnological inventions, so reducing the current uncertainty which exists in this area of law in Europe which has the potential to act as a deterrent in this industry.—[<i>Mr. Battle</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the Committee that I have selected the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan).</span></p>
<p>11.33 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the motion, in line 6, at the end add
<br><blockquote><p>';but in view of doubt about the possible effects of the draft Directive and lack of consultation on the version now under consideration believes that the Presidency should not seek to reach agreement on 27th November but instead allow adequate time for further clarification and negotiation.'.</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment and, in moving it, I want to make it clear that I support the way in which the Commission is proceeding, but while I do not want to be a dog in the manger or to damage our excellent biotechnology-based industries, the documents and the motion imply doubt over the effect of the directive.<br><br>
During questions, my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about the words "could harmonise" in the motion. The word "could" implies that the Minister is uncertain. In his answer, he gave the impression that the word "could" could be replaced, which leads me to conclude that the motion has not been prepared in the detailed and thorough fashion that I would expect from the Minister.<br><br>
It is vital that this sector of industry grows. We must ensure that there is no risk of damaging the United Kingdom industry, but the introduction of uncertainty through the word "could" means that the Minister is not sure on that matter. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can give me the assurance that I am seeking today. I believe that the new revised directive has not had the same opportunity for scrutiny as the former directive, which was scrutinised over a period of some eight years.<br><br>
I also hope that the Minister will agree that it is extremely important in the United Kingdom not to accept an obligation to legislate in so vital an area unless we are absolutely sure that more detailed consideration would not reveal damaging effects on the global position of our industry. If the Minister can assure us today that there will be no damaging effects on industry, I am sure that both industry and observers of the Committee's proceedings will rest a lot more easy in their beds. The uncertainty generated by the Minister in the wording of the motion and the hesitation shown regarding some of the areas in which he believes that there will be future effects on the industry, do not give me the confidence I need.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
I hope that the Minister will give a response that will satisfy not only Opposition Members but our industry and a wider audience.</span></p>
<p>11.36 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have any paid interests to declare. However, as a former employee of a pharmaceutical company and as a Member of Parliament representing a constituency whose major employer is a pharmaceutical company, I should declare that I am very interested in this subject. Indeed, we should all be interested, as it is vital to industry.<br><br>
I note the great efforts that were made by the Clerk and the Minister to prepare the papers for the Committee, and also to put right some of the criticisms of previous Committee sittings. The Opposition's complaints that this debate should have been held on the Floor of the House would have carried slightly more weight if the shadow Minister had been accompanied today by slightly more than two Opposition Members. I also note that this is the third sitting on the run not to have the presence of a Liberal Democrat Member. That is strange, for a party that claims to be so much in favour of Europe.<br><br>
My belief is that much of the objection to these directives and proposals is based on fear of progress. As a scientist, I do not share that fear. Perhaps it is because my background allows me to have more confidence in these matters. Perhaps my confidence is misplaced—who knows? But if the chap who invented the wheel—if it was a chap—knew that one day it would be put on a gun carriage, would he not have invented it? I doubt it. If we had realised that one day computers would be used to guide missiles, would we not have invented computers? I doubt it.<br><br>
It is sensible, when we embark on a journey in life or in science, to have some idea of where that journey is going, but sometimes we do not know exactly where we are going or what route we will take. Sometimes it is only when we get to the brow of a hill and look at the landscape in front of us that we can see the best route and where we want our journey to take us. I believe that that is the position when it comes to biotechnology and biotechnology research.<br><br>
We have an extremely strong pharmaceutical industry, but we should not kid ourselves that we have a strong biotechnology industry. We have some good players in that industry and some companies are moving into it. However, in comparison with the progress that has been made in the United States and in comparison with some of its industries, we have a weak biotechnology industry. There are two reasons for that. One, which I hope we shall return to debate at some future date, is the lamentable state of venture capital in this capital. The other is because we do not have the correct legislative framework within which industry can prosper. That is one of the problems that the directive is intended to put right. Whatever happens, it must be put alongside a framework that allows the ethics of research to be monitored.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0299">Image</span>

My earlier question made the point that if a piece of research is likely to have an outcome that we do not regard as ethical, we should not start it. We need to put in place measures that would prevent it being started. Similarly, if it is going to be conducted by non-ethical means, we need procedures to prevent it being carried out.<br><br>
Using patent law at the end of the process to try to modify the ethics of research is a weak tool. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made a good point when he talked about the problems that are associated with non-disclosure during the patent process. In many ways, that process discourages people from putting items in the public domain and is often the reason why unethical research can be carried out behind closed doors. Scientists are scared that when they get to the end of the line, they may not be able to obtain the patent they want.<br><br>
The framework provided for in the document deals with much of that problem. The people who initiated it did so because they are trying to put in place a legislative framework which will allow research to carry on, people to be open about what they are doing and structures to be created to modify and monitor the ethics of research but which will, at the end of the day, make it commercially viable to have conducted that research by allowing scientists to obtain the necessary patent to market their discovery.<br><br>
This is a good piece of legislation. The amendment would hamper British industry and prevent us from building a biotechnology industry that can compete with the United States.</span></p>
<p>11.41 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the objectives of the draft directive. It would secure a European-wide patent framework which would allow the biotechnology industry to flourish in Europe. I think that we would all share that aim.<br><br>
The matter at issue is the amount of scrutiny that the directive has received. Although it is narrowly focused on the patent issue, everyone will understand that, because of the huge ethical questions that are raised by any discussion of biotechnology and bioengineering, the public debate will go much wider than the mere subject of patents.<br><br>
It seems that the directive also raises the issue of—dreaded word—subsidiarity. I accept that patents should be dealt with at European level—a European-wide patent framework is already in place and it is entirely appropriate that we deal with the issue of biotechnological patents at the same level. The ethics aspect, however, must remain a matter for national competence. I shall return to that in a moment.<br><br>
I believe that the industry accepts that important ethical questions are raised by the debate on patenting biotechnology. It has taken considerable steps to reassure the public on that score. I am not opposed to the directive, but it is vital for the sake of the industry that is supposed to benefit from the measure that we carry public opinion with us. That means a meaningful
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
and open debate. The Government pride themselves on their openness and inclusiveness, but it appears that the measure is being railroaded through on a timetable that is being dictated to us by our partners in the European Union.<br><br>
Today, we are exercising the final parliamentary scrutiny that the directive will receive before 27 November, when it will probably be agreed to. The documents that the Select Committee said were necessary to inform the debate were, as we have already noted, delivered to us only last night. I am concerned that many of the people who gave their time and energy to participate in the consultation exercise will be extremely disappointed to discover that members of the Committee received the benefits of their deliberations only last night. When they read the transcript of the debate, they will find far fewer references to the documents than they might reasonably have expected. Will the Minister write to the people who participated in his consultation exercise and explain what happened? Will he make it clear that the lack of reference to their contributions is not a reflection of the Committee's appraisal of their quality, but simply of our inability to digest all that material in the time that was available? When the Government ask outside bodies to give their time and energy in a consultation process, it is important for us to show that we have taken due consideration and note of what has been said.<br><br>
Those concerns were expressed even at the meeting on 17 October. In the document that we received last night, Charles Secrett, the director of Friends of the Earth, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"What kind of discussion is it that the DTI are expecting when people had so little time to prepare, when there was no agenda for today circulated beforehand, when the list of people invited, has, up until today, been treated as confidential and when, in effect, there is so much public and commercial interest, people are necessarily being invited to give 'sound bites' on such complex issues—given the restrictions of today's proceedings."</p></blockquote>
He also said that he did not believe that the Government had provided the Patent Office with adequate resources for consultation. He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"We must question the government's intentions to fully consult over the draft directive."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister tell us whether he is truly satisfied with the way in which the consultation exercise has been conducted? Has sufficient time been given and been seen to be given to it? Has sufficient weight been given to the representations that were received on this important and wide-ranging issue? All sides agree that we must have an open and public debate if we are to carry public opinion with us.<br><br>
From my reading of the documentation, it seems that one of the big problems is that there are two separate strands to the issue. On one hand, there are advances to medical technology—the development of new medicines, therapies and methods of treatment, with which I imagine the public would broadly sympathise. Mixed in with that, however, is the agribusiness interest. Many of the ethical issues will receive a different public response depending on whether they are raised in the context of increasing food production and producing more efficient animals
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0300">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
simply to change the economics of farming or in the context of producing cures for diseases for which none currently exists. It is important that we see that divide—it may not be there in patent terms, but it is very clear in ethical terms.<br><br>
The Government may snub the Standing Committee and the Select Committee, which made it clear that this important issue should be debated on the Floor of the House; they may go to Brussels or wherever the meeting is to be held on 27th November, kowtow to the presidency's timetable and agree the measures without adequate public consultation. If they do, however, they will have to deal with the backlash from public opinion, if and when it comes.<br><br>
I want to use three examples to illustrate the areas in which more discussion and consideration of the issues is required before we go to Brussels to finalise our position. The matter of substantial medical benefit arose during questions to the Minister, who said that suffering by animals was to be considered acceptable only when substantial medical benefit could be derived. How is that substantial medical benefit to be assessed? Will the Patent Office be given the resources to make that assessment? Will provision be made for the recision of patents if it turns out that they have been granted in error, or will the process go through the courts?<br><br>
The Minister has said that, in line with existing patent law, there will always be the right of challenge in the courts. For example, an animal welfare group fearing that a patent has been wrongly granted and that animals are suffering as a result may go to court to seek to overturn the patent. But the process of complex litigation in the courts could take years. Will the Minister say whether a fast-track method to deal with such problems has been considered?<br><br>
I return to my central themes—public opinion and public confidence. I am keen to achieve a soundly based body of law to protect the industry. To work and to survive the test of time, that law must have the public's confidence. People in this country will not tolerate the grotesque spectacle of animal cloning in the pursuit of more efficient food production—greater yields of meat, milk, eggs and so on—if that surplus is later sold into intervention under the terms of the common agricultural policy. People would consider the encouragement of overproduction through genetic manipulation to be truly grotesque.<br><br>
The document refers to farmers' privilege—the rights that farmers will have to reproduce from their genetically engineering animals or plants. That matter is not defined sufficiently clearly in the draft directive.<br><br>
The analogy with the bootlegging of video tapes may not be good but it is the closest that I can make. Such bootlegging takes place on a grand scale. When genetically engineered and patented animals are out in the fields, to what extent will commercial agriculture be able to reproduce them? When does the legitimate activity of a commercial farmer become bootlegging? That is what it will be—the unauthorised reproduction of intellectual property. If it goes wrong, public confidence in the system will break down, so there is a need to get the matter right in the first instance.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
The document mentions exclusion from patentability on the grounds of public policy. However, would not that shatter the purpose of the document? If a European Union partner discovered a pressing matter of public policy—still the exclusive concern of national Governments—that required it not to allow the enforceability of patents across the swathe of biotechnology, would not that hypothetical country then become a bootlegger's paradise? That would be the equivalent of the way in which far eastern countries have become centres for the copying of all sorts of intellectual property within the existing law.<br><br>
I hope also that the Minister will clarify the question of national competence over ethical matters. Article 7 proposes that
<br><blockquote><p>"the Commission's Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnology shall assess all ethical aspects"</p></blockquote>
of the directive. That seems to cut across the principle of subsidiarity and national competence in ethical matters.<br><br>
I return to an answer that the Minister gave earlier about article 17 and the onus of proof in dealing with patent issues. He said that there are precedents, for example in the case of the World Trade Organisation, for the onus of proof being on the defendant. However, as I am sure he knows, in our commercial environment, the precedent is the other way round— the onus of proof is generally on the accuser, not the defendant. I am not an expert on patent law and I was hoping that in answer to the earlier question, the Minister would tell me whether the directive was a departure from the conventions of existing UK patent law. Perhaps he will do so in his summing up.<br><br>
Will the Minister consider the practical aspects? How will a small firm, accused of breaching a patent held by one of the industry giants, defend itself when the onus of proof is thrown on to it without, in the process, exposing the trade secrets that it has used to manufacture the product in question?<br><br>
I do not believe that those are insuperable problems, but having read the directive and asked myself those questions, I cannot find the answers. There are good reasons why those questions need to be dealt with before the final form of the directive is agreed with our partners in Brussels.<br><br>
In summary, it is important for a directive to clarify the issue of biotechnology patents across the European Union and to deal with interpretation on those matters. So far, we have taken nine years since the Commission's first draft proposals, so it seems a little absurd that in the consultation exercise on 16 October, the Minister said in his explanatory memorandum:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is thus only now that an indication of the range of views … can be given."</p></blockquote>
So it was only then that the Minister felt that we had a broad range of views to consider. It has already been pointed out that the Committee has not until now had the opportunity to consider most of those views. After brief and inadequate scrutiny in this Committee, in two days the measure will go to Brussels for possible agreement.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that during the long time it has taken to reach this point, the Americans, who did not take as long to put in place their framework, have enabled their biotechnology industry to take major steps that we will struggle to catch up with? That is why we need to make progress with the directive as quickly as possible. We cannot afford to have any more debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying and I certainly do not propose further long delay on the matter, but it is dangerous to say that we cannot afford any further debate. The Select Committee has said, and the representations that have been received show, that this issue is of great concern across the Community. The pharmaceutical companies, which stand to benefit from the directive and the resulting changes in legislation, recognise that there are huge ethical issues. If the directive is to be durable, we must get it right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is nine years a reasonable period during which to consult on a matter? Does the hon. Gentleman agree that as much as one consults on difficult issues, at some point a decision has to be made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat to the hon. Gentleman the Minister's words, which I quoted a few moments ago. We are not talking about nine years; the Minister said on 16 October:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is thus only now that an indication of the range of views … can be given."</p></blockquote>
This stage of the debate has got going only in the past month. I am not suggesting a delay of another year or two years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like me, my hon. Friend probably received at a very late hour last night the papers relating to the public meeting. I hope that he has had the opportunity to read them. Does he agree that the transcript of the meeting reveals that many people thought that the consultation process was trivial, that the organisation was poor, that there was no agenda presented at the meeting and that a list of participants was not available, and that several people were alarmed at the lack of consultation on the new directive? Indeed, there were even suggestions from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry that the chairman needed to reconsider the agenda because the meeting was so poorly conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Interventions, even from the Front Bench, should be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. The quotation from the director of Friends of the Earth showed precisely that some of the consultees thought that the consultation process was a sham. Everyone with an interest in making durable legislation which carries public opinion with it will acknowledge the need for proper and fair consultation to have been seen to have happened.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do the hon. Gentleman and his party accept that the proposals represent the European Union's second attempt to put together proposals on this subject? They are the result of previous proposals which were the subject of lengthy debate. The ethical issues were focused on. As a consequence of that debate, the previous proposals were thrown out and these proposals were drawn up to take account of the ethical concerns. The debate has been going on for a long time and these are not the original proposals, but the result of previous debates. Sooner or later, we must say that the time has come to make a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept that. I will not say that the old proposals have been thrown out as the hon. Gentleman suggested, but they have been amended and there is a consensus that they have been improved. However, that does not mean that they cannot be further improved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dr. Abby Munson, of the Genetics Forum, said that,
<br><blockquote><p>"having already met the Minister, and understanding his keenness to open up a public consultation … we were somewhat surprised to receive an invitation from the Patent Office which asked for written comments on the entire patent directive within a space of two weeks."</p></blockquote>
What is my hon. Friend's opinion of those comments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for reminding me of that quotation from the transcript. There are many suggestions in the transcript that some consultees are unhappy with the consultation process. I accept that we shall never completely satisfy everyone in this exercise and that some objectors to the proposals will not be satisfied whatever is done, short of the directive being wrecked. But the question is one of getting the balance right.<br><br>
I re-emphasise that my purpose is constructive. I want a directive that works for the biotechnology industry in Britain. I do not want there to be a backlash in one, two or three years when a nasty accident or incident finds its way into the tabloid press. I urge Labour Members not to be too worried about what is happening in the United States of America. We cannot afford more years of delay, but to ask us to deal with the matter today—to say that the matter cannot go to the Floor of the House because there is no time available before 27 November—is kowtowing to the presidency's timetable rather than doing things properly.<br><br>
There may be a backlash in the USA from public opinion because of the lack of proper debate. All I am suggesting to the Minister is that to make the measure soundly based, we need to carry public opinion with us and we need to be seen to have considered all the issues. I should be delighted if the Minister could answer my various questions about what I consider to be unfinished business within the directive. However, I believe more thought is required, and that is why I shall support the amendment.</span></p>

<p>12.5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) stressed the need not to damage British industry. We all agree, but her amendment would do just that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that the amendment was probing. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not infer anything from it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's opinion about the integrity of the amendment is a matter for her. She has described it as a probing amendment, but some of us have come to a different view after reading it. I am sure that you, Mrs. Dunwoody, will protect any hon. Member who takes a different view from that of any other. I do not share the hon. Lady's complacent view of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is getting a little personal in trying to read my mind and in accusing me of complacency. I wanted to debate this matter on the Floor of the House and to ensure that we dotted the i's and crossed the t's. It is pretty rum of the hon. Gentleman to accuse me of complacency. He could perhaps accuse the Liberal Democrats of being complacent; they are prominently absent from the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree.<br><br>
Returning to the point that I was seeking to make to the hon. Lady, hon. Members have been contacted by the industry. I have a not insignificant pile of letters from leading players including Glaxo Wellcome, Zeneca, bioindustry associations and others. Without exception, they say, "For goodness sake, get on with it". They say that there has been too much delay and that an important and growing part of British industry would be damaged by prevarication and delay. I do not want to make a personal attack on the hon. Lady—today is the first time in all my years in the House that I have been accused of making one, and I am quite shocked—but to put it on the record that her views about damage to British industry are not shared by the industry in question.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire referred to the Wellcome Institute in his constituency. Unless things change between now and when we vote on the matter, he and his hon. Friends will vote for an amendment that the industry does not want. However, the letter that I received from Wellcome states that implementation of the directive could also provide a considerable stimulus to UK industry and competitiveness. In the absence of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, I wonder how his intervention gels with what the company—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Could you advise me whether a permanent member of the Committee—the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson)—can criticise my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire in his absence when my hon. Friend, who is not a member of the Committee, has taken time out of what you,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
Mrs. Dunwoody, will know is a busy day to come here and listen to the debate in the interests of his constituents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Luckily for the Chair it is not a matter for me that individual Members of Parliament criticise one another. Indeed, I sometimes feel a little more talented criticism might do everyone a lot of good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the third intervention by the hon. Lady on my speech. I did not intend to criticise anyone. I was simply responding to an intervention made by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire. Whether he is a full member of the Committee or not is irrelevant. I was responding to what I recalled him saying, and I was trying to explain that that is not what the letter from the company said. In fact, it said the opposite.<br><br>
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham that the amendment is merely a probing amendment and that it poses no danger to this significant industry. That is not what the industry believes. I cannot identify a dissenting voice in the industry which wants to delay the directive.<br><br>
As for the ethical dimension, I agree to some extent with what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said about the public. There is a danger that the scientific avant garde will widen the gap between scientific progress and public opinion. The wider that gap becomes the more difficult it will be to make the progress that we all want to see. I understand the problem.<br><br>
The ethical dimension, which was introduced by the European Parliament, is important. The documentation, from what I could gather in the time available—my hon. Friend the Minister apologised for its late arrival—seems to deal mainly with the ethical dimension of the issue. Given that we now have an ethical dimension in the directive which will be subject to critical and detailed debate and scrutiny, it would be wrong for us to give any impression to the people involved in the public debate that we have taken no notice of what they have said. The ethical dimension exists. Most of what they discussed, as far as I could determine, concerned the ethical dimension. The critical debate about that must and will happen and what they say must and will be taken fully into account. I was pleased to hear my hon. Friend the Minister's assurances on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and I am glad that he believes that the debate will take place, but will he confirm that this will be the last opportunity for our Parliament to scrutinise and debate the issue if the directive is agreed to on 27 November, as looks likely? Whatever debates may take place in the country afterwards, this Parliament is elected to consider such matters on behalf of the people of Britain, and we shall have failed them if we have not adequately debated the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not what the Minister said in answer to the question, and I am prepared to rely on his assurances. The hon. Member for Runnymede and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0303">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
Weybridge quoted Charles Secrett from Friends of the Earth in the documents about which Opposition Members were so upset. The hon. Gentleman will know that Mr. Secrett made it clear in his contribution to the Meetings that he was speaking in a personal capacity. Although Charles Secrett's opinions are important, we must consider them in a personal capacity.<br><br>
I do not consider the amendment to be simply a probing amendment. If it is accepted, it will add to confusion and may damage an extremely important industry. It would not enhance the Government's position in terms of their positive contribution to an extremely important issue.</span></p>
<p>12.16 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and the Minister about ethics. We could continue to argue about ethics and it would be very difficult to come to any sort of consensus. The documentation on which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and I were working until late last night in the Library seems to express two polarised views. One group wants carte blanche to patent anything that they want, and on the other side, there is a group that argues that any legislation is wrong. The directive seeks to achieve a balance between those two conflicting demands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see from the Register of Members' Interests that the hon. Gentleman is a Member of Friends of the Earth. Charles Secrett, the director of Friends of the Earth, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"What kind of discussion is it that the DTI are expecting when people had so little time to prepare, when there was no agenda for today circulated beforehand, when the list of people invited, has, up until today, been treated as confidential and when, in effect, there is so much public and commercial interest, people are necessarily being invited to give 'soundbites' on such complex issues".</p></blockquote>
Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that representative of Friends of the Earth, an organisation of which he is a Member?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I notice that Charles Secrett said that he spoke in a personal capacity, so he was not necessarily representing Friends of the Earth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You do disagree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do disagree with him; I am not going to say that I agree with him when I do not. My point, however, is that there are two conflicting demands being made on this area of the law. It is a very difficult area; none of us can say that the decisions are easy. The directive seeks to balance the demands of science, the needs of industry and the views of those of us who are anxious about the ethical issues that arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has told us that Mr. Secrett says that he was appearing in his personal capacity. That is not what Mr. Secrett said. He said that he was representing, in his own individual
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
capacity, Friends of the Earth International, which is a network of 58 national Friends of the Earth organisations around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends how that statement is interpreted. The directive is attempting to strike a balance. I do not believe that the directive has been railroaded through—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recollect that the soundbite to which Mr. Secrett claims, according to the hon. Lady, he was restricted, extends to 10 pages of transcript?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution. I understand that he spoke for 32 minutes when he was asked to speak for five.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to know that you and he have something in common.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of railroading, the process has been going on for nine years. The problem is not that the directive is being railroaded through; it is that people are not getting the decision they want. As a result, they are asking for further consultation. The time for prevarication has come to an end and decisions need to be made.<br><br>
The crucial point about the directive and ethical considerations—the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge mentioned public disquiet—is how the ethical board that oversees patenting law does its job. If an ethical board is set up to judge what should be patented and which processes should be allowed, the workings of that ethical board will be crucial. We all know examples of supervisory boards that have responsibilities but do not do their jobs as effectively as possible. Whatever judgment is made and whatever directive is passed, there will be problems, unless the supervisory arrangements have the confidence of the public and the board is not seen as a body that will rubber stamp the interests of commercial organisations and industry. It will not matter what everyone else decides, or how much public debate there is, if the public do not have confidence in the supervisory regime within which patenting takes place and if we do not have an ethical board with teeth.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that we need wider public debate but it will be virtually impossible to get people at the two extremes to agree. We have to look for a sensible middle way forward, which meets conflicting demands. The directive issued a few years ago was significantly different from the one before the Committee, which is much improved as a result of consultation. Approving the directive will not be the end of the matter because people will have other ethical concerns, but it will enable us to move forward.</span></p>
<p>12.23 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before commenting on the subject, I want to clarify a point made earlier in response to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham. The agreement I made with Novartis
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0304">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
(UK) was recent and is therefore not in the Register of Members' Interests. I assume that it will appear in the first amendment.<br><br>
I want to summarise what I believe, after talking to constituents and interested groups, are people's main fears on this subject. Everyone who is remotely concerned with industry and science agrees that guidelines would be beneficial. There is a burden on people who are worried to say what their worries are so that we can see whether we have met their fears.<br><br>
One matter that is often mentioned—though it has not so far come up much today—is whether procedures for dealing with human genetic material can be patented almost against the will of the people involved. There have been discussions about patenting rare blood groups in South America and so on. It is important to make it clear that the granting of patents merely establishes legal protection for a procedure and has no effects on the rights of individuals to control their own genetic material. Whether any individual or group wishes to donate, sell or take any other action with genetic material that they possess remains entirely up to them. That is an important reassurance.<br><br>
We have discussed animal welfare, and I welcome the Minister's assurances on it. As he observed, additional national legislation will be appropriate on ethics and we would welcome the inclusion of recommendations from the Banner report of some years ago so that we can see whether Britain can go a little further than the general guidelines that have been mentioned.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge mentioned the danger that patenting would restrict the open flow of research. Recital 35 of the proposal takes accounting of that point. The Commission is instructed to investigate the extent to which research might be impeded by the patenting process. A comparison will be carried out with the laws of the United States and Japan and a report made to the European Parliament. Although there has been some concern about that point, I believe that the net effects will be positive for research.<br><br>
Food safety often arises in a general, rather unspecified way as people are vaguely worried that food may be "tampered with" and that they may not know what effect that might have. That area cannot be appropriately covered by patent law but the Minister may want to comment on the British Government's vigilance in protecting food safety as much in terms of genetic material as for any other reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a key way to ensure public confidence would be more transparent information about the origins of food and any genetic manipulation so that consumers could make informed choices?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Informed choice has an important role. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Informed choice requires extensive public information, or else we get the somewhat superficial information given in the labelling of additives. I often eat foods that have E917 or something in them, but that does not tell me much. To allay public unease, we need to go beyond
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
perfunctory labelling. On the whole, most people would accept that the Government are vigilant in this area and will wish to apply the same vigilance to genetically engineered products.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that gene manipulation has effectively taken place since life began? All the foods that we eat now are a result of the breeding of animals and plants for their particular qualities. We are now faced with a new technique that allows genetic manipulation to occur over a much shorter time scale. Many members of the public do not understand that, which makes providing information difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention on such an important point.<br><br>
The way forward is to make it clear to the public that genetic engineering is a modern development of an ancient process, as my hon. Friend pointed out. It is fair to say that genetic engineering can accomplish a more discrete leap from one form to another than has traditionally been possible with more traditional methods of, for instance, evolving new forms of plants. We should be vigilant, but we should also discourage the kind of hysteria that occasionally breaks out.<br><br>
Finally, several speakers commented during the innovation and small businesses debate recently that small businesses found it difficult to register patents in the appropriate way. They either registered early and waste their money because they are patenting the wrong thing, or they register late to find that somebody else has done it first. Alternatively, they might find that the costs of the patenting process are crippling. Given the importance of the biotechnology industry, will the Minister consider the possibility that the Department should offer some support for small firms seeking advice and help in the patenting process.</span></p>
<p>12.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the motion moved by my hon. Friend the Minister. At the same time, however, I have some reservations. Biotechnology is a very wide area, and a vast number of issues arise. That has been illustrated effectively this morning by the fact that there is even some difference between the opinions of Opposition Members. Their opinions are honestly held, and I do not disparage what they said. While the shadow spokesperson is more enthusiastic about the biotechnology industry, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is more cautious.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to set the record straight. I said at the beginning that I am keen to see a successful and properly structured directive in place, giving the UK biotechnology industry the protection that it needs to prosper. If that is to work in the long term, however, we must carry public opinion with us. That was my point throughout my contribution, which I now recognise to have been too lengthy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the intervention, as I have some sympathy for the hon. Gentleman's view.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0305">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I also set the record straight. I prefaced my remarks by saying that I sympathised with and supported the direction in which the directive was moving. The biotechnology industry in Britain must be protected within a global market. I am worried because the Minister is unsure of the effect of this directive, and is therefore unsure of whether its ultimate effect will be to damage the biotechnology industry in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The scientifically qualified among my hon. Friends gave me the impression that they strongly believed that the directive would help British industry in areas in which it has strengths. Those strengths should be given rein for the future.<br><br>
I want to express some caution about these matters because the public is understandably worried by the differences of view on this subject. We may not resolve those differences of view, but they should be recognised and discussed regularly. We have had nine or 10 years of such discussions, but still people are worried. They have seen great scientific and technological advances which initially seemed to be enormously beneficial, but which later revealed a down side—for example, industry and pollution, the internal combustion engine and carbon dioxide emissions, new medicines such as thalidomide, and the feeding of animals and BSE. All were welcomed enthusiastically as advances for human beings, but they later revealed a down side. The subject is vast and complicated, and full of so many possibilities that it is vital that the whole world, not just Britain or Europe, checks at every stage the potential effects of any invention or discovery.<br><br>
I have browsed through the reports of previous discussions—I have not read them all because they were received only yesterday, and I understand the reasons for that. It is important that such debate continues and is not left in the hands of Governments and industry. We must do as much as possible to explain the implications to a non-scientific public. I am not a scientist, but I have scientific background. I come from a scientific family and I have done some science, so I have an inkling of what goes on in complex biochemistry. Most people have no understanding of such matters and science can seem like mysticism, so we must explain ceaselessly to help people to understand and at least to grasp the issues. If we are not careful, science, industry and Government will race ahead of the population and we shall not take people with us but frighten them. It is important that we do not do that. Discussion, debate and explanation must continue daily for the foreseeable future. I make those points because I know that there is anxiety among the public—perhaps even among those in the Public Gallery— and I want them to realise that their anxiety is recognised by legislators.<br><br>
Finally, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to take specific note of the Compassion in World Fanning representations and the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe about article 6.2(d). This country is perhaps more concerned about animals than any other country in the world—with the possible exception of a minority who insist on hounding
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
animals to death on horseback, but more of that on Friday. The majority of people in Britain are very concerned about animals. We are taking a lead in general—Compassion in World Farming is doing so specifically—on animal rights and welfare issues. It is important that we use that moral high ground to ensure that colleagues throughout Europe and the rest of the world take note of the issues raised by Compassion in World Fanning and other animal welfare groups.</span></p>
<p>12.38 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee because I want to hear the Minister's response to the matters raised during our debate. It is obvious from the large number of contributions from Committee members and hon. Members who are not members of the Committee that there is very great interest in the subject. I hope that the Minister will note that by denying the opportunity to Members of Parliament to discuss the matter on the Floor of the House, as was recommended by the Select Committee on European Legislation, he has stifled debate on a subject that should be aired in a wider context.<br><br>
The Committee has been a trial of errors. The papers were delivered late, for which the Minister gave a fulsome apology, but this is the fourth European Standing Committee at which papers have not been in order and have not been delivered in time to enable Members of Parliament to scrutinise the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way because I shall be brief and I want the Minister to respond.<br><br>
I am worried that the Minister is taking us along a path where he accepts an obligation to legislate, as a result of a directive, without knowing for certain what ultimate effect that will have on the industry. I hope he will address that specifically in his final remarks.<br><br>
If that is the case, and the Minister cannot accept my amendment, perhaps he will table his own manuscript amendment to replace the word "could" with the word "will". He is hiding behind the word "could" because he is unsure of the outcome of the directive and of the effect that it will have on the industry. If he is absolutely certain that it will only benefit our industry, both in Europe and in the world, perhaps he will be so good as to table a manuscript amendment to his motion. Replacing the word "could" with the word "will" would bring great relief to those of us who do not believe that the Minister has fully examined the implications of the directive. I look forward to what he has to say before I decide what to do with the amendment.</span></p>
<p>12.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that Opposition Members sometimes do not realise that we are involved in a process—a process of consultation, which will continue, and a process of legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0306">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Lady when I have finished making my point, otherwise she will accuse me of stifling debate. If she lets me get beyond two sentences, I shall explain to her that Ministers are going to negotiate a position around the table at the Council of Ministers on Thursday. I am not prepared to change the wording now because they have to negotiate with our partners in Europe. We are not making the decision in this Parliament, but whatever is agreed will come to us for approval. At that time, with an affirmative resolution, we will be able to have a full debate. I do not understand the problem at this stage.<br><br>
I do not think that a further delay would benefit industry. I have been buried in letters from industry telling me that it needs the directive implemented immediately. In its submission, SmithKline Beecham said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Turning to UK competitiveness, failure to approve the Directive could have a very detrimental impact".</p></blockquote>
SmithKline Beecham wants the directive even though it knows that it is not perfect. SmithKline Beecham is aware that the industry is changing and that responses to it are changing. It realises that the directive will enable biotechnology in Britain to be more successful, to be internationally competitive and to have a proper harmonised position in Europe so that it can compete against America, as some of my hon. Friends mentioned, in a fair way.<br><br>
I cannot understand how the directive will be detrimental, as the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham alleges. Her amendment, however, if accepted, would be detrimental. We would not have a position on the issue and we would have to say to Europe, "We're holding on while we think about it for another eight years."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is so certain, why does he not table a manuscript amendment to change the word "could" to the word "will"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not need to because the motion gives our Minister a negotiating hand in Europe. We support what is in the documents. We do not need to have that casuistry.<br><br>
Opposition Members made a big deal about consultation. I did not notice them taking part in two debates on the Floor of the House last July. Let me spell this out: the Commission's revised proposal did not emerge until early September; I circulated it to all organisations involved and many wrote to me; I first met those organisations in July and invited them to take part in the consultation which we initiated; we publicised the proposals from Europe; we gave those organisations the short time of two weeks in which to submit comments because that was the timetable given to us by Brussels so that their comments could be heard there. I fail to understand what more could have been done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has may hon. Friend the Minister noted that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, who continues to demand a debate on the Floor of the House, now only has one colleague by her side?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. It should be put on the record that the Select Committee on European Legislation demanded that the debate be held on the Floor of the House and that the Minister ignored that request.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us be clear about what is happening. The Council of Ministers is seeking a common position. We hope that the European Parliament will support that. There will then be a second reading and the matter will return to us for another debate. We are in the process of consultation. I hope that today's deliberations will send a clear signal—as our resolution will do without the amendment holding it up—to our Minister at the Council, telling him to get on with it and come back with a clear proposal so that we can take a firm decision.<br><br>
I will write to everyone who has taken part in consultation and the hundreds of people who have written to me and to other hon. Members to thank them for their views, let them know where we get to at the next round in Brussels and invite them to continue the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clarify two points? First, he referred in the third person to "our Minister" in the discussions on 27 November. Is he going, and if not, who is? Secondly, he talked about a further debate. Can he assure us that there will be a debate on the Floor of the House when this matter comes back from Brussels?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If hon. Members had read the documents, and I now know that they have not—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would if you gave them to us in time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were given to you. </span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, the documents were given to hon. Members. Among those that were circulated in good time, hon. Members can find the information that this is a matter for the Council of Ministers on the internal market, not the Research and Development Council on which I serve, or the Energy Council. Lord Simon represents the Government on the internal market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. A very serious matter has been raised by the Minister. He has led the Committee this morning, but he will not lead the negotiations. Should not we adjourn and reconvene when the Minister who is responsible for negotiations can answer to us? The Committee exists so that Ministers who are carrying out negotiations can be scrutinised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister who has been referred to is in another place and would find it impossible to appear before this Committee. The choice of which Minister does an individual job is a matter for the Prime Minister.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0307">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It often happens that the matters that we have debated today fall within the responsibilities of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. I assume that we do not need a Minister from MAFF to be here so that every reference to every other Department can be covered. We are simply trying to bring before the Committee the DTI proposals that will go to the Council of Ministers with whoever represents us there.<br><br>
What a cheek Conservative Members have to suggest that we have tried to stifle debate. We introduced a debate in July on the Floor of the House, when my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) led the discussions. We have initiated meetings and I have placed articles in a newspaper, admittedly only <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i>, but at least the matter was debated there. Letters have gone to and fro, publicly and privately, and New Internationalist published a full edition on the matter. We have tried to debate the matter and we intend to carry on doing so because we believe that it is important that it is properly discussed.<br><br>
Yesterday, I announced that consultation will be taken further. In 1998, I hope to have consultation in a public forum, building towards a public conference on these matters. We are setting up other means of consultation so consultation is not limited simply to the Standing Advisory Committee for Industrial Property, which links with patent law and which was set up 20 years ago precisely to advise Ministers on aspects of industrial property. We want to broaden consultation and will continue to widen discussion.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to farmers' privilege. Provision is pragmatic, and it would not be helpful if patent holders tried to hunt down all infringers. That would be counterproductive and is not the purpose of the law. There has been consultation in order to reach this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was hoping that the Minister would take a breath at some point. I know he is pushed for time, but he must remember that an official record is being made of the proceedings. Quotations or responses given at enormous speed make it difficult to produce an accurate record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The farmers' privilege provision is pragmatic—it would not be helpful for patent holders to hunt down infringers. The directive operates in the same fashion as the Plant Varieties Bill, on which there has been a similar consultation and an agreement between plant breeders and farmers. Conversations have taken place behind the scenes to produce a workable arrangement. I hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will accept that.<br><br>
The World Trade Organisation's treaties cover the trade-related aspects of intellectual properties, the biotechnology provisions of which will be reviewed again in 1999. That will be another opportunity for a continuing process of international consultation. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that ethical matters concern only Britain.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
Ethical matters are international matters, which ràise questions for the northern and southern hemispheres. We must participate in such discussions.<br><br>
The issue of animal suffering was raised by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and has been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe on a number of occasions. Patents will not be available for the genetic modification of animals to produce more meat if that involves more suffering for the animals. I hope that that underlines the proportionality and balance here. Under the directives, applications can be refused by the Patent Office and rights can be revoked by the courts unless a medical benefit is built in. That medical balance is the whole point of changing from the first draft to the second draft.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about article 17 relating to the burden of proof, and I have been assured that that article is consistent with current UK law, which has been in place for 20 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer the specific question of whether a mechanism will exist for rescinding a patent if a subsequent development showed that it has been wrongly granted, other than through the lengthy court appeals procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the law, and the usual procedure would be through the courts. I take the hon. Gentleman's point, and we would want to ensure that court procedures do not waste large amounts of time. I will ask the Patent Office and patent lawyers to examine whether the process of rescinding patents can be speeded up.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham asked me for an assurance that the industry would not be threatened by any other ethical implications. This is not the only European Commission directive that is being considered at present. I previously referred to directive 90/220, which relates to the marketing of genetically modified organisms and which is up for revision. We are waiting for the Commission to publish its response to that, at which point ethical considerations could be introduced. A continuing coversation is taking place so I cannot give the hon. Lady the kind of guarantees that she wants.<br><br>
Patent law does not cover everything—laws on animal welfare, the environment and human beings are built into our law and international law to act as counterweights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that we could be subject to further unknown ethical considerations that will be brought in on the back of this directive? If so, we would be unable to stop them having an effect on UK industries because of qualified majority voting. Will the Minister clarify this point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will not be on the back of this directive. There are other directives on health, agriculture and genetically modified organisms in the agricultural sector, which could have an impact on the industry as a whole. It is more complex than patent law.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0308">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will there be an opportunity to block those directives, or will all the decisions be taken under qualified majority voting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say because I do not sit on the agriculture committee and cannot answer for all the directives that it is considering. They will, however, be treated in exactly the same way as other European Commission resolutions before the House. A Standing Committee may discuss the proposals of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which will obviously cross-reference with our debate, not least on the grounds of ethics.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe asked about vigilance and food safety. I must stress that openness is a central pillar in the establishment of the food standards agency. That should go some way to, positively and practically, dealing with the problem. The Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes considers all applications to market genetically modified foods and sets standards. In that area also there is a built-in structure for addressing those questions.<br><br>
On the question of the difficulties experienced by smaller organisations in obtaining patents, the Patent Office has a marketing unit which visits businesses and explains the patent system so that it can be used more cost effectively.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) spoke eloquently when he stressed that we need to achieve a balance between the need of the biotechnology industry for certainty when seeking patent rights and the social and ethical concerns raised by the technology. It is for regulation in other areas of law to prevent or control research and the uses to which the results of that research are put. It is clear that such regulations must keep up with the developments in technology. However, it seems that the European Commission, in drafting the present text for a patents directive and taking into account the views of the European Parliament, has sought to give us a strong steer on the need to balance advances in technology with the social and ethical issues raised. The directive's provisions, which deal with ethical issues, are radical and innovative, and go some way to ensuring that the social and ethical debate is ever present in our minds as legislators. However, we cannot sort out all the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
issues here because patent law is not a global law or a holdall for resolving all problems. We have to look to other areas of law for that.<br><br>
I conclude by quoting from a book entitled "Improving Nature?" on the science and ethics of genetic engineering, in which Reiss and Straughan warned:
<br><blockquote><p>"A cautious well-regulated step by step approach is the most responsible way forward. The socio-economic effects are even more difficult to predict and there is a clear ethical obligation on those countries and institutions which will profit from the new technology to minimise the losses of the most vulnerable economies and individuals."</p></blockquote>
That is the tone in which we have debated the directive this morning and that is the tone in which our Minister should put forward the documents in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady wish to press her amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
