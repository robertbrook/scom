	<p>[	<i>Relevant Documents: European Community Document No. 6123/98. European Community Document COM (98) 303 on a proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Regulation (EEC) No. 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy (the subject of the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 11th May 1998).]</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to see you in the Chair, Mrs. Roe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Commission's communication on fisheries monitoring under the common fisheries policy and the subsequent proposals amending Council regulation 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy. We wanted to progress the issue under the UK presidency and we are glad that the Commission has brought forward these proposals, which will be welcomed by all hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we came to office we made it clear that we were determined to put fisheries enforcement at the top of the political agenda. There is a growing realisation, domestically and across Europe, that effective enforcement is essential to the success of the common fisheries policy and the conservation of fish stocks and to ensuring the long-term viability of the fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the rules are to be respected by all fishermen, it is vital that they are applied consistently and with equal rigour throughout the Community. Failure to achieve that objective undermines the whole basis of our own enforcement efforts and those of other member states. We therefore welcome the action that is now being taken to address these important issues. It follows an undertaking secured by the Prime Minister at the Amsterdam summit from the President of the Commission that it would examine the need for improvements in Community enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee might find it helpful if I briefly give some background to the documents that we are discussing. The Commission communication was published on 19 February. It is a comprehensive and detailed document which reviews the operation of fisheries monitoring since the last assessment was made by the Commission in 1992, and it takes account of the progress that has been achieved since 1994 when Council regulation 2847/93 came into force. It analyses the major weaknesses that remain in control and monitoring activities and recommends a plan of action to improve enforcement over the next two to three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
The communication does not contain specific proposals but considers that amendments to the control regulation are needed to correct shortcomings that have become apparent in existing control arrangements. It highlights three main areas where priority action is needed. The objectives are: first, improving compliance with existing control measures; second, promoting greater transparency of the resources deployed and the enforcement activities carried out by member states; and third, encouraging greater co-operation between member states on enforcement activity. The Government strongly support those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the March Fisheries Council it was clear that there was widespread support for the Commission's communication. Member states agreed that effective monitoring and enforcement were essential to the successful operation of the common fisheries policy. They also welcomed the Commission's intention rapidly to produce a detailed action plan for improving the effectiveness of fisheries control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As part of that plan, the Commission has now presented proposals to amend the Communities' control regulation—Council regulation 2847/93. These proposals are set out in the document that has been tagged to the motion for debate. They entail more than 30 amendments to the existing control regulation. I will not use up the Committee's valuable time now to detail all the measures in the Commission's proposals, but the main elements fall into three categories: First, to improve transparency and co-operation among member states; secondly, to improve controls after the point of landing; and, thirdly, to provide for more effective monitoring of third-country vessels fishing in EU waters. In addition, some amendments that are aimed at strengthening controls take account of the experience gained and the deficiencies that have been identified since the control regulation came into force in 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that today we are unable to consider the Commission's 1996 annual report on monitoring under the common fisheries policy, which has not yet been published. That report, however, is unlikely to add substantially to the current debate on future enforcement arrangements in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that we might have the opportunity to consider today the Commission's detailed action plan for the next three years, but work on that is not yet complete. However, I understand that the plan will draw heavily on the material set out in the Commission's communication on fisheries monitoring and that it will provide a coherent strategy for improving control, involving closer co-operation and co-ordination between member states and the Commission. I will ensure that a copy of the action plan is made available to the Scrutiny Committee as soon as it is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission proposes that amendments to the control regulation will be in place by 1 January 1999. Although there is much work to be done, I am confident that that can be achieved. The Fisheries Council will have an initial debate on the proposals at its meeting on 8 June, with detailed consideration by experts to follow, paving the way for adoption later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that the Government will do their utmost during the remainder of our presidency to ensure that we make as much progress as possible so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
that the council can adopt measures that will lead to a fairer and more efficient enforcement regime as soon as practicable. I certainly hope that the Government will have the support of all parties on this matter. The fishing industry wants equality of enforcement across all EU member states, and we share that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 am for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all members of the Committee to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Page 2 of Commission document 6123/98 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"sizeable gains in terms of effectiveness".</p></blockquote>
How does that stack up against the statement in paragraph 3 on page 5, which deals with controls of landing and which states that there is no
	<br><blockquote><p>"commonly agreed definition of what is meant by a basic inspection"?</p></blockquote>
What is the Minister doing to rectify that fundamental failing of the Community's enforcement regime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take encouragement from the fact that the failing—there is no denying that it is a failing—has been recognised by the Commission and has been flagged up in the document. It makes it clear that there is no commonly agreed definition, and the Commission's amendments to the regulations want to create one. We strongly support that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a somewhat complacent answer. We heard all that when the original regulations were introduced. There has been a track record of failure to report on time and no action plan is before us, but the Minister takes comfort from that. What in the remaining month and a half will he practically do to get the Commission up to speed on this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I outlined in my opening statement what the Commission is doing and how it is bringing forward the proposals. The deadline is 1 January 1999. I repeat that the Commission recognises that the system has failings, but before one can bring about change, there must first be an acknowledgement of those failings. They have been acknowledged and we have been pressing the Commission to recognise them for many years. That has been done. Obviously work has to be done, but I am confident that we can resolve the issues before the 1999 deadline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister turn to paragraph 5 on page 9 of the document and tell me how everything will be achieved given what the first line of that paragraph states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a short answer to that question. However, the right hon. Gentleman will see recommendations in the document on the monitoring of fishing fleets, controls at sea, controls on landing, dealing with resource infringements and penalties, identifying six priority areas for action in 1998
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
including action forcefully under existing regulations, examination of how existing regulations can be combined to make controls more effective, pilot schemes for co-ordinating control operations and joint consideration of horizontal problems, amendments to the control regulation and its implementation and, if necessary, other regulations on fisheries monitoring. The document also recommends the first phase of satellite monitoring, the inclusion of the Mediterranean in the general rules, better information on resources in member states and the establishment of methods to ensure proper comparison and controls and the effectiveness of penalties applied. That is a decent action plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments on the document and the Commission's acceptance and acknowledgement of the problem show that the application of the monitoring regime in all member states is fundamental. That will strike a chord with the concerns of fisheries organisations throughout the United Kingdom and in other parts of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that recognition of the problem of monitoring was the first step in the process and that taking action to solve it was the next step. In which member states does he think that the greatest amount of work needs to be done to enforce a level playing field for all fisheries in Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In discussions in the Council of Ministers, all member states conceded that there were areas of fisheries enforcement that needed to be addressed, both in terms of national responsibilities and that includes the United Kingdom—and with a European dimension. All European states accept that there is room for improvement, and will argue for that improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On 10 February the Minister told me, in answer to a parliamentary question, that this and other important measures should not result in the discarding of more fish. Yet in answer to an earlier parliamentary question on 21 January, he stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"over quota fish must not be retained on board, transhipped or landed. Such fish should be returned to the sea."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 January 1998; Vol. 304, c. 574.]</p></blockquote>
Can he explain that blatant contradiction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no contradiction. That is the situation at present, and as it will be in the application of any enforcement rules. I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point about discards in relation to quota management. However, that is a separate issue, which should be addressed in terms of quota management. Enforcement is about quota control, which is not a perfect method. Discards occur and that is unfortunate. However, quota control is one way of providing an effective and simply administered method of fisheries enforcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome the Minister's emphasis on the need for equality of monitoring and enforcement across the EU. The document refers to exchanges of officials between national services, which showed a promising rise in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
some member states during 1997. Many hon. Members will see that as a welcome trend. There is also the possibility of increased resources for the EU inspectorate. Should we work towards a greater open-door policy between member states, to enable departments in individual states to spot check any other state at any time? Alternatively, should we put increased resources into the EU inspectorate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should do both. I welcome the proposals to strengthen the EU inspectorate. Its job is not to enforce the rules in individual member states, but to ensure that each member state is itself enforcing the rules. There has been a suggestion that national inspectors should accompany EU inspectors on their visits. That would have some benefits. I also welcome the proposals for greater co-operation between member states through the exchange of ideas and of inspectors. We have already begun to implement that. We had an exchange of Spanish inspectors who came to the UK to examine what we do in our fishing ports; and our inspectors went to Spanish fishing ports to examine the situation there. Most member states have vessels that need to land at various times in the ports of other member states, so it is essential to gather the necessary information and secure co-operation with other member states to ensure proper enforcement of all flagged vessels wherever they land. That is one of our priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Curry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Skipton and Ripon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The majority of effort is directed towards vessels over 10 m. How will we deal with the persistent under-declaration of engine capacity in that fleet? As enforcement becomes more vigorous, will there be a movement towards vessels under 10 m; and if so, what measures does the Minister envisage to ensure that the problem is not simply transposed to smaller vessels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has some experience of the fishing industry and he asks a pertinent question. I agree that under-declaration is a problem and I alluded to it when I spoke about our country having some important issues to tackle. Under-declaration of horse power is certainly one of them. The Government are not waiting or ducking our national responsibilities, but bringing in new measures on licence conditions that will deal with the horse power problem. We have been talking to the industry about the best mechanism to achieve that. We recognise it as a problem for this and other countries. There is some evidence of movement over the past few years out of the over-10 m fleet into the under-10 m fleet, which causes me some concern. By and large, the under-10 m fleet is a small scale, localised, sustainable fishery for which I have much sympathy and respect. However, if there is movement towards the under-10 m fleet and an increase in its efforts, it will have major implications for fish stocks and the sustainability of particular in-shore fleets. We must watch developments carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the purpose of designated ports is to end the practice of landing black fish, would the Minister be frank with the Committee and tell us what will happen to that black, or over-quota, fish if it cannot be landed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that black fish is, by definition, illegal. It is difficult to know the scale of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
landings and where exactly they are taking place. Those involved are unlikely to be forthcoming and tell us what is happening. We do know that it goes on, sometimes on a scale that can depress fish prices in fish markets, which does nobody in the industry any good. We also know that such fish can be of poor quality, which again pulls down the reputation of and undermines our fish markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman wants me to speculate, I could say that tackling the issue could mean more targeted landings in fish markets, which could increase prices. There is scope for concentrating more on quality. There are lessons to be learned and they have already been learnt by some parts of our fleet which are concentrating not on quantity—irrespective of whether there is a market for a particular kind of fish—but on top quality, premium products, identifying and aiming to satisfy those markets accordingly. That brings the greatest return to fishermen: those who have identified those markets and operated in that way have seen their prices rise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister further on the issue of pan-European inspection and enforcement. I appreciated his earlier answer, but I wanted more information about the notice given to ports where the inspection is due to take place. There seems to be much anecdotal evidence, which probably the Minister and certainly I have received, that when EU inspection vessels are due to visit a port, they see a sanitised view of what is really going on there. It is important for no notice to be given so that the EU inspectorate or other member states can call to inspect the monitoring arrangements of any other country. Does the Minister agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that if enforcement is to be effective—particularly for the EU inspectorate with the responsibility for ensuring that every member state is carrying out enforcement—it is essential for inspections to be unannounced. There must be spot checks. The power exists, and I want it to be exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Joan Humble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal for designated landing ports is a central plank in the Government's policy of controlling fish landings. However, there is concern in ports proposed for designation, such as Fleetwood, about landings elsewhere. Will the Minister provide reassurances about the control and monitoring of non-designated ports that he is considering, to ensure that fish will be landed as he has described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree that that needs to be dealt with. However, we are not the first country to introduce designated ports. Holland, for example, already operates a designated port system. Vessels there must land at specified ports. I suspect that that arrangement will be established across the European Union. The documents refer to the possibility of introducing designated ports, and there is great interest in our use of them to tackle problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach is not just about controlling the black fish problem, which the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) mentioned, although of course it entails
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
enforcement. It is also about developing fishing ports as centres of excellence in the fishing industry, with respect to their facilities and marketing. So social and economic benefits follow. Fleetwood has put much time and investment into developing its fisheries infrastructure. Fishing boats should make use of such a facility on that part of the coast.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister calculate the cost of fisheries enforcement and support in relation to the value of fish landed—perhaps adding a little for black fish—in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? How would he calculate value for money with respect to that expenditure? Is the ratio of cost to benefit so high in any other sector within his Department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The approximate cost of fisheries enforcement is £25 million. That is what the taxpayer pays across the board. I do not have the overall figures for landings, and of course it is difficult to calculate the value of black fish landings. Enforcement is necessary to a sustainable industry. We cannot escape our responsibilities as a Government and a member state. Debates have taken place about whether the industry should contribute to the relevant costs. There are all kinds of difficulties with that approach, as the right hon. Gentleman will know. However, a report has been produced by Portsmouth or Plymouth university. That will be made available to the industry, and a copy will be placed in the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dobbin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Heywood and Middleton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his opening statement the Minister mentioned his hopes for discussions and action during the United Kingdom presidency. Is he at liberty to tell us whether there has been any discussion or progress so far? This is obviously the time when we could make an impact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. There has been much talk—and the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) alluded to it—about the improvement of enforcement in the European Union. Yet nothing but talk has happened for a long time. For the first time, under the United Kingdom presidency, a document has been produced, a time scale has been set, and we are making real progress. Improvement is urgently needed and we are committed to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not satisfied that the Minister has given us the detail that we need about how matters will proceed. Page 9 of the Commission's report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present it is not possible for the Commission to carry out a quantitative and objective comparison of the means and methods of monitoring used by the various Member States."</p></blockquote>
It is a fundamental failing. Yet article 35 of the regulation which the Minister says will provide a solution states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the basis of the reports submitted by the Member States … the Commission shall draw up an assessment report every three years."</p></blockquote>
It has singularly failed to do that. I want the Minister to explain in detail what metamorphosis at the Commission will produce the results. Many additional regulations are being proposed, without any means of achieving anything. What will be done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those remarks hark back to the problems of the past. There is no doubt that there were failings. The documents are a blueprint for the future; they tackle the very points made by the right hon. Gentleman. Of course there are issues that need to be resolved, but the documents do not contain great detail because there is still a lot of work to be done in defining the areas that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I am sure that that will be done because it is part of the process and the process has started. That is the advantage of receiving the report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister share with the Committee the possible initiatives to provide that dialogue and listening approach at the quayside? In my constituency, the credibility of the common fisheries policy is an issue. How do we get the message across to people who work in the industry and convince them that we are taking urgent action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend represents the fishermen of Scarborough and he is correct in saying that there is a credibility problem with the common fisheries policy. No one pretends otherwise. The document is part of the attempt to address that credibility problem and to resolve some of the issues and problems faced by fishermen. A key concern is equality of enforcement, as I emphasised in my opening statement. I would go further and say that it is also necessary to involve fishermen and to listen to their views. The Government have set up regular, high-level meetings involving me, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, my right hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham), and all sectors of the industry. That has provided a useful opportunity for the industry to express its views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have also made it a key area of concern to progress the regionalisation of the common fisheries policy. Some regional committees have already been set up involving fishermen in those areas and they have been very successful. We want to extend and develop that so that fishermen can have an input. If enforcement is to work, fishermen must have an input and must see that it is applied fairly to themselves and other fishing nations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's reluctance to admit that if black fish are not landed, they must be dumped dead in the sea. He will recognise that it is outrageous how many dead fish are dumped in the sea. Does he also recognise that if the landing of black fish is ended—that is the purpose of many of the enforcement measures—the trawlers that might be returning to shore to land their catch will spend more time on the fishing grounds, and will catch their nets more often than they would otherwise do, until they have caught what they are permitted to land under their quotas? Is he content with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I readily admit that quotas are not a perfect system, but they are effective in managing fish stocks. We must have some management of fish stocks. We cannot have a free-for-all, or there would soon be no fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to disabuse the hon. Gentleman of his views on black fish. There is a world of difference between a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
small fisherman who has caught the odd box of over-quota fish accidentally in a mixed species fishery and those who deliberately target large quantities of over-quota fish. We must recognise that there is a serious problem, not only with the economic impact on the industry, but with the sustainability of the industry, which affects all fishermen. If we do not address the matter, fish stocks will continue to decline, which will hurt all fishermen economically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot ignore the issue of quota management and discards. A large proportion of discards are not marketable fish, but immature, under-sized fish of non-target species which are killed in the gear and thrown over the side. Those issues must be considered in terms of conservation—but that is a separate argument, and it differs from the application of proper and effective enforcement, although I am quite prepared to deal with both issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Humble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister mentioned catching undersized fish. I am sure that he is aware that in Holland earlier this week the market for plaice collapsed because there was an influx of ungutted, undersized fish. That matter is clearly relevant to the maintenance of sustainable fish stocks. Do the European Union's proposals aim to prevent the catching, discard and landing of undersized fish?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also mentioned Spain. What can we do about the fact that that country acknowledges that many undersized fish are landed there because it has a market for such fish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. There is a market for undersized fish in many countries. That practice is not sustainable, and it damages fish stocks, but it is encouraging that Governments do not try to make excuses for such practises. Such Governments have said, "Yes, we recognise that this is a real problem, and we must tackle it." The matter is dealt with in the documents and in the proposed amendments, especially in those relating to the traceability of undersized fish, and it will be discussed in a separate Commission document on marketing, which will be published soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission and member states believe that the problem of undersized fish could be dealt with at the market stage, where it may be easier to impose controls than at the fishing stage. The problem is recognised by the Commission, which is taking action to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that responsible fishermen across Europe welcome the introduction of satellite monitoring methods. It appears that very few United Kingdom vessels will be required to fit the satellite by the month after next, but almost all vessels that are over 24 m long will have to do so by 1 January 2000. There is every sign that other member states will give financial assistance to their fleets to install the new equipment. What assistance will our fleets receive for the installation of new satellite equipment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the requirement will initially affect only a very small number of vessels, which are, I might add, highly profitable. The provision of financial support for
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
satellite monitoring is dealt with in the comprehensive spending review, which is currently under way. We were elected on the understanding that we would work within existing budgets for two years, and there is no allocation in those budgets for the provision of such financial support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobbin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the most important issues in this context is the control mechanism, the effectiveness of which is affected by the number of training and inspection staff who will be available. Is the Community committed to ensuring that an adequate number of staff are available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The disparity between the number of professional fisheries inspectors in different countries, which is identified in the report, must be dealt with. There are signs that member states are increasing the number of inspectors to bring them into line with a European norm. The matter also involves training and the exchange of information, which we discussed earlier. All member states have introduced innovations and have good ideas, and we shall all benefit from an exchange of ideas. It is a very good idea to send inspectors to different member states through an exchange system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Remembering certain accurate conversations, will the Minister explain how the responsibilities for fisheries monitoring and surveillance will be allocated between the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the devolved Scottish Executive and its Welsh equivalent? Who will represent the United Kingdom in Brussels when such matters are discussed, and how will they do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a complex matter that goes beyond the scope of our discussion. Briefly, MAFF is currently responsible for fisheries detection in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, although responsibility is devolved to the Welsh Office and the Northern Ireland Office, which has one vessel for inspection. Fisheries inspection and enforcement is devolved to the Scottish Office, and the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency operates its own boats and planes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In its report, the Commission says that it is unable to guarantee the effectiveness of penalties and their even-handed application by member states. If there is not evenness and effectiveness, does the Minister have faith in article 35 of the revised regulation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. I take it that the right hon. Gentleman is arguing for a European court to take precedence over individual member states. Of course the Commission cannot guarantee effectiveness and an even-handed approach. Even we cannot guarantee that in our country, because courts in different parts of the country will apply the penalties, within the range set down, in different ways depending on individual circumstances. That is the Commission's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has concentrated on enforcement. An essential part of enforcement is penalties. Has progress been made on the definition of infringements across member states? That would give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
comfort to fishing organisations which want to ensure that the same penalties for the same infringements are enforced in all countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. That issue has been identified in the report. We have to agree that common standard, and work is taking place on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my questions about discards, the Minister will be aware that Norway has a different attitude to them. Why, with his concern for conservation, did the British Government apparently vote to reduce the minimum landing size of fish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not vote to reduce the minimum landing size of fish. Indeed, we argued against it because we believed that it sent the wrong signals to the industry. Nevertheless, there was a logic to the Commission's proposal. The minimum landing size of fish is related to mesh size. To reduce discards and to increase the minimum landing size requires an increase in mesh size. If that is not done, the number of discards is increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission proposed a reduction in the minimum landing size because it decreases the number of fish discarded. I would prefer to have higher minimum landing sizes of fish across a range of species, but to do that without dramatically increasing discards would mean an increase in mesh size. There is reluctance to do that, especially in mixed fisheries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the questions asked by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) on resources used to pursue the monitoring and enforcement role of MAFF, has the Minister reassessed his view on the Ministry's approach to those forms of fishing which are of no threat to stock? Has he reconsidered the appropriateness of expending large amounts of Government resources to monitor and enforce our acquiescence in the quota system? I am thinking in particular of mackerel handlines, the Fal oyster fishery and pilchard drift nets around our coast which are of no threat to stock. Removing them from the quota system could save the British Government and the EU a great deal in resources. It would also allow a number of fishermen to go into a form of fishing which is of no threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that I am sympathetic to the mackerel handlines and the shellfish sector. However, the problem is that there are signs of people moving into the under 10 m fleet. Effort in that sector appears to be increasing. The difficulty is that removing one sector—mackerel handlines, for example—from quota control would not create stability: other boats from all over the coast would target that fishery because of the lack of quota control, and soon there would be no fishery. It is therefore not feasible to abandon quota control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During my time as a Minister, it became entirely clear to me that Commission inspectors were not welcome in certain parts of northern Spain. What
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
actions has the Minister taken to address that problem, especially in the light of the modifications to article 29.3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of Commission inspectors experiencing any great difficulties. The level of inspection is certainly not adequate across all member states at present, and the proposals seek to address that. I do not doubt that inspectors encounter some occasional hostility, and I do not think that it is confined to northern Spain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Member states must recognise that there is a problem before the situation can be improved. Spain, and all other member states, has conceded that there is a problem, which is why I am confident that improvements will occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the square mesh panel dead?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Encouraging progress has been made and we have successfully persuaded the Commission to make square mesh panels compulsory across the EU fleet for the nephrops sector. We want the Commission to go further and make square mesh panels compulsory conservation gear across the EU demersal fleet. The fact that that has been accepted and applied in the nephrops sector is a welcome first step. Once fishermen from other member states recognise the effectiveness and advantages of square mesh panels, we will be able to argue for their compulsory use to be extended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of the Minister's determination to achieve a pan-European fisheries regime, does he see any advantage to regional coastal management discussions about shared interests in, for example, the North sea or around the English channel? Fishery organisations and national Governments of interested member states could discuss issues of enforcement in the context of the common fisheries policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see some advantages and some difficulties as well. I welcome the joint paper recently produced by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which made a number of constructive suggestions about reforming the common fisheries policy and taking into account regional and coastal state management. Some of those objectives will be easier to achieve and implement than others, but it is a constructive blueprint for the way forward, which we are discussing with fishermen's associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister now accepts that the ending of the landing of black fish will inevitably lead to an increase in the dumping of dead fish at sea. In answer to my last question, he said that minimum landing sizes had been decreased to reduce the number of discards. Is it not hugely illogical to increase the number of discards of perfectly saleable adult fish, while at the same time reducing the amount of discards of juvenile fish, which will now be caught and landed before they are old enough and big enough to breathe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The minimum landing sizes set by the Commission are not for juvenile fish but for marketable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
fish, within the parameters established by independent scientific advice. I would prefer the minimum landing size to be larger, which would be better for the market. We will continue to debate that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman assumes that extra fish will be discarded, but evidence shows that, on occasions, some fishermen have deliberately targeted over-quota fish—which is illegal fishing—on a large scale. We cannot condone that. Despite the consequences, the hon. Gentleman is more interested in protecting illegal fishing than in supporting measures to stamp it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the question that the hon. Member for Ludlow asked about discards, does the Minister still believe that the closure of cod fishing in under-10 metre boats is appropriate? It will largely affect a mixed fishery, and will inevitably result in dead fish being dumped at sea, as currently happens in the south-west.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given considerable thought to the closure of the channel cod fishery. It was a difficult decision because, as the hon. Gentleman rightly notes, cod levels in the English channel are currently high. The non-sector is currently taking 80 per cent. of the cod quota. Cod fishery is a very important fishery for the south coast in the winter and autumn. We are therefore anxious to ensure that cod stocks are available for that fishery. Given the present good stock of cod in the channel, we are making representations to the Commission about changes in cod stocks. Cod stocks may be increasing, but it is more likely that they are moving south from the North sea to the channel. On that basis we are seeking adjustments to the quota.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fishing industry has expressed a worry about modifications to article 6.2 of the proposed regulation. What is the Minister's view of the recording in log books of species catch quantities of above 50 kg?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is an improvement. Original proposals required the recording of even very small quantities of a range of species caught. In setting a limit of 50 kg, an attempt has been made to reduce the amount of bureaucracy in the fishing industry. I am all for doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from wishing to protect the activities of illegal fishermen, my worry is about conservation. Consider the following example. Two vessels—one French, the other British—are trawling alongside each other in the English channel, and make similar catches of cod. The French vessel will be allowed to land its catch but the British vessel will have to return its catch dead to the sea because the French have a quota of 76 per cent., where the British have a quota of only 8 per cent. In view of that, and of the question asked by the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George), is the Minister content with going down a road that will have such a disastrous effect on fish stocks? Without fish stocks there will he no fishing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong about the effect on fish stocks. His example is of one country with an unused quota and another with a quota that has been exhausted or which is being managed. In some
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
instances other countries are not allowed to land fish but Britain is. For example, we have 80 per cent. of the haddock stock, and 70 per cent. of North sea monkfish. The issue is not one of conservation, provided that member states keep to their quota allocations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quotas are not a perfect system. I would be willing to consider a system that enabled a sustainable proportion of the by-catch of marketable fish, provided that it could not be used as a loophole for illegal landings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister willing to make representations to the Commission to require Norwegian fishermen to report direct to member states, rather than to Brussels, under the proposed arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to third-country vessels such as those of Norway reporting to the coastal state rather than to Brussels. There is an issue of management and efficiency, although the Commission's view is that member states should generally be responsible for the fishery management of all vessels within their coastal waters. I believe that that is the right approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A report that was considered by the European Parliament's Fisheries Committee states that 20 to 40 per cent. of fish caught reaches the consumer. That creates enormous anxiety about conservation. Has the European Union examined the Norwegian model? Has it rejected that model? If so, why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Norwegians insist that all fish are landed and not discarded at sea. There are arguments for and against that approach. Enforcement is difficult—the Norwegians themselves find that it is a problem. How can one insist that all fish are landed when one cannot watch all fishing boats all the time? There is nothing to stop fishermen throwing unmarketable fish over the side of the boat and replacing them with marketable fish. We have rules and regulations to stop that practice, for the reasons outlined by the hon. Gentleman. Enforcement, however, remains problematic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What initiatives do the Government plan to take on revising fish marketing channels following the initiatives on designated ports and greater enforcement? Do the proposals under consideration mean that changes are required?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Union is introducing a draft directive on improving marketing that concentrates on quality. It argues for a greater role for fishermen, especially through producer organisations, in managing markets and in meeting requirements and standards. That will ensure a sustainable landing of fish and will help to prevent gluts and shortages. Producer organisations will play an important role in achieving those goals. Developments in food retailing that place greater emphasis on quality assurance schemes and traceability will have an impact on fish markets, creating changes in marketing that, I believe, will benefit the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's strong commitment to enforcement, will he undertake to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
produce a detailed statement of the points that he will raise before the end of Britain's presidency? Will he provide the Committee with the timetable that he expects the Commission and member states to follow? How will he judge whether the objectives of the new regulation and the report will have been achieved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the responsibility of the Commission. Britain's presidency lasts until June, and discussions will go on for a bit longer than that. We want to ensure that we put the programme on the right lines, similar to those that were mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman. We intend to give a report at the end of our presidency detailing what we have achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is aware of the number of fishermen who say—quite blatantly—that they have to cheat the system to survive. They cannot pay their mortgages and maintain their boats unless they cheat. Is not that an appalling admission that the whole regime is wrong? Does the Minister accept that the only practical and sensible way forward is for every nation to take control of its own exclusive fishing zones?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The decision on that matter was taken long ago. It was not made by the present Government, as the hon. Gentleman well knows. We cannot hark back to the past; we must deal with present realities and plan for the future. We will have a pan-European fishing policy, no matter what. Our top priority is to ensure that that policy is workable and that it sustains and conserves fish stocks for the benefit of the fishing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In past years the United Kingdom was denied help in modernising its fishing fleet. That was because of our inability to meet our multi-annual guidance programme targets. Is the Minister prepared to pursue the argument that other member states will be denied access to modernisation funds if they fail to achieve the high standards of enforcement that he supports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has a bit of a cheek to criticise the problem of constructive grants though lack of progress on MAGP and MGP IV. The Conservative party may have had some responsibility for that. This Government have dealt with that problem more successfully in one year than the right hon. Gentleman did in a decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that countries that do not accept their targets can be penalised. For example, they can be denied grants for modernisation. One could argue that sanctions should be available against those member states that do not meet the standards that will be laid down when these measures are adopted. That is a matter for the Commission and the Council of Ministers, but it is worth exploring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the end result of increasing the enforcement measures will be to reduce drastically the British fishing fleet? Does he not recognise the suspicion that the reduction of the British
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
fleet will be disproportionate when compared with the reduction of, say, the Spanish fishing fleet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not accept that. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman looks at the decline in the Spanish fishing fleet. It has been dramatic. Admittedly, much of that decline has been in its distant-water fleet, but that has had a huge economic impact on Spanish fishing ports. Let us not imagine that the restructuring of fishing fleets is a one-way process; it is not. Certain parts of our fishing fleet still have a problem of over-capacity given the fish stock available. We must tackle that problem, and we will have to take difficult decisions. They will involve a reduction in the UK fleet, but that reduction will be designed to make those remaining in the industry viable and prosperous. That is our target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why has Whitehaven, which has had £2 million spent on upgrading its landing facilities, not become a designated port?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman knows, we have been out to consultation on designated ports and that has just ended. I am sure that ports such as Whitehaven, which has received investment, will make representations. We will consider them. I emphasise, however, that the list of designated ports is designed to include those where over-22 m boats generally land. The ports on the list account for 90 per cent. of that category. If other ports feel that they will suffer as a result of vessels of that size landing in designated ports, they will have made their case in the consultation process and we will consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister seriously saying that there is over-capacity in the British fishing fleet if that is related to the number of fish in what was once the United Kingdom's exclusive fishing zone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I say that—particularly about the pelagic and beam sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister thinks that all the problems connected with designated ports can be solved as a result of the consultation exercise. Is it correct that in Kilkeel non-UK vessels are required to provide only two hours' notice of landing whereas similar UK vessels have to provide four hours' notice? Why should that be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is quite simple. We have introduced a national measure because we take our responsibilities as a national Government seriously. We have accepted our responsibilities in the European dimension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enforcement is a problem in certain parts of the UK fleet. Designated ports are one way of dealing with that. We do not have the same control over non-UK vessels, and I accept that the two hours' difference in reporting time is huge. However, the discussion on European measures may lead to standardisation on such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the new rules relating to the discarding of small fish, such fish will not be discarded immediately, but can be kept on board for 24 hours. By that time they would certainly be dead. If they are discarded immediately after they have been caught,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
their chances of recuperation are quite good; that is especially true of plaice and megrim, which do not have a swim bladder. Does the Minister share my anxieties about that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right about the biology. Some fishermen might make a legal catch of small fish, but they then make another catch of better quality, more marketable fish and are then tempted to dump the first catch to make room for the second. The measure is designed to stop that practice, by limiting such discards. I understand the anxiety of the hon. Member for Ludlow about discards; the Commission is trying to address the problems through such measures as these.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That brings us to the end of the time allotted for questions. We shall now proceed to the debate on the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 6123/98, a Commission Communication on Fisheries monitoring under the Common Fisheries Policy; also notes that the Communication builds on an undertaking given by the Commission to the Prime Minister at the Amsterdam European Council in June 1997: and endorses action being taken by the Government to secure more effective and consistent standards of enforcement across the Community.—[	<i>Mr. Morley.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Page 7 of the document states that the rules governing the market must help to safeguard resources—that is, to promote conservation. There are three problem areas relating to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first problem is that of minimum landing sizes; the second is the trade in undersized fish, which undoubtedly exists; the third problem is that of discards. All these problems militate against the safeguarding of resources. They are all against conservation, whereas many of the measures introduced by the European Union, under the common fisheries policy, are justified in terms of their value in conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer briefly to the matter of minimum landing sizes. On a previous occasion, the Minister will have seen me hold up this little cut out of a fish. It shows the minimum landing size for plaice proposed by the European Union. Fortunately, the EU was prevailed upon to reduce the minimum size from 25 cm to 22 cm, not 17 cm. That is still far too small, as it allows fish of a designated species to be caught before they have an opportunity to breed. That causes enormous damage to the prospects for conservation and for the regeneration of stocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum landing size has also been reduced for megrim. I draw the Committee's attention to the remarks of Lord Donoughue, in another place:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new size for megrim is a little smaller than strictly desirable but this recognises the fact that it is wasteful to require discarding of fish which are marketable and which in practice are caught as a part of a mixture of species."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 19 November 1997; Vol. 583, c. WA 80.]</p></blockquote>
I tried to make that point during the question time. We are dumping fish that are caught as part of a mixture of species and are marketable, yet at the same time we are reducing the minimum landing size to catch fish that
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
have not had an opportunity to breed. There is a suspicion among those who follow these matters that that has been done to accommodate the Spanish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my second point, which is my concern about the trade in undersized fish. Page 8 of document 6123/98 under the heading of minimum sizes states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main difficulties arise from landings of undersized fish intended for specific markets."</p></blockquote>
Current Community regulations already give national authorities powers but they are far from being exploited. In other words, nations have the power to deal with the problem but they do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recall that in January, on returning from Spain during the parliamentary recess, I threatened to show him an example of the sort of fish on sale in restaurants in Seville. One of those fish sits to this day on my desk in the cloisters in a coffee jar no bigger than the plastic cups in the Room. When my friends and I ordered plaice in a Seville restaurant we gave it no thought. We anticipated being served one plaice of the same dimensions as those that are customarily served in British restaurants. However, we were served with five or six tiny plaice, which were plainly illegal. The Spanish authorities have clearly done nothing to stop the practice. One can understand why: the little fish are sweet and popular. However, one suspects that the reduction of the minimum landing size is due to reasons other than those given by the Minister in answer to my questions. Document 6123/98 states that dealing with the problem
	<br><blockquote><p>"will also require a greater willingness to deploy the necessary means and co-ordinate the various authorities concerned, covering landings, transport, imports and marketing."</p></blockquote>
British fishermen want that applied universally throughout the European Union because they are sick and tired of being targeted with additional rules and regulations, which are placing an undue burden on their industry at a time when other fishing fleets are acting differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of discards, thousands of tonnes—representing millions of perfectly saleable fish—are being dumped back dead into the sea. They cannot be alive when they are thrown back because as I explained earlier, they are damaged, their swim bladder is destroyed and they cannot survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also referred earlier to a public hearing initiated by the European Parliament's Fisheries Committee. Experts from this and other countries told that committee that only 20 to 40 per cent. of the total amount of fish caught actually reaches consumers. The British public and the Committee ought to know about that statistic—a scandal at sea. It is offensive to most of us that so many fish are caught and then deliberately thrown back into the sea. It is an outrage against the marine environment and an affront to common sense. The policy is devoid of any sense of morality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members will doubtless vote for the measure: they will be whipped to do so. As they see it, they will vote to stamp out illegal practices in the fishing industry. However, the inevitable consequence of ending the practice of landing black fish will be even more dumping of prime adult fish to rot on the sea bed. Fishermen will continue to cast their nets at sea trying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
to catch those species and those quantities that they are allowed to land. So much for conservation and for the Labour party which so often lectures people about the environment, ecology, wildlife and sustainability. Do Labour Members have no conscience, or is it simply that they do not know what goes on in the name of the common fisheries policy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the office for official publications of the European Communities,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Common Fisheries Policy … responds to a host of legal, political, economic, social and environmental factors affecting both the fishing industry and the process of European integration."</p></blockquote>
I shall leave aside for a moment the reference to the fishing industry in the singular, which confirms that post-2002 there will be no British fishing fleet but just one European fishing fleet catching European fish in European waters—or, as the Minister understands it, equal access to a common resource. I shall also leave aside the reference to European integration, which is another issue. Is increased discarding of prime fish justified by legal, political, economic, social, environmental or other reasons?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the substance of the hon. Gentleman's questions when I reply. However, I emphasise, so that no one is misled, that there will be no single European fishing fleet post-2002 unless there is a proposal to introduce one—and there is none—and such a proposal is carried by a qualified majority of the Council of Ministers. I do not believe that it would be carried. The Government would strongly oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be out of order to respond to that intervention, because we are in Committee to discuss the new measures for enforcement. I have tried to confine my remarks at question time and in my speech to the question of discard and its effect on conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister, a politician with a very long record of concern for and involvement in animal welfare, reconcile himself to policies that will increase the senseless dumping of fresh fish back dead into the sea? Does he recognise that some hon. Members, irrespective of our views on European integration and other aspects of the common fisheries policy, cannot in all conscience bring ourselves to vote for measures that will compel fishermen to dump back dead in the sea a source of valuable protein, when in other parts of the world people are starving?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My questions are serious and important and I hope that the Minister will deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.43 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Humble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found this morning's questions and the Minister's answers very interesting, but much of the documentation deeply depressing. We are considering proposals concerning the common fisheries policy, but many European nations have precious little in common with regard to their monitoring and care of fish stocks. I notice that the Commission report on monitoring of fisheries policy states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"From the various submissions and reports forwarded by Member States, a wide variation in both the type and depth of controls conducted by national monitoring services is apparent."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
That is the understatement of the year. There is apparently no common definition of an inspector or an inspection; and no common analysis of the type or size of a fleet or how it is maintained. How, therefore, can we claim to operate a common fisheries policy in which fishermen feel that they are treated anything like equally?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anything emerges from the report, it is that there is greater consistency and transparency in the operation of the common fisheries policy. I agree with the hon. Member for Ludlow that British fishermen feel disadvantaged and picked on. They know that we have an efficient monitoring system. They have confidence in, and are treated fairly by, MAFF officials, but they feel that the way that this country operates within the common fisheries policy is not matched by other countries. The report confirms much of the anecdotal evidence that I have had from the fishermen who fish out of Fleetwood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the European countries that provided evidence for the report have acknowledged the system's deficiencies. Having done so, it is important to move on. I am disappointed that we have not received the updated report, and we do not want this unsatisfactory position to persist for much longer. If we want to reassure our fishermen we need to abide by the timetable that is referred to in the documents, and we need to ensure progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fishermen in Fleetwood are concerned about the control of black fish, although in general they recognise the importance of conservation. They know that without the necessary fish stocks they will be out of a job and that appropriate measures for conservation and control are needed. The recent proposals for coastal and regional state management highlight that, and I am pleased that they have received such widespread support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, Fleetwood fishermen are also concerned about the poor prices at auction markets. The report considers methods of improving the way that markets are run. If we can improve markets and the quality of fish that are landed, fishermen will get better prices. If they do, black fish might not be as important to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government' s designated landing ports scheme is important in controlling landings and it helps to improve monitoring of the fishing industry. The Minister will have received detailed observations from the Fleetwood fishermen, which I shall not repeat. One of the most important aspects of that scheme is the fact that those ports will become centres of excellence, which we discussed earlier. I hope that Fleetwood will become a regional centre. It already has a thriving market, which contains processors and associated businesses. More businesses are coming to the market, there are hopes for greater expansion and there will be further improvements through the designated landing ports scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that Great Britain and other European countries make those improvements to the common fisheries policy and that we work with our European colleagues. It is also essential that we involve our fishermen. If they do not believe that their views have been heard, that they will be treated fairly and that their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
European colleagues will work under similar monitoring and regulatory regimes, they will not accept the proposal. I hope that they accept our assurances. I also hope that the common fisheries policy will operate efficiently and that our British fishing industry will go from strength to strength.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.47 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To tell the Minister that he is doing a better job than the last lot may sound a little like damning with faint praise, but doing worse would involve a very concerted effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some progress has been made on multi-annual guidance programmes and, to a certain extent, on quota settlements. I am glad that a cultural change is gradually taking place in the industry and that we are moving away from what I previously called Thatcherism at sea. Typically, fishermen said, "If I don't get out there and grab what I can, some other bugger will." That could be generously interpreted as meaning a desire for equality of opportunity at sea or equality of monitoring, which is important for the industry's future. The fishermen's interpretation will be, "If I am not permitted to go out and fish, why should anyone else have a better opportunity?" That is the key for the future of the common fisheries policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The development of more effectively and consistent standards of enforcement across the Community is the main priority".</p></blockquote>
I agree, but how can it be achieved? I asked whether the EU inspectorate should be built up and/or whether member states should have more open access to inspection in other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome some of the comments in the document, one of which is that exchange of information must be increased "as rapidly as possible". We must create an environment in which that is seen not as a threat but as an opportunity for member states. We must be aware of the diplomatic problems if the matter is approached in the wrong way. It is important that the approach is correct and the language is suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the Government's are better at the spin than the substance of politics. Perish the thought that the Minister goes along with that, but he may like to present the development of an open-door policy on inspections in other member states as an opportunity for member states to show off their efficiency and effectiveness and not as something cold and threatening. Inspections must take place without prior notice and the system must be the same for everyone. There should still be a build up of the EU inspectorate because its role is clearly necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential point that I want to emphasise is that equality of monitoring is more important than the methods of control. If demonstrable equality of monitoring is established, whatever method is used would be acceptable to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point concerns the resources available to the United Kingdom fleet to instal new satellite equipment on their vessels. If the system is to be established by 1 January 2000, the Government will have completed their comprehensive spending review and the two years of constraint on Government spending will have passed. I hope that they will
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
recognise that the investment is well worth the effort and that the industry will benefit greatly from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge the Minister's view that taking mackerel handliners and other so-called conservation fishing out of the quota system would result in over-fishing in the sector. Even when there were many more handliners in Cornwall, Devon and other places than now, they were never a threat to stocks. Mackerel have been threatened by other fishing methods, not by handlining. Handlining is not efficient for large boats that have invested in gear for a different form of fishing. I challenge the idea that taking conservation fishing such as mackerel handlining out of the quota system would be a threat to stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of the proposals will be effective unless we achieve equality of enforcement and monitoring across the EU. That will be achieved only through an open door policy. I welcome the Government's efforts to pursue that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not a great deal divides members of the Committee on the need for uniform and proper enforcement of the complex rules and regulations that are the common fisheries policy. I was delighted to hear the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) pick up on my theme. The Minister will be aware of the odd way in which the Fisheries Council operates and of the language and broad-brush terms that are used by many of our partners to describe their positions. He may have felt a tinge of annoyance at their lack of willingness—I see him nodding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, laughing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have felt a little annoyed that member states were not more specific about how measures would be implemented. I do not want to live in the past, but when I tried to pin down the French fishing Minister on an aspect of policy, he could not answer me. His first secretary and his deputy were also unable to give me an answer. The Minister decided that there should be a meeting of officials later that day to resolve the issue about the possible closure of fishery to French fishermen. In spite of some meticulous probing by the United Kingdom, he was still unable to come up with an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental difference between what other member states, in the nicest sense, think that they can get away with and what we do. Our fishermen sometimes feel that the weight of regulations and, indeed, of a raft of new regulations, some of which have good intentions, place an unnecessary burden on them. They know that in other parts of the Community—the Commission's report attests to this—the regulations are not being enforced with the same attention to meticulous detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a worry because it confers on our competitors an unfair advantage. The regulations are part of the management of a scarce resource—the fish in the sea. Quotas establish the amount of fish that member states can take. The regulations, by and large, are designed to ensure that people stick to the quotas and account for what they have taken as their share of the sea's resources. It allows us to track what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
The regulations are designed to stop fishermen cheating. The Commission's report rightly draws our attention to the fact that one fisherman's cheating is another fisherman's lost income. That penny is beginning to drop among our fishermen, whose views—for example, on black fish—are often more enlightened. But the deep suspicion remains that elsewhere in the Community, things are not as they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One theme highlighted by the Minister was his hope that the new regulation, which is appended to the documents, would be the way forward. As the person who fought and won in the Council for the report to be produced, I share and sympathise with the concern of the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood that the document was again delayed. I put my hands up and admit to the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George), who chastised the previous Administration, that we were not perfect, but we took a leading role in enforcement to improve the situation. Much of the practical side of regulation No. 2847/93 has British handwriting all over it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report was an attempt to crack open what was happening in other member states. The Minister will know that our fisheries inspectors have intercourse in the communicative sense with themselves and other inspectors, both in the role that they fulfil occasionally as Community inspectors and in the contact that they have with each other. He will be aware that they are a valuable source of intelligence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be useful if the Minister could provide the House with an inspectors' assessment of the weaknesses of the enforcement regime in Europe. Although the 1996 report, which is appended to the documents, is an interesting accumulation of facts, it is short of detail on the effectiveness of enforcement. It refers to diminishing transparency and provides some relevant numerical information, but it does not say much about the quality of enforcement. The later report, which forms the basis of our debate, is, in Community terms, a candid indictment of the failure of member states—I am delighted to see the Minister nodding—properly to enforce a regulation agreed in 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the implementation date was some time after that but, given that this is 1998 and we are debating this report and some further ideas, I doubt whether it is worth loading this sector with even more regulations if—as the report shows—we cannot make the existing package work properly. The United Kingdom has a clear and important role to play in this area, which is why I was pressing the Minister. I was not pressing him to score cheap points or to criticise—I, too, acknowledge that he takes a proper interest in this subject—but to stress that the United Kingdom has an enviable reputation in the Community of worrying away at points of detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission must tell us how its wish list is to be addressed. Much of what the Minister said was couched in general phrases, which we all use to show that we are sympathetic to an idea but do not have a cat in hell's chance of providing details of implementation,
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
timetable or drawbacks. Page 10 of the Commission's report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission's work is also hampered by several other factors. The first is the limited human resources at its disposal. This has been all the more serious because the Commission has had to devote a very large part of its resources to specific problems with repercussions beyond the European Union".</p></blockquote>
It then refers to North American Fishing Organisation issues and driftnets, which are beyond the scope of this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission admits that its effort and energy in devoting resources—the use of the Commission's inspectorate—has been found wanting. I can remember when the Commission decided to put effort and energy into sorting out the difficulties over the administration of the tuna fisheries some years ago. Those difficulties suddenly faded as a result of the Commission's full engagement. But the report—the Commission's own report—contains no sign of such a full engagement. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a Member State does not co-operate with the Commission to clear up a dispute, it will be very difficult for it to gather the required information without investing prohibitive levels of human resources."</p></blockquote>
I would be the first to understand that the Commission—in the same way as the United Kingdom Government—will always have finite resources. The reason why I picked those quotations is that we can all make glowing statements about what we would like to happen. Regulation No. 2847/93—should anyone care to read it—contains the same sort of language that has been deployed in this debate: conservation, transparency, implementation. I could go on at length. Five years on, we are debating how to implement the common fisheries policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's first priority—even though our European Union presidency has only one more month to run—must be to try to establish a specific course of action to address questions of transparency and correct implementation in member states, rather than to simply agree to more regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the document is a candid exposé. The Minister accused me of living in the past, although I doubt whether he meant to be too unkind. I am not living in the past, given that I am commenting on a document that was produced in February 1998. The document clearly illustrates the failings at member state level with regard to implementation. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Major differences still exist between member states as regards the means deployed for carrying out controls at sea."</p></blockquote>
The Council of Ministers should ask member states to make a public commitment on their intention to tackle those issues. The Minister knows that community member inspectors have many tasks to perform. In Spain, for example, they are part of the customs organisation. Unlike our inspectors, they do not spend all their time considering fishing issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document considers a number of other issues. We have discussed MAGP. the report states clearly that the assessment of fishing-vessel power lacks uniformity and depth. The Minister is conscious of that issue, and he is tackling it in the United Kingdom. He is doing what every good fishery Minister should do. Nevertheless, the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is above all a general problem as regards standardising the way in which engine power is measured".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Through its regulations, and through activities of member states such as satellite surveillance, the Commission is able to pick on any farmer's field and to dispute what is grown in it to determine whether the farmer gets paid. However, five years on, the regulations that govern the common fisheries policy continue to fail to provide a uniform way of assessing the horse power of vessels. That is an indictment. I hope that the Minister will pursue the matter objectively. I have no doubt that he is fully committed to improving the way in which the regulations are implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow is a zealot on the question of fish sizes. If the post of a fisheries inspector were to fall vacant, my hon. Friend might volunteer. He would be very good at it, and could become an honorary inspector of fisheries with unmatched zeal. He will have noticed a remarkable commentary in the report, on the difficulties arising from the landing of undersized fish. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Priority should be given to eliminating these marketing channels".</p></blockquote>
It continues by considering the role of consumers, and asks what member states can do. I wonder about the reaction of the Spanish people with whom my hon. Friend dined, were they to receive a leaflet from the Spanish Government that said, "Please do not buy this small fish." Such consumer education is pie in the sky. That is the kind of nonsense that is spoken in the Fisheries Council when the implementation of regulations is discussed. It undermines credibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report is candid, and I congratulate the Commission on having the courage to produce it because it illustrates the weaknesses in enforcement, which is not carried out in the way that members of the Committee want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that we have had the late delivery of the latest report shows that the issues are not being taken seriously. Member states will be late in making returns and the Commission does not have the resources to process the information. The report is a toothless tiger. I hope that if I table a parliamentary question asking the Minister for details of what he intends to do, he will be as good as his earlier nods and smiles and will provide us with the relevant information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I contacted the fishing industry, it highlighted the problems of inconsistency, the lack of resources for satellite monitoring and the issue of engine power. It reminded me that independent experts had been appointed by the Commission to address the scale of the problems. Will the Commission's report be published to enable us to see what has been going on? In the spirit of transparency, I am sure that the Commission will be only too pleased to put that proposal to the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fishing industry has also raised some questions about designated ports. The Minister will have received representations on ports such as Kilkeel, Brixham, Newlyn, Lowestoft and North Shields and will be aware of the industry's questions about large vessels. Will he therefore undertake to publish at the end of the consultation exercise a parliamentary answer that deals with specific concerns about hours of landing and availability of inspectors? Will he also respond to the points about markets determining when fishermen want to land and the conflict that may create with the points
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
made about designated ports? That juxtaposes with the problem of four hours' notice. The Minister is clearly aware of the fishing industry's concerns, but it would like a detailed response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On practicalities, the fishing industry pointed out to me that there is little justification for specific landing locations in Scarborough when the harbour can be seen from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food inspector's offce. It has gone into detail on that matter, and it would help if the Minister considered its concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish industry also asked me to raise some points. The Minister was kind enough to tiptoe up to one of its key concerns, namely control of the Norwegian fleet. Is the Minister willing to propose a change of policy in the Council, so that Norwegian vessels would have to report directly to EU member states. I am sure that the industry is pleased to hear that the Minister is sympathetic to that view, but can sympathy be turned into action by pursuing the policy with a little more rigour?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish industry raised specific points about amendments to the regulation. It is concerned that third-country vessels will be able to fish in our waters without there being a requirement for satellite monitoring. Will the Minister respond, either in his wind-up speech or in correspondence, to help the industry understand the more detailed requirements of amendment No. 24 to the regulation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 31 would remove the derogation whereby vessels between 10 m and 17 m in registered length, fishing for less than 24 hours, are not currently required to complete a logbook. On that, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst understanding the rationale for removing this derogation, the Federation remains opposed in principle to this proposal".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister respond to the industry's concerns on that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's colleagues north of the border have sent the industry detailed information about the amendments to the regulation. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow that minimum landing sizes are crucial. Stocks are the seed corn of a fishery and if they are abused, there are long-term implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 requires those responsible for selling or transporting fish to show the origin of fish that are less than the minimum landing size permitted by Community legislation. The amendment exhibits a conflict between landing and not landing such fish; and I wonder whether Spain, where such breaches of the regulations clearly take place, will report breaking of the rules there. Will the Minister tell us how the amendment will work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are there any no-go areas for Community inspectors? Unless they can go wherever they want whenever they want, as the revised regulations suggest, openness and transparency will not exist in certain key areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support amendment No. 29. Anything that improves co-operation and understanding between member states and their inspectorates is to be applauded. The interchange of inspectors and an appreciation of their respective responsibilities points the way to progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's proposal refers to lots of monitoring and then to coming back in three years to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
tell us whether the regulations are working. Will the Minister press for a far more rigorous reporting system in the Council? The long time scales involved simply mean that the mañana mentality, which has typified the approach, will carry on for ever and a day. The deep suspicion will gnaw away at the hearts and minds of our fishermen that cheating takes place, that their interests are not being safeguarded and that others are not playing by the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall support the Minister's efforts to try to ensure that enforcement is uniform across the Community. As the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood said when she spoke of the practical aspects of implementation, it is essential that enforcement be carried out properly. If it is not, there is no use piling regulations on top of each other. They will just become so much paper that will not provide a properly enforced common fisheries policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.18 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Question time and the debate have identified the common ground in the Committee about the need for an effective regime of pan-European enforcement of the obligations of the common fisheries policy. Many fishing organisations to which I have spoken have made that point vociferously; and the hon. Members for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and for St. Ives (Mr. George) confirm that fishing organisations hold similar views in different parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that all member states, including the United Kingdom, are under an obligation to smarten up their act and provide the enforcement regime that is required. That may be fair comment, but we need to make our fishing organisations more aware of where this and other countries are deficient. Although the Minister's comments may be accurate, fishing organisations in this country believe that we are disproportionately better at enforcing the obligations of the common fisheries policy than other member states. A confidence-building exercise is required, so that fishing organisations understand the relative enforcement performance of member states. I welcome the pressure to entrench enforcement on an EU-wide basis, but the quid pro quo for it must be transparency in the regime and the ability of fishing organisations in this country to see what other countries are up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How to deliver effective enforcement is the $64 million question. The hon. Member for St. Ives asked how to guarantee such enforcement. The Commission document deals with relevant priorities. The first of the six that need to be tackled in 1998 is
	<br><blockquote><p>"acting forcefully under the existing regulations to put an end to the most serious shortcomings (incomplete application by sonic Member States of the rules on basic documents, including putting them on computer, incorrect catch declarations, and above all repeated overfishing of quotas for certain stocks)".</p></blockquote>
The breakdown in the enforcement of these regulations sounds fundamental, if that is the top priority for 1998. We would all agree that if that is an accurate account of the situation, the problem must be pursued by the Commission and the European Union. It suggests that we have a long way to go before effective enforcement
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
is delivered. The scale of the task should not be underestimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear the Minister talk about his sympathy for regional coastal management. There is an argument for putting in place the correct framework for enforcement at EU level, but also for giving individual fisheries effective powers to ensure that those fisheries are managed and policed by the member states with the primary interest in the area. That would help the situation in the North sea by allowing some of the problems caused by Norwegian fleets to be tackled within a management framework. That is certainly an aspiration of Scottish fishing organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can provide me with further information about two specific issues. The first is about inspection standards and rules. Several questions have been asked about the difficulty of enforcing a regime when so many of the starting-points are on different parts of the track. We need more information about the measures that are taken to set inspection standards and to define the rules. If inspection standards and rules are set out but not enforced, it is easier to see where progress come from. If a process has to be gone through to define the standards because they are so widely varied across EU member states, the scale of the task becomes much greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is penalties—the flip side of enforcement. I quote again from the Commission document:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission is therefore unable to guarantee the effectiveness of penalties and even-handed application by the Member States. Even the lists of infringements are too unlike each other to be useful. In addition, the information sent is more often than not incomplete, or is sent so late as to be largely useless."</p></blockquote>
As before, that suggests a fundamental weakness in the current regime. There is a need for the deterrence of practices that are of concern to the Commission, the Council and to this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point, which arises from the Minister's welcome comments, relates to the need for fishing organisations fully to participate in the formulation of Government and EU policy in this sphere. The people who are involved have great expertise and ability, and their talents of energy and quality should be captured in the years ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for my earlier absence from the Committee. I was taking part in a Select Committee press conference. I also apologise for the distressing noise from my new mobile telephone. I cannot understand why it went off, because it was already turned off. I have now removed the batteries, so we will not be disturbed again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My comments concern the structure of the common agricultural policy. To me, the CAP appears to have been an economic and environmental disaster. It treats the resources of the sea as common property. I believe that that goes against human nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a shame that I have not been here for the whole debate, but few hon. Members have discussed the problem of discards. [HON. MEMBERS: "It was discussed in your absence."] I apologise in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Dutch inquiry shows that heavy beam trawlers discard 270,000 tonnes a year of mature, edible fish and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
dispose of 120,000 tonnes of shellfish on the seabed. It calculates that 10 kg of fish are destroyed for every kilogram that is brought ashore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These extraordinary figures relate to the nature of the quota system, which does not allow for the fact that one cannot predict what will come up when one puts a net in the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Scottish port of Fraserburgh, Mr. George Haddan' s boat "Utility" dumped 200 boxes of mature haddock with a value of over £40,000 and representing five days' work. To me that is a scandal. Nothing in the document that we have been discussing suggests that the system will improve, because it will still depend on quotas. The problem of black fish in the channel will remain. It is crazy that French fishermen are allocated 76 per cent. of the quota, and British fishermen only 8 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the weekend newspapers revealed that Keith Schofield from Newhaven is dumping 1,000 cod, worth £8,000, a week. That goes against common sense. Inevitably, a thriving black market has sprung up. Designated ports will not solve that problem. People do not want to throw away discards and they will still try to sell them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A DG XIV internal report of 1991 covered a midterm review of the common fisheries policy. It said that discards—of which there were 460 million—almost equalled the figure of 500 million landed fish. The Commission's reaction was ever fiercier surveillance. However, that has not worked—my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow has told us how he met some "heavy hombres" in Corunna. That encounter showed that Community inspectors are not functioning there. However, paragraph (25) of article 28h in the proposal for a Council regulation (EC) calls for extraordinarily severe powers to be given to Community inspectors. It states that they
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have access to the relevant files and documents and to public premises and places, vessels and private premises, land and means of transport".</p></blockquote>
That access is demanded in the name of a failed policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contrast with Norway could not be more marked. Discards are banned there: all caught fish must be landed. As a result, Norwegian fish stocks are increasing. Other countries are fishing there and are landing fish in Norwegian ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lesson is that ownership of fish should belong to those who are exploiting the resource. Fishermen are treated like rogues and criminals. The fishing press has used the headline "Regulated to Death!". Sherryl Murray, who is the chairman of the south-western fisheries producers organisation, has said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Fishermen are regarded as statistics to be shuffled around, instead of real people doing real, honest jobs. My husband is a fishermen and I can assure you the last thing he thinks about when he goes to sea is breaking rules. He's thinking about earning a living and providing sustenance for his family."</p></blockquote>
Some fishermen in Northern Ireland are subject to inspection by five navies. They are also inspected by other bodies, such as MAFF, marine safety, health and safety, customs, coastguards, the DSS and the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that we are doing in our discussion of the document is reinforcing failure. In the dying days of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
Government's presidency of the EU, will the Minister consider another way forward? Aristotle said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those things which are owned by the greatest number of people are the least well cared for."</p></blockquote>
The policy is a classic example of that statement. We seem unable to discuss any alternative. Let us consider the industry in other seafaring countries; for example, the lobster producers in Maine, fishermen in Cozumel in Mexico, the long-standing Japanese fishing cooperatives, or the French co-operatives, the "Prud'homies". In all these cases, it is clear that when fishermen are given ownership, and title to the sea, they will look after it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In New Zealand, during the 1980s, there were the same problems as we have at present: falling fish stocks, huge subsidies, problems with quotas and a black market. However, in the mid-1980s those problems were solved, because individual transferable quotas were introduced. Subsidies have stopped, fish stocks have increased and more people are employed in the fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The New Zealand solution is not the answer to everyone's dreams; it probably does not go far enough. The individual transferable quotas do not just give the right to fish; they give a certain ownership to the sea for those involved. That is in total contrast to our current common fisheries policy, which only gives a right to fish. As Aristotle said, it is human nature not to consider the future of something that one does not own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European quota favours those who manage to haggle away successfully. The fishing Minister who returns with the biggest quota for his nation is praised. His fishermen then go out and grab as much of that quota as they can. As we have seen from the figures that I quoted earlier, they also throw away almost half as much fish again. That would not happen if some form of long-term, permanent and marketable title to the sea was given to those involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an interesting example from the New Zealand industry, regarding a fish called the orange roughy. It lives for over 100 years and would appear to be one of the least suitable products for long-term investment. However, those fishermen with ITQs for orange roughy have formed co-operatives and set up a research association. As a result, stocks and sales of orange roughy are increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a lesson for us in that example. We should not thunder down the route proposed by the document, with ever more manic surveillance, resulting in headlines in the fishing press such as "Regulate to Death". Surely, we should consider a solution based on subsidiarity, with repatriation to the communities whose members fish and exploit the sea. That would not exclude other countries, whether they are from the EU, or from outside. Some form of ITQ would be a marketable, long-term solution. Will the Minister consider these points?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a most interesting and wide-ranging discussion. Many hon. Members have considerable knowledge of the fishing areas that they represent and have spoken on behalf of their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
I shall deal first with the issues that were raised by the hon. Member for Ludlow. I assure the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) that the issue of discards was raised comprehensively while he was out of the Room. The hon. Member for Ludlow was so enthusiastic that we have decided that he will resign his seat to take up a post at our sea fish inspectorate and join the Aberdeen night shift to ensure that there is no messing around. We look forward to his application as we are sure that he will be an excellent addition to our fisheries enforcement team.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ludlow asked serious questions about undersized fish, discards and minimum landing sizes. I answered many of those questions, and share many of his concerns—very real issues about minimum landing sizes must be dealt with. We opposed the reduction because we felt that that sent the wrong signal. The question of discards needs to be considered in that context. We also need to consider various questions about technical conservation gear, including mesh sizes and square mesh panels. The fishing industry advocated or pioneered the use of some of those procedures, and we wish to follow their lead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to use the undoubted problem of discards to argue that we should not deal with the black fish issue—basically, that involves a cheat's charter. The right hon. Member for Fylde rightly said that those who land black fish are stealing fish from other fishermen, and we cannot tolerate that. When we were elected we said that we wanted to tackle the black fish issue—we have done so and we shall continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to discards, the bulk of the fish that are discarded—Opposition Members were right to say that large quantities are involved—are not over-quota marketable fish but undersized, non-target species, which are a by-catch for fishermen. We need to deal with that problem. The document's proposals relating to enforcement mean that this is not the most appropriate context in which to take effective action, but the problem will not go away. For some time I have been concerned about the fact that we discard marketable fish in large quantities and I remain open-minded about possible solutions. Some of the proposals, which were criticised today, are designed to deal with that problem and, although we have some way to go, I am sure that we will continue to make progress. That is not an excuse for this country, as a member state, to fail to tackle our black fish problems—we shall not shirk our duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document, which usefully identifies areas that need improvement, contains a full and frank confession about the European Union's failings. As a member state, we are not immune to all of those criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood described those failings. I agree that it is disappointing that the 1996 report was delayed—it was not complete—but I shall continue to press for improvements in the way that the Commission produces reports on fishing and fisheries enforcement. I shall tell the Council of Ministers that reports should be
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
produced earlier and that they should contain more details. My hon. Friend argued that if fisheries enforcement is to be successful it must be seen to be fairly and uniformly applied across the Community. That is the document's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for St. Ives, who represents a major fishing port, said that the last thing the fishing industry needs is a free-for-all, in which there is no quality control or enforcement. I agree that the Commission has an important role to play as an independent arbiter—it will help to ensure that member states enforce the rules. The fact that it commissioned some welcome reports, which have identified some of those failings, is a welcome step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, who is not here at present, would have been interested to learn that under our presidency we recently hosted a meeting in Portsmouth of the fisheries directors. At that meeting, we painted a picture of what this country, as a member state, was doing in fisheries enforcement. They had a tour aboard one of our fisheries enforcement ships and met members of the fisheries protection squadron. I think that they were impressed by the commitment and dedication that we put into fisheries enforcement. The meeting was a useful part of the exchange of information that we want to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty with the handliner issue is that although it is a low-impact fishery, and I am supportive of it, it has a finite quota that is not very large. I want the quota to be increased. An extra 300 tonnes has recently been granted to the mackerel handliners, which was much appreciated. But there is an issue of effort even in that sector. For example, some handliners are equipping their boats with automatic baiting machines which will increase efficiency and efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not an option to allow mackerel handliners and other coastal fisheries to take care of themselves. We cannot say that they do not need quota control. Effort will increase and other fishermen, who are good at identifying a fishing opportunity, will get straight into that sector. We cannot ignore mackerel handliners and other coastal fisheries, but the Department is considering the allocation of quota and ways in which to help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the comments made by the right hon. Member for Fylde, I do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in the Council of Ministers if we want to make progress. He was right to say that member states might say something that sounds good but not do very much about it. I must emphasise, however, that I am greatly encouraged by the fact that every member state, without exception, recognises that there is a need to improve fisheries enforcement. That was not always the case because some member states were reluctant to discuss the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a change of atmosphere in the Council of Ministers which is associated with the change of Government. There is now a more constructive atmosphere. Although we are firm on ensuring that we have our own national agendas, we are also prepared to work in a constructive and responsible way with our European partners. I would not criticise the right hon. Gentleman, who has taken a reasonable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
and pragmatic approach to Europe. I hope that he escapes the cull of members of his party who have a similar attitude. It is a great shame that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), who made a useful and constructive contribution to the debate, was forced to resign from his party's Front Bench. That was a great loss for his party. It is sad that people with his views feel that there is no place for them. The right hon. Member for Fylde would also be a loss to the Tory Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is a need for better reporting, and I have undertaken to pass that message on. We need to clarify the detail and to recognise that levels of enforcement stand indicted. I accept that a great deal of work needs to be done, but the proposals are a beginning. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we will continue our work in the Council meeting on 8 June. That work will continue in the meetings between our officials, the Commission and officials of other countries. We intend to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the right hon. Member for Fylde that we are addressing the problem of horsepower. It is possible that our work might be useful to the Commission's independent report. I see no reason why its report on horsepower should not be in the public domain as part of our commitment to transparency. I am happy to explore that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members mentioned designated ports. We have tried to ensure that our responses have been flexible. Both the ports and people who have written to us with their concerns will receive detailed answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Fylde asked about third-country vessels. It is intended that all such vessels fishing in European waters will have the same satellite equipment at the same deadline, which is the year 2000. There will be no exceptions to that, so it will also apply to the Norwegian fleet. The right hon. Gentleman also asked about log books for smaller vessels. Derogation has occurred in that respect, and he rightly represented the industry's view on the matter. The maximum amount of detail is required for the purposes of fisheries management and enforcement, and the Commission has taken the right approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) said that there is a feeling that this country enforces the rules rigorously and effectively and other countries do not. We have a good record on fisheries enforcement, and I am proud of that and of the men and women who work for the Ministry, the navy and the various protection agencies. I accept, however, that all is not perfect in our own industry and that we still have work to do. We are determined to tackle the problems that we face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report has identified problems of enforcement in other countries, and we will be interested to see what action member states take to address their problems. We cannot, however, ignore our own problems. If we did, other member states would say, "Why should we listen to your arguments about improving enforcement when there are glaring deficiencies in some aspects of your own enforcement regime?" We cannot and will not allow that to happen. We are determined to put our own house in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire asked about the need for regulations. We are trying to strike a balance. There are many regulations in the fishing industry on matters such as health and safety, standard of vessel construction, hygiene and conservation. I accept that, by its nature, it is a highly regulated industry. We want to strike a balance between the need for regulations and the need for flexibility and recognising the patterns of fishing, which was the intention behind our designated ports proposals. That is why larger boats only were included and fishermen have not been stopped from landing at other ports or at different times of the day or night. All fishermen must do is give four hours' notice, which can be given at sea, in port, on the way into port or whatever they like. It is a flexible approach. Although any such change will put some new burdens on the industry, they will not be excessive, and fishermen working within the rules have nothing to fear from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for North Shropshire asked about ITQs. They are not uncontroversial within the fishing industry. There are two sides to the argument, and I have heard both being put. There are complications with ITQs—their effects have implications for small fisheries-dependent regions—and those issues cannot be ignored. ITQs work in some countries, and I shall have the opportunity in the not-too-distant future to talk to the Icelandic fishing Minister about the operation there. Even in countries with ITQs, there is a strand of opinion that says that they are not entirely successful. They are not necessarily the ideal answer, and any such proposal must be considered carefully. The hon. Gentleman should be aware that they are controversial within the British fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful discussion on a document that is an important step in improving Europe-wide fisheries enforcement. It is unfair to criticise the document for identifying problems and suggesting improvements. It is good that it has identified failings and recommended improvements. I accept that clarification is needed, but one of the problems of the old enforcement rules, under which there was disparity of enforcement, is identified in the document. In many cases there was no agreed criteria for enforcement and enforcement standards. One of the biggest improvements represented in the document is the recognition of the difficulty of applying enforcement equally throughout member states and measuring that enforcement when there is no common standard to use as a benchmark. The proposal is that benchmarks and common standards should be established so that we can compare enforcement by member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that work is necessary to agree the benchmarks, but that is under way and we, as the Government and a member state, are committed to making progress with the report and having the system up and running by the 1999 deadline, so that uniform enforcement can be established throughout the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
