	<div class='legislation'>Cocoa and Chocolate</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to discuss the new directive on cocoa and chocolate products for human consumption. The European Commission's proposals were published in May 1996 in document 8164/96. They aim to simplify and update the current directive that dates from 1973 and to set out the provisions necessary for the proper operation of a single market for chocolate in the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee might find it helpful if I give a few background details. The 1973 directive, which, of course, would have been negotiated at that time on the basis of Britain's entry into the European Community, allows the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark to incorporate up to 5 per cent. vegetable fats, other than cocoa butter, in chocolate. That practice is similar to that used in Portugal, Sweden, Finland and Austria, although other member states prohibit the use of vegetable fats by manufacturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive also provides a derogation allowing the United Kingdom and Ireland to sell in their own countries—but not throughout the Community—milk chocolate that is made with more milk and less cocoa than in the rest of the European Union. However, if such chocolate is exported, it must be called something different and some countries require it to be labelled in what we consider to be a derogatory way, such as "household milk chocolate".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that a new directive should respect all the different traditions of chocolate-making in Europe, of which there are many. They should provide maximum choice for consumers. The issue of vegetable fats is also important for the United Kingdom, as small additions of speciality non-cocoa fats have been made by the United Kingdom chocolate industry for 50 years. That is not to enable manufacturers to make cheap and nasty products—just the opposite. Such practice allows for a more diverse range of products with better handling and keeping characteristics of the chocolate, tailored to meet the needs of British consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, for more than 90 years in Britain a variety of milk chocolate has been made with a much higher proportion of milk than is used on the continent. It is fairly obvious what that variety of chocolate is—"Cadbury's Dairy Milk". It has a higher-value formulation and is an important part of the United Kingdom's chocolate-making tradition, and, indeed, some would say our heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
The new proposals allow each member state to decide whether to authorise the use of non-cocoa vegetable fats up to a maximum of 5 per cent. provided that the existing minimum percentages of cocoa butter and cocoa solids are met. However, there must be a declaration on the label in addition to the ingredients list that the chocolate contains other vegetable fats. The derogation for the United Kingdom and Irish milk chocolate is retained. All products conforming to the directive are explicitly entitled to free circulation as "chocolate" throughout the Community—that is, the single market. With one or two reservations, the Government can support the proposals. Our reservations include double labelling, which we do not consider to be entirely necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under article 100a, the proposal is subject to co-decision with the European Parliament. After a long delay, the Parliament completed its first reading last October and proposed several amendments, which I must make absolutely clear that the United Kingdom cannot, and will not, accept. In particular, the amendments seek to deny the United Kingdom the right to continue to use the term "milk chocolate" for our high-milk product and require a statement about the use of vegetable fats on the front of the product as well as on the ingredients list. That is part of the attempt to use derogatory labelling. We agree—as much as anyone, and more than most—that consumers must be properly informed of the contents. That is the purpose of an ingredients list. We believe that it is for manufacturers to decide where to print such information, but they usually put it all together on the back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament voted to make the coming into force of the directive dependent on the development of a new method of analysis of vegetable fats. In fact, existing methods are no less precise than those for the other ingredients of chocolate. That vote, therefore, has every appearance of being a delaying tactic employed by those who do not wish to see a genuine single market for chocolate and who want to stop British products reaching those parts of the European Union to which they have not hitherto been exported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has indicated that it rejects all the European Parliament's amendments, which is wholly in line with Government policy—and, I suspect, with the views of the House of Commons. However, the Commission does not reject those amendments relating to subsidiarity on the use of vegetable fat, which should be up to the country concerned, on the free movement of goods and the protection of consumer interests through proper labelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Commission will soon publish an amended proposal taking account of the European Parliament's opinion. Frankly, the Government had expected that to be published before today, which would have made our debate more meaningful. Nevertheless, we expect to receive it within days, and we expect there to be relatively few changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from making two or three small clarifications to the text, the Commission is likely to propose that chocolate containing non-cocoa vegetable fats should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
be labelled with a "conspicuous and legible statement" in addition to the ingredients list and separate from it. As long as it is there and can be clearly read, its positioning should be left to the manufacturers. I expect all the other amendments proposed by the European Parliament, including the removal of the United Kingdom's milk chocolate derogation, to be rejected by the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall provide the Scrutiny Committee with a further explanatory memorandum as soon as we have the Commission text. Although we remain strongly opposed to double labelling, we shall, as the Presidency, examine the new proposals in a genuinely constructive spirit to see what further compromises may be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very emotive subject, and reaching an agreement in Brussels will not be easy. I make it absolutely clear that the Government will not agree to any solution that discriminates against traditional British products or that narrows the effective range of choice of British consumers. We simply will not have it; and we will not support it. However, as the presidency, we shall do our utmost to search for a genuinely inclusive solution, which accommodates all the different chocolate-making traditions in the Community within a fair and genuine single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter has obviously been debated in the European Parliament, and it was part of the Government's role to brief the United Kingdom's European Members of Parliament. I have made available to the Committee the same brief that we provided to our MEPs. Although it was produced in August, I hope that the information that it contains is helpful. I certainly hope that the Government will have the support of all parties on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his introductory remarks; indeed, he has already answered some of my questions. He spoke of the European Parliament's series of amendments, which, to the United Kingdom, can only be described as wrecking amendments. He referred specifically to the proposal that the directive would not come into force until a test for vegetable fat had been found. I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that that is not acceptable to Britain, but what was the Commission's response?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister know whether such a test is being developed and what sort of time scale is involved? If, despite his best endeavours, the European Parliament amendment were carried and therefore became part of the directive, what would be the status of our current exemption before the new directive came into operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a wholly fair question. The Commission has commissioned research, which is referred to in paragraph 8 of the brief to MEPs, into methods of checking the amount of vegetable fat in chocolate—although vegetable fat is something of a misnomer because we are talking about only the inclusion of up to 5 per cent. of non-cocoa vegetable fats. The minimum cocoa content of chocolate is 40 per cent., but chocolate includes many other ingredients. The test for checking those other ingredients has not changed and the question of its accuracy is not an issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked into that research because it concerns the UK and because the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is co-operating with it. The British end of the research is a collaborative project that is being funded by my Ministry and which is being carried out at the Central Science Laboratory in Norwich. Until it is concluded, we believe that the test is unnecessary because the method of checking for vegetable fats is no different from that of checking for other non-cocoa ingredients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure when the research will be finished; there is a problem with end dates for Commission research projects not being given. However, it need not hold up matters. The existing tests are sufficient and until the results of the Commission research into the possibility of more accurate tests are available, we cannot take matters further forward. I believe that the European Commission will reject all the European Parliament's proposals, including our one on the test. However, the Commission went ahead and commissioned research in case a more accurate measure could be found—which would, admittedly, be of benefit in checking the non-cocoa element of chocolate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. However, my final point was that if—I accept that it is a hypothetical situation—the Council of Ministers decided, despite the endeavours of our Ministers and perhaps those of the Commission, to accept the European Parliament amendment on the test, we would be in a period of interregnum before the new directive came into force. Can the Minister assure us that our existing exemptions for milk chocolate and the use of vegetable fat will continue until the new directive comes into force?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Without taking advice, I can say that that must be the case. We are happy with the present test. Until the Commission has an agreed new system, the present system must continue and we would support that because we do not question its accuracy. We think that the European Parliament's attempt to do so is part of a delaying tactic to try and deny European consumers a single market. However, we are happy to go along with a collaborative research project in which the UK has an input. Until a new system has been agreed, the present system must be maintained so that there is no harmful effect on the UK. In any case, the whole thing—including the need for a new test—may be overturned in due course,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
which would make it clear that the European Parliament had been wasting public money in delaying and in commissioning the research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister outline the problems facing companies that export chocolate and clarify whether the directive would have any impact, inside and outside the Community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, there is a problem with our selling what is to us a normal product of milk chocolate—we have all seen the adverts about a pint and a half of milk in every one-pound bar of a particular brand. That is a high-value, high-quality product; it is not junk chocolate. However, we are not able to sell it as milk chocolate throughout the Community and we resent that. That has been the case since Britain has been a member of the European Community. We use non-cocoa vegetable fats—natural ingredients that are derived from speciality nuts, as detailed in the other brief before the Committee—but that enables different products to be made. Products such as Aero and Flake use non-cocoa vegetable fats, but that means that they cannot be imported into some countries—including some of the major players in the Community—where use of those fats is outlawed. That goes against the idea of a free market in products that are made from natural ingredients in different countries using different methods. We want to embrace all the different ways of making chocolate throughout Europe, and allow everyone a fair choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes an important point about the diversity of products in Europe and the entitlement of each product to fair and free access to all markets. He said that the European Parliament is putting up obstacles to free trade for UK products. Are there any other obstacles to that free trade?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is no. We can agree with the proposed Commission directive, which would create conditions for a single market in Europe that would meet the demands and expectations of British manufacturers. It would probably improve job prospects in this country, as we are currently denied the opportunity to export our quality products. Some 64,000 people are involved in the United Kingdom chocolate industry, including confectionary and biscuit-making. We make quality products from natural ingredients, but we are prevented from exporting them to our Community partners. The new directive would allow us to do that, which would enhance job prospects for people in this country. There is nothing wrong in that; it gives a wider choice in chocolate products to European consumers who are currently denied that opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I have no financial interest to declare, I should, as someone who is not a member of the Committee, tell the Committee why I am here. One tenth of United Kingdom confectionary workers are employed in my constituency, so I have a strong constituency interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Although the current directive is not perfect in that it does not give the same dispensation to the three new member states—the Scandinavians and the Austrians—as the British, the Danish and the Irish enjoy, it enables us to manufacture British chocolate according to the traditional British recipe. Will the Minister assure me that in the Council of Ministers, rather than fudging a compromise with the European Parliament's proposal, the Government will say that unless the British recipe—which, as the Minister said, is used in six other European member states—is protected, we will fall back on the existing directive? It is the Parliament, not the Commission or the Council, that needs to think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. There is no substantial problem with the Commission—we can accept the directive, with a couple of caveats about labelling. He mentions the three countries that recently acceded. They do not have the derogation because they failed to negotiate it. The United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark have it because it was negotiated when we acceded to the then European Community. The previous Conservative Government are to be applauded for obtaining that important protection for our industry, although it did not allow our industry to enjoy the benefits of the single market that came about after the 1986 legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stumbling block is the European Parliament, which is why we went out of our way to ensure that Members of the European Parliament of all opinions were on board as far as the British position is concerned. The issue is not third world and low-income countries; the stumbling block appears to be the determination of Members of the European Parliament to avoid a single market in Europe. There is evidence that some countries currently prevented from using non-cocoa vegetable fats would like to do so, although they have not yet emerged from the woodwork.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the Commission is taking a robust line and we expect in a few days' time to receive its comments on the European Parliament's proposals, which we hope will overturn virtually all of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the Minister's comments about the European Parliament, which appears to be at the centre of this debate, will he share his views on whether the opposition to his line—the proposal emerging from the European Parliament—is being argued by national or political groupings? Is this a cross-national proposal; is it being proposed by one political group; are MEPs representing several countries pushing for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without going into detail, because I am not familiar with the minutiae, my understanding that is that the matter is both cross-national and cross-political. It is not a question of country blocs; it is not wholly a question of political blocs—it is a matter of public record that the Socialist group took a line, but it was not wholly maintained because the majority of British MEPs supported the Government's view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The issue cuts across political and national groups. We do not know whether it is a matter of some countries or manufacturers trying to protect their position by preventing a single market, because of the export potential of this country, Denmark and Ireland, or whether there are other groups involved with another political agenda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have information about market share taken in recent years by manufacturers in different EU countries? Some major UK manufacturers have suggested to me that the attempt to use prejudicial labelling against the UK recipe is a market response on the part of manufacturers in those continental countries that use the wholly cocoa butter recipe to demean a British product that is highly successful and taking increased market share in Europe, whereas sales of the traditional French and German recipe product are practically static.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have at hand the market share figures for which my hon. Friend asks me, but I think that the underlying thrust of his suggestion is probably correct. We know that there was recently a problem in one EU country—whose name escapes me for the moment—that does not allow the use of vegetable fats, to which some of our products had been exported. That was clearly a question of market competitiveness among manufacturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not accept that our recipe is of lesser quality; there happen to be different traditions of chocolate making in Europe. As I said, those traditions have existed for decades; that of the high-milk content of dairy milk chocolate in this country has existed for more than 90 years or more, and no one can argue that that is not a quality product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Underlying issues of competition are at stake, and we must cut through them. The idea of a single market is to disrupt barriers to trade; it is absurd that one of the last great areas to join the single market in Europe is chocolate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was fascinated by the Minister's comment that he had circulated the document to all MEPs—I assume that he meant all MEPs, not just British ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just British ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall not make the comment that I was about to make; I misunderstood the Minister. He rightly referred to this as a single-market issue and to the need to remove barriers to trade. Therefore, I want to ask him about the milk chocolate issue in terms of the two different types of milk chocolate, which it is proposed should continue to exist under the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that he is basically happy with the draft directive—the Government support it. However, the draft directive continues to represent, to some extent, a remaining block to intra-Community trade, given that the same labelling cannot be used and
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
that our milk chocolate will have to be called "couverture", I believe, if it is exported to those other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government simply accept that two-form approach to milk chocolate, or will the Minister try to remove that distinction to produce a single definition of milk chocolate, which must, of course, include the British version of milk chocolate? The latter seems a much better way to open up the single market. What is the Minister's approach, and has he discussed it with his fellow Ministers abroad?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been discussed. It is true that there is an issue about milk chocolate. From my simplistic layman's point of view, somehow our competitors, our partners, our friends in Europe have used derogatory language about our recipe for high-value, high-milk-content chocolate. Because of the lack of a single market, our producers have been let off the leash, which has allowed them to undertake a full marketing operation within the Community. They are successful, leading-edge proponents of their products. I have every confidence that they could put the case for high-value, high-milk-content chocolate in a way that is good for competition, their product and jobs in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Commission proposals, all chocolate, with or without vegetable fat, should be allowed to circulate throughout the Community, labelled as chocolate. The proposals would permit United Kingdom and Irish milk chocolate to be made to a different recipe. However, our being allowed to use our recipe allows other countries to use their different recipes. The idea that there is one recipe for making chocolate and that is all that can be called chocolate is nonsense, and we do not accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want derogatory labelling to be put on our product. We want the ingredients to be made clear, which is important. There is nothing derogatory in the term "milk chocolate with a high milk content." We do not want that to be turned into derogatory labelling. I referred previously to Italy. The use of the term "household milk chocolate" is derogatory labelling, and we will not accept any system that allows it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not defensive about our way of producing milk chocolate. It is no good saying that this is not a problem until the European Parliament's amendments are out of the way. If we fail to achieve our aim, we might have to go through conciliation during our presidency and afterwards, so it might be the other end of the year before a decision is taken, which will slow progress considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot say what other countries might or might not do. The majority of countries in Europe appear to want to have a single market. However, as in many parts of the common agricultural policy, it is not easy to achieve change. Even if there is a climate for change, it is not easy to achieve the necessary votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only stumbling block to progress is the European Parliament's amendments. When the Commission responds and we can, hopefully, have them overturned, we shall be in a much better position to know the way forward. We can then negotiate any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
compromises that need to be made, but we will not support anything that will be detrimental to the British chocolate industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are keen to see inward investment to the United Kingdom. My constituency has seen inward investment of tens of millions of pounds in chocolate in the past five years from the two main manufacturers in my constituency, both of which are now foreign-owned multinationals—Rowntree owned by Nestle and Terry's of York owned by Kraft Jacob Suchard, which is owned ultimately by Philip Morris. The management and the work force in both factories have made it clear that the real competition these days is not other manufacturers but other Nestle and Suchard plants. Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that the ability to produce products that are saleable throughout the Community is extremely important for maintaining the bulk and stature of the industry and retaining employment and investment in the UK?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is yes. We have nothing to fear from the single market. My hon. Friend is right. There are some small producers of chocolate but large multinational companies are also involved in the industry and competition between brands and plants keeps management on its toes. The lack of a single market means that there is a clear barrier to trade and competition, which works against British interests, regardless of the ultimate owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the point that I made a few moments ago. I must make it clear that, first the Conservative party entirely supports the Government's attempt to ensure that British dairy milk products continue to be made and sold wherever possible and, secondly, we do not want labelling that could be described as derogatory. However, I must press the Minister on the issue of the two different forms of milk chocolate proposed in the annex to the directive and ask whether he thinks that that is still a market constraint. I understand it to mean that if the British form is exported outside Britain—or perhaps Britain and Ireland—the label must have a qualification written on it. Whether it is derogatory or not, it means a qualifying label. Would not it be better to push for the annex to be amended so that there is an embracing definition using maxima and minima of the various contents? At present, it seems to operate on one or the other. British and Irish milk chocolate would then be covered by the definition "milk chocolate", as would the other versions that use less milk. It would be a simpler way to open up the marketplace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. We have no problem with the definition of milk chocolate. At the risk of repeating myself, I can tell the Committee that milk solids cost more than cocoa solids. Milk chocolate is a higher value product. We understand that in this country; it is not a cheap and nasty product. We want to allow the manufacturers themselves, in conforming with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
directive, to decide how to present their chocolate, and where on the label to list the ingredients. If the ingredients constitute a great quantity of milk solids and vegetable fats, that can be listed on the label. Our preference would be to label the product "milk chocolate" and circulate it in the Community as such. The directive is a major step forward from the 1973 version in terms of what it will enable British manufacturers to do. It is like everything else in this world: we cannot get everything that we want. We want to liberalise the regime, otherwise we would continue with the status quo, but we do not want derogatory labelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new directive presents an opportunity that has not arisen for more than 20 years. If we lose this opportunity to create a single market in chocolate, how long will it be before another arises? By and large, the industry can live with the directive, but the major stumbling block is the European Parliament's amendments. Without their removal, no progress can be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is aware, under the latest rules in the general agreement on tariffs and trade, export refunds for chocolate materials must be removed or ended. What impact will that have on the chocolate-manufacturing industry throughout the European Union, especially in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question to which I do not know the answer. If I do before the end of the sitting, I shall let the hon. Gentleman know. If not, I shall write to him about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the Minister's comments about negotiations with the rest of Europe and the difficulty of not always getting everything that we want. I cannot help but reflect that, when going through the same experience, many Conservative Members were roundly criticised by the Minister and his colleagues when they were in opposition for failing to achieve all that they wanted. It is interesting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But accurate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very accurate. The boot is now on the other foot, which is somewhat satisfying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to take the matter forward more seriously. The Minister referred to the presidency. During the run up to that or in another forum, what discussions on the directive did he or other Ministers have with Ministers of the specific countries that we fear could form a blocking minority? Obviously, I am thinking of Belgium, France, Spain and the Netherlands. They are crucial countries, not just in relation to the Council of Ministers, but in influencing their MEPs when the matter inevitably goes back in some form to the European Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had no discussions, although others in the Department have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Except for the couple of caveats to which I referred earlier, we can live with the Commission's proposals. They stand a fair chance of being accepted by member states. The stumbling block is the European Parliament, which must have a say in this change,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
although that does not apply in many other matters. The issue has not arisen because of disputes among those in the Council of Ministers, because we can live with the compromise under the new directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said to the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson), the votes in the European Parliament were cross-national and cross-political. There was no central stumbling block. It would be unfair and untrue for me to say that the problem is due to the Belgians or the Germans. That is not the problem, given the cross currents in the European Parliament. If its amendments are not rejected or overturned, a different process will take place and that will require discussion. At present, it is not a national issue because the European Parliament was cross-voting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can now answer the question about GATT. It is impossible at present to predict the impacts of the changes to export refund rules. We are trying to ensure a level playing field, where there is the same impact on all producers. If the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk wants more information, I shall be happy to write to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Best</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that "a rose is a rose" by "any other name" and that that applies comfortably to British milk chocolate? My first encounter with non-British chocolate was with Belgian chocolate, which my father brought back immediately after the war. I thought that it was rather nice, but I preferred the taste with which I was familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have found—other hon. Members may share this experience—that European visitors always want to take back British chocolates to their homeland as presents; British chocolate biscuits are especially popular. I believe that we should be careful about labelling. A rose may be a rose by any other name, but I wonder how Irish coffe, for example, would fit in with European legislation on labelling. There is a powerful case for specifying contents on labels, but how we describe a product might be a matter of serious contention. I am half Irish, but I have not yet, to the best of my knowledge, come across coffee beans that are grown anywhere in Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This kind of foolishness gives the European Community not a bad name, but a silly name. Does the Minister agree that one of the joys of being in the European Community is the variation and the ability to enjoy differences? We should insist on protecting what is British and there is a considerable case for defending the labelling of the chocolate that we enjoy in Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I want to do is defend what is European—I never thought that I would say that—which includes the enormous variety in the methods of chocolate manufacture. That is the beauty of the industry in the European Community. We want to preserve the common European heritage of different ways of making chocolate. We want citizens of different member states to be able to enjoy other varieties of chocolate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The avantage of our method of chocolate production—using up to 5 per cent. vegetable fat—is that we can manufacture products that cannot be made without vegetable fats. Moreover, those products last longer and are more acceptable in some of our many export markets because they do not melt at such a low temperature as other chocolate products. I cannot comment on Irish coffee beans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would happily be forcibly fed Irish coffee, but may I change the subject slightly? I am sure that the Minister will accept that, whatever happens to the directive, it will obviously have an impact on the industry. It will almost certainly mean that some changes will have to be made; we do not know whether they will be minor or major, as we cannot foresee the outcome of the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Minister's views on Cocoa Research (UK) Ltd., the research and development body for the cocoa-chocolate industry? The huge tax changes being introduced by the Dept of Trade and Industry will mean that the money that is available to that body for research will be reduced to less than£50,000 a year, which will not go far, even in stable conditions, and certainly not if the directive causes huge changes. What steps have the Minister and his Department taken to persuade the DTI that the tax-exemption status currently enjoyed by Cocoa Research (UK) Ltd. should continue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I can say is that the question of tax exemption for all British research institutes is the subject of discussions between Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely agree with my hon. Friend the Minister's comments on the importance of diversity in consumer choice. One should be against neither the continental nor the British recipe. One should allow consumers to buy what they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my hon. Friend the Minister aware that the chairman of the European Parliament consumer affairs committee, the Labour MEP Phillip Whitehead, organised a blind tasting of British and continental chocolate products at the end of one of his committee meetings? Committee members could not tell the difference—I should say that they could not tell which product was which; they could obviously tell the difference—because a majority favoured what turned out to be the UK product. If such false and malign arguments about quality crop up at the Council of Ministers, my hon. Friend should remind his fellow Ministers what happened at that committee meeting and warn them that they too risked embarrassment if they had a blind tasting and were unable to decide which product was which.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be visiting a large chocolate manufacturer on Friday and meeting representatives of the chocolate industry there. While my hon. Friend was speaking, I was thinking that, although I am not responsible for planning the menus for all the meetings that will take place during our presidency, I have no doubt that we shall force-feed Ministers with the gastronomic delights of the British diet. The British
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
way of doing things will of course include after-dinner mints. We may have some real blind tasting after some of those dinners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is questionable whether there will be any sense of taste left at that stage in the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drinking chocolate is mentioned in the directive. It is proposed that drinking chocolate should stay under the heading of chocolate. However, some countries believe that, because of its slightly different composition, it should be listed in section 1 under the heading, "cocoa and cocoa powders". What is the Government's view about that designation of drinking chocolate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent question. I know nothing about the tradition of drinking chocolate in other European countries, but I know that it is a tradition here. We want to maintain the existing designation of drinking chocolate. It is part of our tradition and we shall certainly not support a change that could alter it. There may or may not be drinking chocolate in other European states—apart from Ireland and Denmark—but it is certainly part of our tradition, and we intend to keep it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My final question is about the world trade in chocolate. The directive deals not only with the single market, but seeks to open more opportunities throughout the world. I am concerned that in some parts of the world British chocolate is banned—I think particularly of Saudi Arabia—because of the absurd prospect that the milk could somehow be linked to BSE or to other related health matters. Will the Minister take this opportunity to tell the Committee how much importance the Government attach to those export markets? What steps are the Government taking to persuade those Governments who have banned the import of British milk chocolate that the basis for doing so is wholly fallacious and lacks any scientific evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that. I freely admit that before I entered the Ministry I was unaware of the dairy ban imposed by some countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, based on those spurious reasons. We have spelt out to the Saudis in as clear and friendly terms as possible that there is no scintilla of evidence—scientific or otherwise—of any BSE problem whatever with milk in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a high-quality herd and a high-quality product, and we take extensive steps to protect the quality of our milk. The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee has considered the matter in producing its advice on BSE; it has always given milk an absolutely clean bill of health. There are no rumours; our milk is absolutely clean—pasteurised milk, that is; real milk, or "dirty milk", as some call it, is a separate issue on which we are consulting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spelt out those facts to the Saudis during ministerial visits in this country and in Saudi Arabia and through diplomatic channels. The ban is a major problem; the hon. Gentleman is right to raise it; it prevents the export of quality British products to what
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
is a friendly country, to which we export many other products. We want to get the issue settled as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If no other hon. Members wish to ask questions, we shall now proceed to the debate on the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 8164/96, relating to cocoa and chocolate products intended for human consumption; and endorses the Government's efforts to resist any discrimination against UK products, to secure their free circulation throughout the EC and to maintain the widest possible range of consumer choice.—[	<i>Mr. Rooker.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.22 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Paice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be quite as brief as the Minister, but he may well want to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drafting of the directive began during the previous Government's time in office; indeed some of the explanatory memorandums were signed by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) when she held the office of Parliamentary Secretary. We recognise the need to move forward from the rather unsatisfactory present situation, although we have for a long time held the exemptions that we needed for our chocolate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly concerned by some of the compromises that appear to be in prospect on the issue of labelling. Obviously, I welcome the Minister's objection to double labelling; it is clearly sensible to remove that proposal. As the progenitor of the single market, the objective of the British Government should be to work towards a single definition and single labels for different forms of chocolate. It would be a barrier to trade that we should resist if British milk chocolate had to be called something else or given a qualifying term, whatever that might be, for export outside Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is huge scope for further expansion of the chocolate market—for both milk chocolate and the other forms of chocolate from other European countries. The countries that are taking a different attitude from us have perhaps not taken on board the fact that any expansion of the world trade in chocolate and cocoa products is good for the primary producers of cocoa beans, and for other African states who are producers of vegetable beans. Whether or not chocolate contains 5 per cent. vegetable fat, any expansion of the market will still require more chocolate, which must be beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's comments about the need to promote consumer choice; I know that he would agree that informed choice is required. As he says, labelling needs to be perfectly readable, but we should not place too onerous a burden on producers by making them produce different labelling for many different market places. I congratulate the Commission on the 5 per cent. vegetable fat proposal, although I am slightly reserved about the subsidiarity issue because it carries risks of market interference. However, in principle the proposal is a clear step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
On the Minister's response to my question about the meetings and discussions he may have had with foreign Ministers, I accept his word that the European Members of Parliament who voted for the amendments were cross-party and cross-national, but there is no doubt—I am sure that the Minister will agree—that the focus of opposition to some of the amendments is from several countries that object to the use of any vegetable fat and to too much milk in chocolate. I was concerned that the Minister seemed to suggest that, because we support the Commission, that is sufficient. During the six months of the British presidency, it is the Government's responsibility to try to broker an agreement with those countries. I therefore hope that the Minister will make the effort to speak to Ministers from the countries that are in the van of opposition to some aspects to persuade them that their fears are ill-founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made it clear that we should press for a single definition of milk chocolate, taking a maxima or a minima approach so that we did not have the two different approaches in regard to the qualifying term, whether or not it is derogatory—although obviously it is unacceptable that it should be derogatory—by changing the documentation that covers those two issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) about the next world trade talks and the pressure to cut export refunds. I hope that the Minister will honour his undertaking to respond to my hon. Friend on the Government's policies on those issues; perhaps he would send a copy to me. The Minister will know that the export of chocolate and confectionary, and of many other food products outside the EU, is viable only if the extra costs incurred by buying CAP-supported European commodities are refunded at the point of export to enable them to compete with non-EU products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition support the Government's general approach, which is generally the line that we took when we were in office. However, the Government need to be more pro-active in making sure that they take the lead in brokering an agreement among the countries that are less happy than we about the Commission's draft directive. The sooner we get the directive cleared, the better. From my experience, I accept that those things take time but the Government have a vital role, particularly given our presidency, in taking a strong lead in getting that resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.27 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the Minister's robust statement about the Government's decision to stick up for the British product and Britain's ability to market its products throughout the European Union. I also welcome the Opposition's support for that approach. I wish to keep alive that sense of common purpose, but I also wish to point out that Labour Members have an obligation to carry on talking to socialist members of the European
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Parliament who have not supported our position. Equally, Conservative Members have an obligation to talk to European People's party members who voted against the interests of diversity and the British product. I note in passing that the Conservative party made no input in the European People's party group meeting that discussed its position before the debate in the European Parliament. I do not know the reason for that, but we must all continue to try to change attitudes, which would be good for our product and good for European parliamentarians. I stress that because the anti-UK, Irish, Scandinavian, Austrian, Portuguese position that was taken in the European Parliament was by a very narrow majority and could be overturned if we could get a few of our colleagues in the different political groups to see sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the arguments deployed by the continental countries which favour the cocoa butter-only recipe, which has had some influence in the European Parliament, is the false argument that banning the use of vegetable oils other than cocoa butter, which is, of course, itself a vegetable oil, will improve prospects for third world farmers' cocoa. The consumption of cocoa in the European Union has doubled in the past 15 or 16 years. In 1980 the EU imported 542,000 tonnes and by 1994, the same EU states imported 1.1 billion tonnes. The EU cocoa market has therefore increased substantially and the vast majority of that increase has not been the consumption of chocolate blocks but chocolate-filled products. They are called "count lines" in the trade—I must be careful to select products manufactured by a number of companies—such as Aero bars, KitKats and Mars bars.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lynne Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Selly Oak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Flake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say Cadbury's Flake, but it is not a chocolate-filled product. My hon. Friend the Minister made an important point about Flake and Aero, which is made in York. Such products could not be manufactured if the continental recipe were imposed on the UK because the chocolate used is much more brittle than a cocoa butter-only product. The Flake would not be flaky and the Aero would not retain its bubbles. People must have variety and choice, so we must retain our recipes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Resistance is coming from European manufacturers because the UK-style snack products are selling more and more strongly throughout Europe and they are frightened of losing their market share. There is a simple answer to the continental chocolate manufacturers. They can carry on making their high-quality Belgian chocolates but they can also start making count line products. There will then be more variety for the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that cocoa farmers would gain from disallowing cocoa butter substitutes is wrong because it is the very manufacturers who use substitutes who are increasing the demand for cocoa and providing opportunities for cocoa farmers. There is another factor, which I hope my hon. Friend will take into account and argue at the Council if the third world dimension becomes an issue. The cocoa butter equivalent vegetable oils and the cocoa butter
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
improver vegetable oils, which are used in products such as Flake and Aero, come from poor developing countries. The principal component of those alternative or additional tropical vegetable oils is shea oil which comes from a nut. The vast bulk of shea oil production in the world comes from two of the poorest countries in Africa—Burkina Faso and Mali. The people involved in that production would be left destitute if there were no market for incorporating small quantities of those oils in chocolate products in the many European Union countries that traditionally have used them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want to help the poorest of the poor in developing countries, we should be especially concerned about shea oil. In some cases, cocoa is farmed by small farmers, especially in west Africa, but it is also farmed on huge plantations in Malaysia, Brazil, and Cote d'Ivoire. However, shea oil is not produced on farms; it is a wild product which is collected usually by women who are too poor to own, or farm, land in Burkina Faso and Mali. They are living absolutely on the margins of poverty. If the market for their product were to disappear, there would be serious development consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point must be made in the Council if the false argument that the proposal is good for third-world cocoa producers becomes an issue, which, I suspect, it will not. Although that argument was deployed in the European Parliament, its basis is, in fact, poor because of the growth in consumption of cocoa and, therefore, the increased market available to cocoa producers. Ministers may be slightly better informed than some European parliamentarians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel a bit of a fraud speaking here. Someone from one of the local newspapers in my constituency phoned me to find out my new year's resolution. I said that it was to try to temper my voracious appetite for chocolate. However, I could not attend the Committee without saying a few words in defence of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important points, which the Minister accepts, that emerged during questions to the Minister, is the need to recognise diversity in pursuing European legislation. When we try to secure a single market for a product, we do not mean a single market for a particular aspect of that product or one definition of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, diversity must be tempered with an assessment of quality. The Minister was right to argue that we all have different definitions of quality, some of which will be moderated by scientific advice among other matters. However, the industry in this country is entitled to be treated fairly in the consideration of the quality of its product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I encourage the Minister to argue as strongly and as positively as he can to enable producers to take responsibility for designing, labelling and promoting the products that they are trying to sell. Our industry
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
has nothing to fear; it can create a positive and assertive marketing strategy to secure the sale of its product. We must leave the responsibility for determining the best way to do that in the hands of producers.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The documents were sent to us rather early, so I read them in part during the recess, when there was more time to do so. I thought, "My God, what have we here?" When one relaxes slightly during the recess, it is possible to think of all sorts of examples of British milk chocolate not being chocolate. I wondered whether a Robin Reliant was an automobile, or whether it should be called something else. If there is to be qualifying terminology, perhaps the term "new chocolate" should be used. Such a term worked elsewhere, so why not here?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's position, as always, is totally clear. We either retain the current position, about which I shall say more later, or we maintain the status quo plus additional aspects, such as a free single market in milk chocolate. I believe that we should go a little further than merely retaining the status quo, as the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) said. I am pro-European and I back the European Parliament, which is a wonderful institution, but I would fight it on this issue. I do not know what happened when the Members discussed it—perhaps they had been on a visit to a brewery—but I cannot for the life of me understand how they arrived at such a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are discussing remains a bit of a mystery to me. There must be a legislative framework backing up the Single European Act 1985, through which we can say that what has been decided is totally contrary to the direction and thought behind the Act. If so, it should not be too difficult to overturn the ideas of the European Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious issue. As my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Mr. Bayley) said, there are employment implications in the United Kingdom—he mentioned the 64,000 people who work in the industry. He also mentioned the ownership of chocolate firms, saying that they were international and multi-national. I thought, "Hang about, I do not know whether we are talking only about employment, or about ownership and profit." Capital flows freely in the European Union, so if British milk chocolate had a dominant position, the rest of the world would product it—it would be made even in Belgium, although it would probably be called something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to make up my mind whether moving from the present position would be good for Britain. If British chocolate becomes dominant and consumers like it better than totally cocoa-produced chocolate, it will be made elsewhere, which will create new competition. We cannot resist international technical transfers; British chocolate can be produced anywhere in the world.

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for City of York also mentioned cocoa-exporting countries, some of which are poor. That is bad, and perhaps aid should be given, but we should not keep eating the same chocolate just because countries that export cocoa are poor. My hon. Friend said that if we did not eat the chocolate that we are used to, but ate new types of chocolate, people in those countries would not have work. I do not agree. We should give aid in different ways and finance agricultural diversification. Those countries should have no say in the kind of chocolate we produce and eat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that agricultural diversification is an important form of aid but, rather than worrying about other forms of aid or whether those countries are, as the hon. Gentleman seemed to imply, dictating how we trade, we should ensure that we remove the barriers to trade that will still exist after the directive is approved, so that the world market for chocolate and cocoa products is expanded. Even is 5 per cent. of a product is vegetable oil, if total chocolate production is expanding, the demand for cocoa butter and other cocoa products will increase. There is no need for countries to dictate terms or for the extra aid that the hon. Gentleman mentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. In 1980, the European Union used 542,000 tonnes of cocoa beans; 14 years later, that figure had more than doubled. Cocoa-exporting countries would not object if what the hon. Gentleman suggests were carried out not just in the European Union but across the world economy so that free trade were enhanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Government's position. If a proposal in that respect was blocked by the European Parliament, we should fight it. We should not lie down and accept one or two amendments that we, as a nation, do not like. We should go all the way to reject them; we might even have to go to court and put our argument in the context of free trade, the single market in the European Union and the world economy as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because many of my arguments have already been advanced by members of the Committee. Given some of the debates, that we have had in this Committee during the past few months, we have reached an unnatural consensus in some respects. I should declare an interest, not because I am a chocoholic like the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney), but because I am a new member of the Catering Committee and I suspect that I shall have to taste a variety of chocolate products that will be offered to hon. Members and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's robust view of the document. I accept that it is not a matter of the United Kingdom versus the rest of Europe. When declaring his constituency interest, the hon. Member for City of
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
York advanced the valid argument that we are talking about not only British-owned manufacturing companies, but multi-national companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is about market forces and consumer choice. There is a certain irony about consumer choice. British people now travel frequently to the continent with much greater ease. One of the first things that they do when they visit Belgium is buy Belgian chocolate and vice versa. We are discussing a variety of choice and a variety of taste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, as much as anything else we are talking about a taste and a choice throughout different countries that goes back at least 100 years. However a product is packaged and labelled, if the public likes it, have been used to consuming it and there is no risk to health, why should they not be allowed to make a particular choice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. It is important to ensure that we do not have restrictive labelling on products. It could put United Kingdom chocolate manufacturers at a disadvantage. We are in danger of reaching a situation when labelling will become such an important part of the packaging that the packaging will become larger to accommodate the names of the different aspects of the product to inform the consumer. We must bear in mind that the consumer has a lot of common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my next comment will not be regarded by the Committee as a red herring, but I want to refer to another popular product that may defy definition. A wide variety of ice cream products is available in this country and throughout Europe. Some of the most popular ice cream that comes from a machine could be accused of defying the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 on the grounds that it contains virtually no cream, but many other ingredients. However, that ice cream is exceptionally popular and most people would be aghast if it were re-labelled as something other than ice cream. For example, "ice non-cream product" would sound strange. We are talking about consumer choice and consumer sense. As long as there is no risk to health, the matter should be put on one side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are at the beginning of the UK presidency of the European Union and I know that the Prime Minister is keen to support British products and British designers, regardless of whether they contribute to Labour party funds. I urge the Minister to stress on every possible occasion the need for a full range of chocolate products, including British dairy products, so that Ministers from other countries can indulge their tastes. During our presidency, we should be saying that we support the single market and want to have a wide range of consumer choice in which British chocolate products are not placed at a disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.49 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting morning. It was nearly an hour before Conservative Members started making silly party-political points. By and large, members of the Committee have operated as good chocolate soldiers on behalf of the industry. I

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
accept the points made by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk about using the presidency, but that does not mean that we can rule the roost and order our partners around—far from it. The presidency comes only once every few years, so we must treat it carefully. However, we shall attempt to use all our good offices to seek change that will benefit everyone and solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for City of York made all the points that I would have made about the matter not being a third world issue. As my hon. Friend said, consumption has doubled in the past decade and a half, which benefits farmer-producers. Non-cocoa vegetable fats also come from very poor countries, so that is not a valid argument. The Commission has looked at the matter and sees no disbenefit to the poorer countries in the long term. The argument that cocoa producers will be adversely affected by the directive comes from a campaign funded by multinational cocoa manufacturers based in Rotterdam. Most of the cocoa coming into the European Union is pressed there, and the multinational companies control most of the supply of
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
cocoa butter. They have a vested interest and their argument about cocoa producers does not stand up. The Commission does not see that as a problem and nor do we.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend making a long speech as most of the points have been covered. A couple of issues that have not been raised previously were mentioned and I hope that I have dealt with them sufficiently. I shall review the position at the end of the debate and if there are any matters that need further clarification, I shall write to hon. Members. We shall come back to the matter in the Scrutiny Committee when the Commission gives its full response, which we expect in a matter of days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
