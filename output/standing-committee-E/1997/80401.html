	<p>[	<i>Relevant document: European Community Document No. 7831/97, a Commission Communication, An overall view of Energy Policy and Actions.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind Members of the Committee that we now have an hour of questions to the Minister, followed by a maximum of one and a half hours of debate. Hon. Members who are not members of the Committee may take part, but they may not vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Science, Energy and Industry (Mr. John Battle)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Energy Council will meet under the United Kingdom presidency on 11 May. Our themes for the presidency are jobs, the environment and building a single market. Those three key themes come together in the papers before the Committee, which consider renewable energy and its contribution to the future. The papers consider the potential for jobs, the contribution to tackling environmental challenges and the building of a single market in energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council of Ministers will hold an open debate on 11 May on energy and the environment, allowing a discussion of the environmental impact of energy supply and use. The debate will also permit a consideration of the contribution that the energy sector could make to the Kyoto agreement, signed by members of the European Union. Greater use of renewable energy will form part of any strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector, as will energy efficiency and other measures, including those relating to transport and new forms of vehicle fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's White Paper provides some useful ideas on how Europe can increase its use of renewables and I expect the Council to adopt the motion before us as the proposed resolution setting out its response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also hope that at the Council we shall be able to make significant progress on the energy framework programme—the second of the documents before the Committee. The programme is multiannual and, for the first time, will bring together a number of the Commission's activities in the energy sector. It will streamline management and avoid the duplications and overlaps that currently exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The energy framework programme has been developed in response to calls from all the member states to provide a more coherent and transparent
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
management structure. The framework is new, but most of what it contains is not. It brings together existing activities: the SYNERGY programme, which relates to third countries, joining up policies in countries throughout the European Union with those of countries outside the union; the SAVE programme, which relates to energy efficiency; and the ALTENER programme, which is the main element in creating the conditions in which to generate support for renewable energy. They will all come under a single heading. The only new element is the CARNOT programme, which will foster clean coal technologies—I stress the plural.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on European Legislation took a particular interest in the enabling decision that set up the framework programme. That decision is in annex I of the documents; the ALTENER, SAVE and CARNOT programmes are in annexes IV, V and VI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the enabling decision to the Committee. It will simplify and streamline activities carried out by DGXVII in the Commission. Those were previously separate programmes with separate budget headings; they will now be brought together, which has long been the wish of the Council, and indeed of the UK. That will enable their relative merits to be considered and will avoid duplication. The improved co-ordination, transparency and financial control will also maximise the complementarity of the actions and programmes. It will optimise the use of resources and ensure that they are not scattered by the use of contradictory policies. Officials have been negotiating on those matters and have made good progress. I hope that we can arrive at a decision at the May Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament has stated that it might need longer to complete its consideration of the documents. It may therefore be unrealistic to expect a final decision next month. However, if there is a decision, I may have to propose to hold a second Energy Council to ensure that those matters are tidied up, signed, sealed and delivered. All the programmes will then be pulled together. That is one of the most important matters that we shall debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important elements of the framework is ALTENER II—the groundwork, pilot studies and pilot actions that create those conditions. Last December, the Council reached a political agreement on a two-year programme with a financial reference of 22 million ecu over two years. We welcome the current proposal in annex IV to extend the ALTENER programme to the year 2002 because it is a good programme for encouraging renewables into which we want to continue to link.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SAVE programme will also fall within the framework programme. It seeks to stimulate energy efficiency measures across the whole range of energy users, through a variety of non-technical measures, including support for demonstration projects, energy agencies and research studies on a transnational basis. It is a modest but not insignificant programme in which the United Kingdom has actively participated; the work that we are already doing complements and works with it and we welcome its incorporation in the framework programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
The new programme, CARNOT, seeks to promote the use of European solid fuel technologies, especially clean coal technologies—I stress "technologies" in the plural. There are a range of technologies: conventional pulverised fuel, advanced pulverised, the so-called super-critical, pressurised fluidised bed combustion systems, integrated gasification and the hybrids that blend combustion with gasification. They are not all at the same level of development. Some are already in commercial use and others are at the research stage. We need an enhanced programme but we must also be aware that there is a plurality of approaches on which we must focus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not go into further details but will simply say that the aim of the CARNOT programme is to disseminate best practice and knowledge about the best available technologies throughout the European Union. It proposes measures to create an information network and to foster industrial strategic co-operation to take those technologies through to production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper was adopted by the Commission at the end of last year following the earlier Green Paper that was discussed by the previous Administration. It proposes a Community target of 12 per cent gross inland energy consumption to come from renewables by 2010. That is an ambitious target to make greater use of renewable energy, both in the EU as a whole and in the UK. It is vital to have ambitious targets if we are to meet our environmental commitments and also benefit from the world markets in new and renewable technologies. There is a world to be won out there in a worldwide movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's proposals would require an investment of more than £100 billion over the next decade, spread over 15 member states. Mobilising that scale of investment, most of which will have to come from the private sector, is a major challenge that has not been bottomed out and fully addressed in the documentation. We must build that in properly if it is to be a realistic target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that to meet the challenge it is vital for all member states to prepare positive, practical and workable plans suited to their own circumstances, and that that should be done before precise targets are set. We are already reviewing our policy and examining what needs to be done if we are to achieve the aim of supplying 10 per cent. of UK electricity from renewable sources by 2010. A practical work programme is being drawn up to see how to achieve those targets and I hope to announce the conclusions soon to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, only 2 per cent. of our electricity comes from renewables so we have some way to go. Our targets in the non-fossil fuel obligation project that we discussed in relation to the Fossil Fuel Levy Bill are realistic and achievable, but it will mean a four to fivefold increase in renewable energy in the UK. We will find a way to do that and it is interesting that other member states are asking us how the NFFO mechanism works, because they want to know whether it can be adopted in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says yes. Let me compliment the Opposition by saying that they set up the mechanism. We have discussed it before. It is a germ of an idea; let us carry it forward. It can be a practical proposal to show what can be done if we set our minds to promoting and developing renewables. The White Paper spells out that responsibility for promoting renewables rests principally with member states, not least because all member states are at different stages. Some have huge amounts of hydro power. Others such as France use forestry. There is a different history of the use of renewables according to climactic and agricultural circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to do better in Britain, and we are developing a work programme to achieve that. Although we cannot sign up to the details—because they do not yet exist—of the Commission's aspirations to 12 per cent., I hope that the White Paper can be used as a launch pad for a practical, positive programme for developing renewable energy in the European Union in the next decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will warmly welcome the proposals that we intend to present to the Council on 11 May. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members not to anticipate the debate that follows questions, and to keep their questions brief. There will be an opportunity for everyone to ask a question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Atkinson, may I first welcome you to the Chair and thank the Minister for his introductory statement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How firm is the Government's commitment to their target of ensuring that 10 per cent. of electricity is generated by renewables by 2010? How does that target relate to the Commission's less definite proposal for 12 per cent. of all energy use, which is a quarter of electricity consumption, by the same date? Do the Government believe, as the explanatory memorandum implies, that the latter target is not practical at present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How should I put it? As Britain holds the presidency of the Council, we want to encourage a positive response from all member states. Therefore, I do not want to undermine ambitious targets. But the method of achieving them must be spelt out more clearly. Each nation state must do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our target is 10 per cent. We initiated a review—the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) may jib at the word—to discover how to achieve the target. The review examined existing programmes to ascertain practical methods of increasing our use of renewable energy from 2 per cent. to 10 per cent. by 2010. That review is progressing well, and I have seen drafts of it. I shall present its results to the House for public discussion as soon as possible. I hope to do that well before we break for the summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial detail behind any package depends on the comprehensive spending review. With that proviso, we can work towards our targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
We should press other countries in Europe to do what we have done: spell out local implications and ascertain how to achieve targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful of the expression "gross inland energy consumption", which relates to the 12 per cent. target. "Gross energy consumption" includes not only energy generated into power stations, but vehicles and fuel, cars and petrol. Therefore, it includes a transport element. Our 10 per cent. target applies to electricity generation. Other measures tackle cleaning up and greening vehicles, for example, the link programme for cleaner vehicles. We should not lose sight of energy efficiency measures to reduce the amount of energy that we use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our package is more subtle. The gross inland energy consumption figure from the Commission disguises the transport element. We have focused on electricity generation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on an excellent opening statement. It must have been especially important because Liberal Democrat Members have graced us with their presence, for which we are grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us more about the SAVE programme? We have a lot of expertise, which the Minister mentioned, but how will the SAVE programme benefit United Kingdom expertise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the SAVE programme is to stimulate energy efficiency. It is not a substitute for energy efficiency programmes in Britain or elsewhere in the Union. Some states already have energy efficiency measures. In the United Kingdom, such policies are mainly the responsibility '''Of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The home energy efficiency scheme, which has already accounted for £75 million, covers insulation in the houses of the elderly and people with disabilities. We have other schemes to make houses more energy efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us give the Conservative party credit occasionally. It established the Energy Saving Trust in 1992, and backed it with resources. We have more than maintained that by providing £19 million for the scheme. We shall build on and enhance the achievements of the Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here in Britain there is also the energy efficiency best practice programme, providing a range of technical information to professionals and advisers in industry—to advise companies on how to buy and make better use of their energy. The SAVE programme will not only support the development of technological solutions, but address the barriers to the application of energy efficiency measures—to help take companies and domestic users through available options. It will not consider only under-used proven technologies but information, publicity measures, management initiatives and financial approaches on a transnational basis across the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Energy labelling is an example of what the SAVE programme deals with: we have made good use of it in the past and the SAVE II enhanced programme will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
welcome. It is well tailored to what we are doing and I hope that other member states will imitate our good example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a visitor to the Committee, Mr. Atkinson, may I first thank you for calling me. The Minister's approach seems to have given a negative impression in Europe. Would he comment on that and reiterate the very positive measures that he proposes to take? The message in the media seems to be that Britain is obstructing the creation of a Europe-wide percentage figure of 12 per cent. Will he respond to that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman to the Committee; I am glad that he is here to join in our debate. An article in one newspaper, which will remain nameless, certainly had a go. Why? In our original response to the memorandum, we had to consider how the scheme would apply in Britain. Were we prepared immediately to pick up the tab and sign up for it? No, not without it being thought through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are in fact doing more than most other European Union countries in relation to targets for renewable energy. We may not have as much hydro power as Sweden, wind power as Denmark or forestry use as France, but in terms of putting industrial waste and recycling into energy use, we are well ahead. When I looked at the table I was surprised at the number of sectors in which Britain was ahead—biomass being another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our programme is indeed positive, so I am not too worried about one negative article. I did enjoy, however, the headline in today's edition of 	<i>The Independent</i>: "Battle for green power", which appeared above my letter. I also enjoyed the headline in today's edition of 	<i>The Times</i>:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tidal power gets a fresh wave of pure enthusiasm"</p></blockquote>
about the Government's DTI smart award scheme. We are keen to promote all sources of renewable energy. I am sometimes excoriated in another publication—do we call it a newspaper?—	<i>Private Eye,</i> for being too green and too keen on renewable energies. I am keen to see them developed because they will provide the cleaner technologies and jobs of the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, however, do the arithmetic to get the sums right: if it is too pricey no one will be able to afford to buy renewable energy. We need to do two things: keep the lights on, and ensure that renewable energy is affordable by ordinary people. That will enable us to boost the potential for new technologies and world markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sometimes read as caution, but our approach is eminent common sense. My job as President of the Council of Ministers is to encourage all EC countries to have, not just an aspirational or notional target that is stuck out there but never achieved, but the nuts and bolts in position so that we get there by the year 2010.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we all support the increase in the use of renewables, I should like to ask the Minister to reassure the mining communities in and around my constituency in Nottinghamshire, and elsewhere, that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
the clean-coal technology idea that is being pursued through the CARNOT programme will be pursued rigorously. We expect the clean-coal technology to be in place so that the renewable targets that we all want will not be achieved by sacrificing pits and miners' jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am grateful to my hon. Friend who has campaigned assiduously for clean-coal technology since his arrival in the House—more power to his elbow for providing that voice. The CARNOT programme is the one new element in the framework. It will create an information network aimed at fostering industrial strategic co-operation and promoting the export of European technologies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To correct any impression that we are not achieving anything at present—we are. We are spending £4 million on research and development in the financial year that starts today. The Government have also initiated a £100,000 study by industry and the universities as part of the science foresight programme—to prepare a detailed action plan to discover what is required to foster clean-coal technology in the next 20 years. Industry estimates show that the British and international coal industries, for example those in China and south-east Asia, must consider clean coal in order to reduce greenhouse gases across the globe. The export industry could be worth about £50 billion to the United Kingdom over the next 10 years; the total international market is about £500 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research money has been spent by companies such as Global Energy, which is investigating building power plant in Scotland, and Celtic Energy, which proposes to build clean-coal technology plant in Wales. There is a range of technologies, which are not all at the same stages of development; some are at the primary research stage and some are already complete. We cannot simply say, "Stick with that one technology." Companies must be aware of the plural range of options, all of which can be exploited, whether the technologies involve combustion, pulverisation or a hybrid technology. We support the exploration of all of them but—this is a key point—what is needed is someone who will risk investment in technology to build power plant. I look to the energy generators to take a lead; they, not miners, will build clean-coal technology plant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I probe the Minister on the rationale for determining these matters at European Union level rather than by subsidiarity to the member states?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a target for the whole of the European Union but, as the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
greenhouse gases has been set for the European Union as a whole, which we hope that Britain alone will achieve without too much difficulty, even though it is an ambitious aim, because of measures that have been in train for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development of renewables in the European Union member states is uneven. Some technologies are in place; some countries have hydro because they have mountains and rivers. They have already achieved their targets and do not need to consider biomass, wind power, landfill gas and other sources. We want to keep the range of options open and not simply tell countries that have the historical and geographical legacy of hydro power that they need not make any more effort. The scope for the development of large-scale hydro power seems to be declining so other measures must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I call upon the European Union to do a bit of joined-up thinking: the need to consider how farms and land can be used for biomass is sometimes bedevilled by the policies of the common agricultural policy, and that needs to be sorted out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The current figure of 12 per cent. is aspirational, as the Minister said; the Commission is really saying that it hopes that that will be achieved. Does the Minister agree that it would be appropriate to firm up that figure during the next couple of years? The White Paper issued by the Commission last year said that working groups would be set up to analyse the goal and to establish what contributions each country should make to the different industries. After a year or 18 months of those working groups, I hope that it will be possible to make a specific prediction of what we hope to achieve, rather than to continue for five years with only an inspirational target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his positive and practical suggestion. The most difficult passages of the White Paper to get my head around were on pages 11 and 12 in paragraph 1.4—the preliminary assessment of some of the costs and benefits. I am always sceptical of analyses that suggest that thousands of jobs will result from a measure. I have too often heard development corporations and others claiming that an initiative will create, say, 5,000 jobs. In the present case, it is suggested that 500,000 to 1 million new jobs will result. I want to know where the numbers come from. I want to know, when I consider the costs and benefits of the programme, and the figure of £110 million over 10 years, what we will be getting from it. Are the jobs real? Will wind farms, biomass plant and wave power produce that result?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope for a more strategic approach to meeting targets, like that adopted for the single regeneration budget. It was decided to work out, with respect to money for localities and regions, where the jobs would be, and to take a detailed approach. Paragraph 1.4 of the White Paper led me to suspect that some of the figures were rather notional. I remember that the noble Lord Tordoff asked me in correspondence why I thought our programmes would be affected to the tune of £1 billion to £3 billion. That assessment is based on our present targets. We can do work, based on the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
information that we have, to sharpen the figures. If we do not do that in detail, we shall never approach our target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working group has met once, but only so that member states could report on national programmes. We know that those, if left as they are, will account for 8 per cent. of the relevant provision by 2010, leaving us only 4 per cent. down. We could sharpen matters up by intensifying our examination of national programmes. That is the purpose of our review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I direct the Minister's attention to paragraph 2.2.1 on page 15 of the White Paper, in particular the passage that states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where significant differences exist between Member States regarding the extent to which renewable energy is supported … this may result in significant trade distortions".</p></blockquote>
What analysis has the Minister's Department made of the trade distortions that could arise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to deal with trade distortions in the broader context. The notion of opening up a market in energy generation has been accepted in Britain, and we are pushing for a single market in gas and electricity in Europe, It could be claimed that the non-fossil fuel obligation support system interferes with the market. It is a supportive mechanism to enable renewable energies to break into the market. Those mechanisms do not exist in Europe as a whole. We are investigating how the market could be opened up in a way that did not prejudice the development of renewable energy sources. The process could squeeze them out altogether, through everyone buying and importing cheap gas, to put it crudely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, 50 per cent. of the United Kingdom's energy is imported. That is projected to rise' to 70 per cent. The good thing about renewables is that they will be indigenous energy sources. We therefore need to ensure that the single market that we set up does not create distortion that will squeeze out renewables. We shall have to examine the subtlety of the NFFO mechanism, which we discussed earlier. It should be supportive and enable renewable energies to enter the market, establish themselves on a competitive footing and, as fledglings, fly on their own. We must knit together different legal and support systems. It will not be easy. Some countries' energy generation is still nationalised—some hydro power, for example. That might lead the countries concerned to argue, "We have done renewables it is all in-house. What's the problem?" We must go beyond that mentality to build a framework and single market for the whole Union. That is part of our present task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question follows immediately on that answer. To what extent does my hon. Friend the Minister believe that, in the recent past especially, the promotion of renewable energy sources and provision has been undermined and weakened by over-reliance on short-term market considerations and the availability of cheap fossil fuels? If he believes those to have been strong factors in recent energy development, will he use his good offices to counter them, to ensure that we get the long-term energy provision pattern correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend who has always, in Committees when I have been present, insisted that we focus on the medium and longer term. That is most welcome but he must also get the Government focused on the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face difficulties with energy policy. The reason is the constant drive for cheaper energy. When I was very young, the emphasis was on nuclear power and power from the dynamics of the sun. The latter would, it was said, give energy for ever, and would be free never mind cheap. After that came the discovery of gas that was too cheap to meter. All along we have been driven by the notion of getting the price down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the inner-city area that I represent, fuel poverty is the problem. Fewer than half the homes there have central heating. I cannot accept the idea of jacking up the price for everyone because some of the people I represent would die of hypothermia. We must strike a balance that achieves a reduction in price while providing an energy system that uses a range of sources, moving away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy. I believe that NFFO is a good mechanism, which is why the Government extended it to NFFOV. I am keen to promote it in Europe rather than go towards crude energy taxes or price fights that would price people into different types of energy. That just cannot be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is encouraging that wind power, for example, is becoming viable because its per therm unit cost is decreasing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister but I should be grateful if he would address the Chair. I say this not out of vanity but because the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporter cannot hear him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. I have a habit of speaking directly to the person who spoke to me. I am grateful for your reminder. In 10 years of speaking in the House I have not got used to talking to people with my back to them. I will do my best to address you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems arise if price is the only mechanism to be considered. If we concentrate only on low price, we shall not achieve our aim; NFFO cuts across that. The programmes that Europe will build will undercut, so we cannot just leave matters to the market because nothing will happen. My problem is that renewables have been treated as marginal, fringe-ish and not greatly important. I believe that by 2050 renewable energy will be regarded much more positively and that people will look back on fossil fuels as a brief 100-year aberration in the history of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is concerned about the possible trade distortions of an internal market in electricity, why is there no mention in the White Paper of measures to prevent trade-distorting subsidies by individual members states, and why is there no reference to a directive or to a wish for other action by the Community in the Department of Trade and Industry's explanatory memorandum? Also, why is the Minister not proposing to raise the matter at the coming Council meeting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not write the Commission's White Paper. I do recall references in it to trade distortions. The hon. Gentleman emphasises that trade distortions should be taken more seriously. I agree, and I will give a practical reason why. When we were pushing through the gas directive to open up the gas market, a problem arose. Britain wishes to support combined heat and power. Other member states said that if we did so we would distort the market. Some of them wanted to clamp down on the notion of combined heat and power. We must find a way of ensuring that policies to promote renewables do not contradict policies for opening up trade and do not shut down their potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may be right in saying that we must consider the impact of distortion. One item on the Council of Ministers' agenda is the opening up of the market to energy liberalisation. A following item relates to ways of ensuring that one policy is not undermined by another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The section on consultation in the DTI's explanatory memorandum refers exclusively to consultation with industry. I am a new Labour Member of Parliament to my fingertips, and totally enthusiastic about this subject. However, I do feel that other groups might reasonably be consulted. It might be open minded of us to talk to some of the environmental groups to hear their views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Page 25 of the White paper refers to communities. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order to achieve the objectives for renewables, a major effort will be required to harness the potential, influence and experience of all manner of associations and bodies such as citizens' groups, … non-governmental organisations, and pressure-groups"</p></blockquote>
and so on. I underline those most welcome comments. People may say that we are not sufficiently supportive of renewables, but there is still opposition to them. Lord Ridley rightly and presciently referred to NIMBY—"not in my back yard." I am told that we have moved on from NIMBY to BANANA—"build absolutely nothing anywhere near me." Americans refer to NOPE—"not on planet Earth."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local opposition to renewable energy projects is the most difficult problem that we face. Whenever such a project is proposed, local people oppose it. We must ensure that local communities feel that they own such projects, and that they are for people's benefit. I visited Barrow-in-Furness, in Cumbria, where local people support a wind farm scheme that they feel is their own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And who opened it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he opened it? If he did, I congratulate him on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister return to the question of the significance of the 12 per cent. target for energy use? Clearly, he is not comfortable with that. Does he think that such a general declaratory target is not useful at a European level, or does he think that it is too ambitious? If he thinks the latter, what would be a more realistic level for the European Community as a whole to aim for?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My problem with the target is that it is unclear. Page 7 of the explanatory memorandum gives a figure of between 9.9 and 12.5 per cent. If Britain remained at 2 per cent. and did not enhance its programme with additional measures, we would achieve 8 per cent. within the European Union. We have set targets of 5 per cent. by the year 2000, and 10 per cent. by 2010. That will be a significant contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Confusion exists between electricity generation and energy use, which involves transport as a whole. I am examining local authorities' use of street cleaning and waste collection vehicles, which do not need to travel at 100 mph for 400 miles on a single can of petrol. Such short-range vehicles can travel between local points, and use local gas and electricity. They would thus make a different type of contribution to the reduction of energy consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked where the target figure came from, and the answer was, "We've not really thought about that because we're not sure." We must assemble a package of policies that includes energy efficiency, transport, and energy generation. My section of the Department is currently focusing on electricity and energy generation. Our targets are more ambitious than the Commission's, and we want to push people to achieve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once a clear distinction is made between gross inland energy consumption and electricity generation, I will be happier to accept the target. It is not too ambitious, and I am not opposed to targets as such. However, we must know what the target is, so that we can achieve it. Otherwise, like many other targets, it will remain notional and it will be regarded as unachievable. I want a positive, practical programme to achieve that target by 2010.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not need a top-down approach so much as a complete change of attitude towards renewable energy in local government, in small and medium-sized businesses, and elsewhere. Will the Minister explain how we can best educate and increase the awareness of all levels of society about those issues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, there are existing examples. Local authority energy advice centres provide information and advice on energy efficiency. That is a start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies and industry must learn that energy could be the bottom line. A heavy metal manufacturing company in my constituency told me that it would have to sack 10 employees because the wage bill was too high. I asked about energy consumption, and the response was, "Is that a factor?" I pointed out that bills can be affected by the time at which electricity is purchased. I also suggested that, in consultation with the workers, the shift system might be changed so that energy could be purchased at a different time. The company took my advice, and as a result employed five more people instead of sacking 10. Many local authorities and voluntary bodies such as the Energy Saving Trust give companies practical

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
advice about energy efficiency and energy audits. I hope that the SAVE programme will be instrumental in extending that process throughout Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was absolutely right. Focusing simply on price means that people will burn energy and it will pour out through the gaps in their doors and windows. Buildings must be energy efficient in order to save money and conserve resources. Using energy wisely will involve a cultural change, but the way forward is being shown by the SAVE programme and the educational programmes that the Government have initiated in Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the differences between the planning systems of European Union countries and the impact of that upon the generation of renewable energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that there have been difficulties in this country in bringing practical and applicable renewable projects to fruition because of the existing planning system. Does the Minister think that there is a danger that we may be forced to change our land-use planning system in response to EU prescriptions about the percentages of energy that must be generated through renewable sources? Inevitably, a large proportion of the UK's renewable energy generation will derive from wind, biomass and waste to energy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point. I hope that our planning system will not change. We must remain focused on the scale of the problem and the challenges involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some renewable energy will be generated under local community and local company energy schemes. Under such schemes, local communities and companies generate their own energy from waste, methane, combined heat and power or biomass. We should hold on to the principle by which local communities make decisions about what goes on in their area. That is why the planning system is separate from the NFFO process, and needs to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might, perhaps, favour a centralised solution by which I can say, "You will have biomass or a wind farm, whether you like it or not". However, that approach would not necessarily gain popular support for renewable energy schemes, which must be seen to be advantageous to local communities. That is why the British planning approach—from the base up—is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the range of renewable energy schemes across Europe, it is clear that planning decisions on a massive hydro scale are straightforward. In Britain, the decision to build a huge dam or power station is always made at national level rather than by a local community. There is a tension between the local and the national in terms of scale. Some European countries favour a top-down, Government-instructional approach. However, I hope that in Britain there will be a proliferation of small-scale projects supported by the local planning process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not heard it suggested that planning rules will be harmonised throughout Europe—that is not on. However, all member states will need to resolve the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
tension between local projects and national strategies. Local people must have their say, because the schemes will be near to them. It is not sufficient for people to say, "We want renewable energy, but not near us. We do not want to live near a power station." When they subsequently find that they are at the end of a long transmission wire and that they are being charged for transmission losses, they may say then that they want cheap power. People cannot have it both ways. The strategy must be tailored to local needs, but it should also enable us to develop and enhance renewables on a smaller scale across a range of options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What sort of negotiations are taking place with energy companies, in this country and the rest of Europe, about meeting some of the targets for the generation and supply of electricity from renewable sources? Eastern Electricity has a good scheme, but the cost of it falls on the consumer. The costs of meeting the objectives should be shared by the electricity companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to encourage more investment in research and development and in demonstrator projects by energy generating companies and by companies that generate in-house energy. The way to do that is to plough some of their profits back into such investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of Britain's major energy generators are starting to invest. National Power, PowerGen and water companies are considering investing in renewable technologies. Greater investment will streamline the technology. The size of turbines used in wind technology is now half what it used to be. Energy efficiency has improved twofold, thus reducing the scale of the technology. Noise levels, which people often complain about, are down. Technological improvement needs research and development which, in turn, requires investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the power generators to start thinking about investing in renewable energy. Some of them have done that already, and others should follow their lead. The idea is not to price renewable energy out of the market but to provide a special option for power generators that feel like being green and can afford it. I want green and renewable energy to be integrated into the whole energy system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply to my question on targets; I admire his search for clarity. Will he develop his reply and say what he feels about the Campaign for Take Off, which has clear, specific objectives, especially on photovoltaic penetration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Campaign for Take Off proposals are general and wide, but I cannot see how they will be applied in detail. There is a suggestion that a million photovoltaic systems will be put up. When I read about that in the documentation I thought that the whole of Europe would be provided with a million photovoltaic systems; but when I read the small print, I realised that the figure was only half a million. The other half a million systems are to be built as a result of investment in developing countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
I welcome intermediate technology. Ironically, renewable technologies will encourage competitiveness and energy provision in third world countries. However—to mix metaphors—it is a smokescreen to suggest that a million homes in Europe will be covered with photovoltaic systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Campaign for Take Off proposes to generate 10,000 megawatts from large wind farms. Where will those farms be situated? We need to think that out, as there may not be space in some places for more wind farms. I want to examine offshore wind energy rather than inland wind energy projects for Britain. That is more environmentally acceptable and it is the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how that target relates to the figure of 10,000 megawatts. The documentation cites 10,000 MW of biomass installations. How will that be squared with proposals in the common agricultural policy that undermine the biomass potential? The target has not been thought through properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the integration of renewables into 100 communities. I would like to know which communities are to be chosen: are they rural, or are they in cities such as the one I represent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the aims of Campaign for Take Off, but I am tempted to say that take off has already happened. We need to think about developing the initial spark, and putting the ideas into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission does not regard Campaign for Take Off as a means of setting achievable targets, but as a public media campaign. I welcome the campaign as a way of changing the culture, as hon. Members have suggested. It will raise awareness and kick-start interest in renewable energy. However, to be completely honest, its targets are of the "back of the envelope" variety. Those targets are not unattainable, but they need to be considered in detail. National strategies need to be put in place to achieve targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), the problem with photovoltaics and solar panels is the expense. The cost of technology must be driven down if it is to be installed in new homes. More than half of Britain's housing stock is more than 100 years old, so we are examining renovation and renewal programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not all of Britain's housing faces south. We must examine how to use photovoltaics in the difficult circumstances that characterise the regeneration and renewal of housing stock. That is a technological problem that some of those working on photovoltaics have failed to address. Solar technology is not as suited to Britain as it might be, and so costs are prohibitive. If costs are reduced, there will be a genuine opportunity for renewable energy sources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are used to seeing the poorest countries in Africa short changed by the European Union as a result of the priority given to eastern Europe and the mediterranean. On page 59 of the document before us is a list of the priority areas for the SYNERGY programme. At the top of the list we find
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
the usual suspects—eastern Europe and the mediterranean—but Latin America, Asia and Africa are at the bottom of the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that that priority is wrong, For instance, Africa has substantial potential for using renewable energy, particuarly solar energy. If Africa continues its deforestation at the current rate, it will have a significant impact on the climate; yet it is close enough to us to be an interesting and attractive market for renewable energy technology. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to suggest to his European colleagues that Africa should be given a higher priority than, for instance, Latin America.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred earlier to the common agricultural policy and the need for policies to operate throughout Europe. One directorate general in the EU—I believe that it is DG VIII—deals with development and co-operation, primarily with the former Commonwealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Latin American is an adjunct to that; the list focuses primarily on Africa. I hope that connections will be made betweeen the work of DG VIII and DG XVII on development projects, including energy development projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new framework includes TACIS and PHARE, the programmes to open the Community to former Russian and eastern European countries, but we must also link those programmes with DG VIII programmes on development. SYNERGY is not simply about joining up programmes and possibilities within Europe, not even if we include those countries that border Europe; it must also deal with development programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development potential of that technology, even if it is built and developed elsewhere, is a win-win situation. For once, technological expertise in energy generation—with turbines and the rest—can be used by developing countries to create the energy needed to help liberate their economies. The technology will not be mega power-station scale; it will be an appropriate intermediate technology, which will fit nicely with development programmes. Yes, it will mean development work and exports for us, but it will also create jobs in African countries. When we next debate these matters, I shall ensure that SYNERGY is cross-referenced to DG VIII, which deal with development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that the dual legal basis of articles 235 and 130s(1) would have been appropriate, but the Commission may have discounted that because of the difficulty of using a legal base that required procedures involving co-operation and consultation with the European Parliament. There seemed to be a bit of a wrangle about whether to use one or the other, but article 235 seems to have been chosen on the basis that it is about using a new technology rather than tackling the environment.

Some countries do not want targets, others think that the proposed targets are easy—perhaps because they produce much hydro power—and others think that there should be a range of lower targets. However, we all agree that each member state should start to work on the targets in detail and produce a positive, practical proposal. Those proposals can be aggregated to find out what can be done across the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Member states have seen our proposals, and I hope that they are reasonably encouraged by our response. I hope that they will view the document as more than a working text. I hope that we can work with it, agree to it and take forward the proposal. I do not expect much dissent from the proposal—that is, of course, if the Committee agrees to take it forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is good to hear the Minister's assurances about working towards a European-wide policy on renewable energy. I should like the Minister to comment on an important matter, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) has referred. When the policy is agreed, how will it be monitored and managed to ensure that it is pursued? Would not it be a good idea to have interim targets along the way? They would show how far we have moved towards the overall target, or, if we are falling behind, what needs to be done to boost us towards meeting it in the longer term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 5140/98, a Commission White Paper entitled 	<i>Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy,</i> the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum on the Council Resolution on Renewable Sources of Energy submitted by the Department of Trade and Industry on 16th March 1998, and European Community Document No. 13035/97, Annex I (a draft Decision adopting a multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector (1998–2002)), Annex IV (a draft Decision adopting a multiannual framework programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community: ALTENER II (1998–2002)), Annex V (a draft Decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency (1998–2002): SAVE II), and Annex VI (a draft Decision adopting a multiannual programme of technological actions promoting the clean and efficient use of solid fuels: CARNOT (1998–2002)); and supports the Government's view that actions should be taken to promote a greater use of renewable energy within Europe, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, and that measures to promote renewables shold be compatible with the need to restrain public expenditure and avoid disproportionate costs for consumers and industry; and supports the Government's view that EU spending programmes with an energy component should, as far as practicable, be brought together in a framework programme to improve co-ordination and transparency.—[	<i>Mr. Battle.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that this debate has attracted much attention and I shall be as brisk as I can to allow other hon. Members to contribute. First, I thank the Minister for attempting to answer the interesting questions that hon. Members have asked. However, he has not increased our knowledge of, for example, CARNOT—about which the Government, given that they have the presidency, could have found out more by now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to leave the impression that we can deal with such matters on our own; they are still under discussion. I hope that an acceptable, common solution can be agreed, but we cannot decide the legal basis and just tell everyone else—we have to agree it, and it is still under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall pass on from that point, except to say that I would have thought that, given that they have the presidency, the Government—if no one else—could have elicited an answer from the Commission. I was about to say that, on the more substantial issues than the purely legalistic ones, the Minister is obviously an enthusiast. He has tended to allow his enthusiasm to run beyond some of the narrower issues that are the proper remit of European Standing Committee B. Indeed, he has glossed over some of the conceptual difficulties in trying to marry his overall objectives in the presidency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister has said, the Government are interested in jobs, the environment and the single market, but there is tension between those interests. If too much is done on the environment and if there are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
too many incentives of a certain type, the Minister might impair competitiveness, which would affect jobs. However, if he tunes matters correctly—and he was generous about the previous Government's work on the non-fossil fuel obligation, the Energy Saving Trust and so on—he might achieve some of his objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the Committee to focus on some of the constraints and difficulties, and I shall try to expose them in my speech. However, I would like the Committee to think that I am equivocal in my wish to see a flourishing, expanding green energy sector in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to associate myself, as a co-sponsor, with the Energy Efficiency Bill, which was introduced as a private Member's Bill. I have fairly close contacts with the Association for the Conservation of Energy and, as a former Minister in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under the previous Government, I had direct involvement with the green energy side of MAFF, with Peter Billings and British Biogen. Fascinating work is going on, which has not yet been brought to the Committee's attention, but some of my hon. Friends may want to refer to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that we have good technology in this country, but I stress that there are major international opportunities. I am interested not only in maximising the European share but in ensuring that Great Britain, with its distinctive technologies, can market and develop its product for overseas as well as domestic use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made my preparatory remarks, I should stress that however great our moral commitment, we must not let our enthusiasm run ahead of our capacity for dispassionate analysis. We must focus on what we can do. Bearing in mind the fact that our remit is to operate as European Standing Committee B, why is it appropriate that such activity should take place at the European level? My hon. Friends, who are regular members of the Committee, ask that question persistently and rightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our exchanges so far, it is clear that there is a practical distinction between member states. For reasons that are not at all sinister, but more to do with geography, economic history and the presence of the North sea, the United Kingdom is a tail-ender in relation to renewable energy. Figures vary from between 0.5 and 0.7 per cent. of our total energy use and less than 1 per cent of our electricity use. On the other hand, Austria and Sweden, which have huge hydro-electric potential, operate at about a quarter of their generating capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently met people from the old hydro board in Scotland who explained their plans for new fossil fuel developments alongside their existing hydro capacity. Limits exist across Europe and we could not build a huge or expanded renewable sector on hydro alone, even if we could afford it and it had no environmental downsides. The Minister was right to express concern about wind farms onshore, for example, and we must
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
always recognise that however desirable green energy may be, it does not always come free, either in cost or planning terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in the United Kingdom—and, indeed, Holland—start from a completely different position from, say, Austria or Sweden. We must also consider the relationship with the Kyoto targets and how they will work nationally. The matter was teased out a little earlier; it is a sensitive issue and the extent to which it is dirigiste, or constrains a particular country's development, should concern us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two other variables on which we should spend a little time. First, we should consider the relationship of renewable energy to other means of benign energy use, including energy saving. Combined heat and power is not strictly a renewable, but it is a conservation—or greater efficiency—measure. Conservation activities themselves should also be considered. If the Minister is agreeing to their part in the European programme, they must be seen alongside the alternatives, which could be used, possibly, to get more bang for our buck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider, too, the relevance of the liberalisation of European energy markets. If that drives down prices throughout Europe, that may, prima facie, increase energy usage throughout Europe, unless other factors are built in. Obviously, the Minister is aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important matter, which has been delicately touched on in the Commission's White Paper is the situation in eastern Europe and the African countries. The Minister will know the dreadful environmental record of some of those countries and their waste of energy over the years; it was almost regarded as free, and little good it did them. The oblique message from the Commission papers is that the existing 15 member states may have to do still more because the applicant countries have not got to first base yet. Initially they would not be able to achieve much at all, due to their low capital stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far the balance between the different sectors of benign energy use has not been defined; neither has the question of whether initiatives should be applied at European or national level. I am amazed that the Commission's White Paper proposes studies of the national situation—a tour de table, as it were—without having analysed it so as to decide what to do next. I should be delighted if the Minister were to sell the NFFO concept to the Commission—by that I mean "sell" in inverted commas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a long way to go. The Minister makes that clear in the explanatory memorandum of 16 March, in which the United Kingdom's position is officially defined as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"enthusiasm for the Commission's initiative, tempered with a strong dose of realism."</p></blockquote>
That strikes me as being pretty damning. It could be taken to mean that the Government are signed up to the Commission's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman opened his remarks by saying that I let my enthusiasm run ahead of dispassionate analysis. He cannot have it both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to explain that. I meant that we saw Battle mark 1 earlier on, leaping forth with enthusiasm. Battle mark 2—or Sir Humphrey backing Battle—is saying, "Think again, Europe. This is something you must be a little careful about."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hardly surprising that we should draw back from enthusiasm when we look at the large capital costs implied by the figures in the Commission's White Paper. The cost of 165 billion ecu involves an additional net investment of about 74 billion ecu over the investment that would be required to provide fossil fuel facilities. The White Paper's priorities should be tested against other methods of spending to improve the environment, for example by infrastructure investment such as flue gas desulphurisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Does he agree with the Minister that the Government's enthusiastic approach is correct, does he favour a cautious approach or is he not sure either way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a good idea to approach the subject with a degree of moral enthusiasm. The Government and I do so. As the Government have made clear, that enthusiasm needs to be focused upon specific issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's White Paper refers primarily to private sector investment. It is not my role to devise the ground rules for the planning of that investment. The Commission has produced figures, targets and aspirations that are rather disturbingly round. Should those be supported by the private sector to the tune of 165 billion ecu, or 74 billion ecu of additional capital expenditure? Consideration needs to be given to whether that money is being used to the best effect to achieve the best environmental results. For example, an accelerated run-down and redundancy of the existing capital stock may be involved. The hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) rightly raised the issue of coal-fired power stations in that context. I and some of my colleagues are worried about the Environment Agency's recent response to the sulphur protocol.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that he set those conditions when he was in Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says, but I recall that the proposals amount to a substantial acceleration of the Government's previous timetable, and that they go beyond that in certain respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister knows what is going on behind his back. The Deputy Prime Minister has assured me that the Government will examine sulphur emission targets carefully, and that the timetable for consultation on them has been extended. I have put down a marker on the matter; it is not cost free, and it extends beyond the current debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one thing to be committed to renewables—I sympathise with the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology's remarks about the secular shift towards more decentralised generation—but we must consider the timing of that commitment. Even if it is to be substantially financed by the private sector, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
programme that the Commission has set out is not affordable. The Minister has implied that in his own memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed whether the Minister or I were enthusiastic about the European proposals. I have some markers to put down about the Minister's enthusiasm for the framework programme. I understand his wish to bring all the European actions within a common framework; he will be familiar with such an approach in science and research. There is an argument for doing so, particularly if resources are properly allocated. However, it is unacceptable to take unspent money from an area in which there is nothing to do, and to use it to prop up an unsatisfactory programme in another area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public sector costs are themselves significant. For example, 100 mecu has been allocated to wind, and 40 mecu to biomass. Doubt also exists about the balance that has been struck between the various elements that are proposed for the public sector. The table on page 23 of the White Paper shows that renewables bag just over 81 mecu, fuel efficiency gets 68.4 mecu, and clean coal—or clean technologies, to use the Minister's phrase—gets only 4.1 mecu. That balance may be the cause of some concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A certain degree of shading is discernible in the Minister's attitude as expressed in the various and copious explanatory memorandums that the presentation of documents has necessitated In the memorandum dated 16 January, he is positive about the proposals, and says that they are entirely consistent with subsidiarity and need to be implemented at a European level. In the supplementary memorandum of 9 March, which relates to the SYNERGY programme, a concern is clearly expressed that the Commission's boring out of its international programme has been taken too far. Understandably, the Government have been cagey about subsidiarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want to see advances made in renewable energy. However, the Opposition question whether the matter has to be dealt with at a European level. Such an approach must always be tested and shown to add value to the process. We question the relative costs of such advances, and the manner of their implementation, in the light of other priorities that may be equally benig and important. We also question whether such advances can be adequately financed by public expenditure within notoriously overstretched European budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear which gallery the hon. Gentleman is playing to. Is he against European programmes on renewable energy per se? Is he saying that we should carry on at a local level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made my position abundantly clear. The Committee's job is to scrutinise, and to tease from Ministers the justification for their energy policy. The Committee must also establish that more value and benefit can be derived from conducting matters at a European than at a national level. Those demands are perfectly reasonable, but I am not sure that the Minister has met them fully yet. He may well
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
say that getting together and agreeing on something is the best that we can do. If so, let us do that with our eyes open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not let our hearts rule our heads. The Minister will have widespread support from the Committee if he encourages a proper focus on realistic efforts to improve green energy at European Union and national levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will also need to avoid dirigisme from the Commission on sources and types of renewable energy and on the setting of uniform targets. I notice the Minister nodding: that suggests he understands that there is a huge disparity between different countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the Minister should confine centralised action by the European Union to cases which would clearly benefit from it and in which the cost effectiveness can be demonstrably justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admire the Minister's enthusiasm and dispassionate analysis: he demonstrates that those qualities are not incompatible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 15 or 16 years ago I was in a different job and was responsible for writing about energy policy. I drafted a report entitled "A planned energy policiy". It was unfashionable to talk about planning at the time, but I thought that it was relevant then—as I do today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are allowed to use the word "planning" provided the little word "strategic" is put in front of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. friend the Minister for his correction. I wrote about policy on UK energy provision. I take the point made by the Opposition spokesman that every country in the world has its own pattern of energy provision with consequent advantages and disadvantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, energy policy and energy production are matters of global interest, as Kyoto demonstrated. A country's energy production impinges on other countries. Energy policy is an international matter, and so it is a legitimate subject of scrutiny for the EU, which should engender in member states the best approach to energy policy, both nationally and collectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixteen years ago Britain had publicly owned coal, gas, electricity, oil and nuclear industries. The world has changed radically, but at that time we gave insufficient consideration to renewables and their possibilities. I remember pressing the case for devoting more resources to research into renewables and for looking more realistically to the long-term future in which renewables would play a much larger part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That debate continues. It is strange to make almost the same speech today as I did then. The organisation that I worked for was outwards looking and did not confine itself to the UK. I remember talking to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
European colleagues who were into market forces: their eyes would glaze over when I talked about planning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is focusing on research and discussing renewable energy. I imagine that he is thinking about new renewable technologies. Does he agree that it is unhelpful to find figures lumping hydro in with more novel forms of renewable technology? The argument is obscured by large percentages which mainly refer to hydro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. It is unfortunate that renewables are grouped together because some technologies do not require much research. In domestic solar heating, for example, research is done into basic technology. Investment and installation rather than research are the priorities. Other forms of renewable energy need research and larger-scale production to reduce costs to make them a more realistic prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different renewables are used in different countries. The wet weather we are experiencing today means that photovoltaics will not be as successful here as they are in Spain. Despite that, a rational, long-term, planned approach to benefit future generations is essential. We must be realistic, examine relative costs and take account of markets and market forces. We should intervene in the energy market. We have done so historically: for example, we do not allow the market to decide how much we pay for petrol. Nuclear energy has been heavily subsidised and German coal is so heavily subsidised that it could be given away free in Britain with £10 on top. We intervene, as does Europe, but we must discuss how and where to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to domestic heating. It is right to ensure that the less well off and the elderly are kept warm in winter. The warm homes initiative is valuable and we should all support it, but the matter could be approached in a different way. Greater emphasis should be placed on domestic solar heating and more investment in energy-efficient homes and insulation. Sixty years ago in Sweden it was a requirement that every home was triple glazed. We have only started to think about double glazing in the past couple of decades and even now many homes are not double glazed, especially where people are less well off. Many homes, even now, do not have properly insulated roof spaces. We have a long way to go. The market has been too dominant and intervention has been too little to ensure progress and that old people keep warm in winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsidy approach is relevant to domestic and commercial building. Sixteen years ago—I am sure that it is still so—commercial buildings and factories were built to minimise contruction costs and subsequent rents. Construction is not dominated by Government concern for energy efficiency because it is more expensive to build an energy-efficient building. It is possible to construct buildings that require little more than body heat to heat them. It may be going too far to require that, but it is possible. Some hon. Members have been to Machynlleth in Wales to see the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
energy-efficient house where human beings walking about provide sufficient heat to keep the house warm. We could go much further in that direction, but intervention and planning would be required. It will not happen as a result of a market approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must press much harder in Europe and Britain for a more rational and planned approach to energy provision in the longer term. We may have cheap gas and oil and short-term profit now, but those are not the factors that should dominate energy provision. I hope that our Government will favour a planned approach instead of a short-term free market approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.53 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is frequently my role in the Committee to cast a damper on widespread enthusiams. I want to take up the point made by my hon. Friend, but in a sharper form of speaking from the relative freedom of the Conservative Back Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was charmed, as I am sure were all hon. Members, by the Minister's enthusiasm for renewable energy. He exhibited genuine personal enthusiam which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, we share. All my hon. Friends in the Committee have a history of involvement in renewable energy and I am a passionate enthusiast. It may surprise some members of the Committee to learn that I am entirely in favour of domestic subsidies for renewables if they are appropriately structured. I almost made that point several times earlier, but it has nothing to do with the subject of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is European Standing Committee B and we are investigating a proposition from the Commission. Our task is not to investigate whether renewables or subsidies for renewables are good, bad or indifferent. I think that they are good but that has nothing to do with the issue before the Committee, which is whether the White Paper that the Commission has put forward, and the Government's response to it, are appropriate. We should focus our remarks on that. The Minister did not once address that issue and nor can he.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To say that I have not addressed that point is an abberration. All hon. Members have a copy of the response to the White Paper that I shall put before the Council of Ministers. I would have been happy to spend all the time reading out the documentation but I took it as read.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not wish to suggest for a moment that the Minister did not advert sufficiently to the documentation, but he did not explain why he believes that the document before us, with the reservations he put forward, is broadly acceptable. He cannot explain that becuase it is not broadly acceptable. I can persuade the Committee of that in a mere 10 minutes—at least, I shall have a go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the whole of the White Paper the only argument made for action on renewables at Community level appears on three occasions, although I may have missed a fourth. I drew the Minister's attention to one example during questions—the argument on page 15 that it would distort the internal market in electricity
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
if member states took different approaches and did not act on a Community basis. That is true. In view of the French Government's failure to do anything about Electricité de France, and the Commission's lamentable failure to make progress, I do not know whether we will get an internal market in electriciy in the near future or later. But if and when, as we all desire, we get that internal market, based on a pooling system with proper interconnection and a proper basis for pricing across the load curve, it will be necessary to ensure that the subsidy mechanisms employed by member states do not distort it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this document has nothing whatever to do with that. The Commission seems to have gone into hiding on the subject, because it does not propose any mechanisms to address the problems that will arise. It does not suggest how subsidy mechanisms should be designed or what rules should be adopted to avoid distorting the market. It does not suggest how they would be implemented or enforced in the member states. In fact, it is wholly silent on those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission substitutes a mindless adherence to small-scale European subsidies for a proper approach to a real and advancing problem. The subsidies are small enough that the Minister, in his Tiggerish enthusiasm, and other similarly charming Ministers from other member states can say, "The subsidies do not cost much: we do not have to worry about whether they have the slightest intellectual coherence." They will agree to spend the money and impose a target, and then they will hope either that the implementation of the market will take so long that by then someone will be employed to develop a solution, or that there will never be an internal market. That is what the French participant at the meeting will be hoping because EDF strategy—and EDF sometimes seems more powerful than the French Government—has been to try to prevent such an internal market arising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As often from the hon. Gentleman, that is a very acute question. There is a clear answer. I am in favour of action of European level to ensure that the internal market is transparent and operates on a level playing field. Although I might quibble about the details and the implementation, I would be in favour if the document contained well-considered proposals that constrained but allowed properly tapered state aid so as not to distort the market betwee member states—when and if there is an internal market in electricity. Renewables must be subsidised. There is no realistic alternative if we want to achieve our common goals, but little money, probably spent badly—the Commission generally spends money badly—would almost certainly be against the interests of this country, because, for various reasons which I will not go into now, most of the money will go to other places.

The appropriate response from the Government to a paper so lamentably lacking in certain respects should have been a tart rejoinder. The Government have the great advantage of having the presidency and they could have taken more than just a national position. They should have been prepared to say to the Commission, "This is a serious issue. We entirely support the move towards renewable energy. We want an internal market"—I was pleased that the Minister said that that subject is on the agenda—"and we want you do do some proper homework on the matter. We want to know how we will get proper state aid, legitimised and constrained in order to have both renewable energy and an efficient energy market in Europe." There is no sign of such thinking, although that is not this Minister's failing; the problem has been going on for a long time and I do not want to make a party-political point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's Department, by which he has been gulled on this occasion, has not insisted that the European Commission thinks about the problem. If the Government have not insisted when Britain holds the presidency, they certainly will not do so on other occasions. As I said, at least one other major energy player in Europe virtually controls a Government through a state-owned elecrtricity company, and is determined to avoid making a reality of the internal electricity market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister expressed doubts about the legal basis for one or two of the proposed actions and he was honest enough to say that the Government were not clear how the Commission had chosen the legal basis for those actions. I am not clear about the legal basis for any of the actions: if the Commission had introduced a proposed directive or a White Paper that constrained state aid for a particular purpose in certain circumstances as part of the development of an internal market, the treaty would provide ample legal basis, but the proposal is for subsidy without justification in terms of subsidiarity. I looked through the paper trying to find something that would explain how the Commission's proposal was consistent with the principle of subsidiarity, but there was no such explanation. There is a pathetic, half-attempt at it, but—even by Commission standards—it is perfunctory. That is extraordinary and it raises the question whether the White Paper is proper in Commission terms, and whether it has the authority for the work that it is doing. That is of the utmost importance and the Minister should question whether the Commission's position is intellectually coherent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the Minister will not address these points in his closing remarks, or that he will skirt round the issue, because he may find it an uncomfortable suggestion that the presidency should ask what the Commission is doing producing a White Paper. I have not attended the meetings, as the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry have, so I may have misunderstood the matter, but the proposals in the White Paper appear to have been taken for granted, as has the Commission's right to produce such a document. What are we to do in response? This
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
example illustrates why such a dynamic is dangerous: the Commission imposes its will on a group of politicians simply by producing a large amount of paperwork that the politicians cannot match. The assembled politicians, democratically representing their electorates, should instead impose their will on the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made much of the Commission's White Paper, but I have the strong impression that he has not read our draft proposals. May I courteously ask him to consider them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 9 of our proposed response recognises that
	<br><blockquote><p>"different measures could lead to barriers to trade and other distortions of competition between Member States and takes note with interest of the Commission's report on harmonisation requirements in the framework of the Electricity Directive."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 19 invites the Commission to follow progress
	<br><blockquote><p>"including to review the working of the liberalised energy markets, and to make a progress report every year"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"to consider the need for proposals in order to remove obstacles to the greater use of renewables, and invites the Commission to develop and identify standards and indicators to … compare and measure results in this area."</p></blockquote>
That response addresses precisely some of the obstacles to which the hon. Gentleman referred.

We are not being asked to accept or reject the White Paper in toto, yes or no; we are being asked to approve our proposals in response to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but I have seen the document. I would have preferred it to have made the following points—the Commission has produced a White Paper which is wholly beside the point and which recommends a set of subsidies for which there is no intellectual, and possibly no legal, justification, and we would like the Commission to go back and start again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that had been the tone of the Minister's remarks, I agree that some of the substance of the Government's response, reformulated in the way that I have suggested and made vastly more powerful, would have achieved the effects that I seek. It is too much to hope that the Minister will rephrase his written documents. However, when he attends the Council meeting, I hope that some vague echo of my remarks will be in his mind—that is one of the purposes of this Committee—and he may perhaps be strengthened in a resolve to persuade the Commission to rework some of these matters. He might also question the proposed Community-wide subsidies for which there is no intellectual, nor possibly legal, basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This has been one of the healthier and more dispassionate of our debates in the Committee—a trend that I have noticed over our past few meetings. Those of us who are concerned that we have proper scrutiny of European legislation welcome that; whether it is the subject matter, or a maturing of the Committee remains to be seen.

Although I began in that non-partisan way, I should like to point out that we are right to criticise the situation that we inherited. There is a dispute about the figures; but 0.7 per cent. of our gross inland consumption is met from renewables, compared with a European Union average of 5.3 per cent. We can debate the ease with which other countries, because of their geographical structures, can produce more renewables. However, a critique can be made of the British Government's attitude, over decades, to renewable energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need much more long-term planning and a long-term view of the issues, in governmental thinking and in society at large. Short-term investment is needed for environmental reasons and for long-term financial gains. I had some experience of such matters in my previous existence as a university manager, when I authorised a combined heat and power scheme. As the hon. Member for Daventry said, such schemes do not necessarily relate to renewables, but they are conservation measures. The scheme required an investment of about £50,000, which had to be paid up front, but was to make a year-on-year saving by year three or four.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The investment value of such schemes, whether in the public or private sectors, is a matter for finely balanced judgments. We need to focus our thinking on such matters. The Government need to encourage a longer-term investment view at national and European level. The Government's macro-economic policy of providing more stability, so that businesses can make those long-term decisions in their interest, is essential. The public sector needs a long-term planning framework for Government funding streams. That will enable people to plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should not simply be a top-down approach, but a change throughout society in attitudes to renewable energy. Middle managers in the public sector, business people in small and medium-sized enterprises, and local councillors will all have to make such decisions. Therefore, we must focus on that from the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a process of education: first, through schools and secondly, by engaging media interest. Sometimes the issues that we are considering are presented as quirky and eccentric in newspapers and on television. Politicians have an important role to play in pushing those issues up the political agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the Government's view of the 12 per cent. target. Benchmarking targets for businesses, organisations and countries are necessary and the realisation of such objectives provides a sense of achievement. However, if the target is unrealistic, people will disregard it and believe it to be beyond them so we are right to enter the discussions with a healthy scepticism about the feasibility of the 12 per cent. target. I am sure that progress will be made at the Council meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe passionately that renewable energy is a matter for the European Union. Energy companies are often organised on a multinational basis, and preserving energy is an international issue. It is right for national initiatives to exist. As I said earlier,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
decisions on such matters are not primarily made by politicians. But there should be a European consensus and strategy. That is especially relevant when we consider enlargement, and energy sources and their management in former eastern bloc countries. We should be proactive, and use the enlargement discussions to resolve some of those problems. The way in which some former eastern bloc countries use and manage their energy sources and provide energy to their citizens is relevant to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I subscribe to the hon. Gentleman's view that the European Union should consider such issues and I hear his comments on enlargement, does he agree that that is not a reason for the European Union to use subsidies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a fundamental difference between us. I believe that subsidies should be properly justified and scrutinised, but there is a case for them, especially when we consider the fifth framework programme. It is right to use subsidies for research that will create long-term benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I began dispassionately, but I want to talk about an issue that underlines the fundamental difference between the approaches of the Government and the Opposition. The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about a moral commitment. I respect the hon. Gentleman, but renewable energy is not a moral or ethical issue. A business investment in plant and machinery, or in staff training, is not a moral matter. How energy is used and whether it will be renewable in the longer term are fundamental practical issues which should be addressed by business people, society at large and politicians. I repeat that it is not primarily about morality but about preserving our energy sources and ensuring that they will be available for ourselves and future citizens. I endorse the Government's approach. Many issues remain to be discussed at the Council of Ministers but we are proceeding in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.16 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I start by adding to the general air of bonhomie by thanking the Minister for his enthusiasm and obvious grasp of the technical detail, which has greatly helped our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mixed feelings about the White Paper, and I agree with many of the comments just made. There are two positive aspects to it. The first is the ambition—it is right to be ambitious when confronting the global climate problem and meeting Kyoto targets. We must avoid the tendency to be complacent. Setting a more demanding target—12 per cent. for energy use as against 10 per cent. for electricity generation—pushes the envelope further, which I welcome. I hope that the Government can subscribe to that target, though I accept the Minister's point about the lack of clarity. We need to specify more clearly what the proposals mean at a sectoral and national level. The Government should at least endorse the underlying ambition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second positive aspect is the fact that there is a clear European framework. I feel strongly that we are dealing with a European issue. Narrow subsidiarity
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
does not apply. We should consider the time horizon of the objectives. There will be a single European market not only in electricity generation, reinforced by directives and the grid, but in gas, which has been strengthened by the interconnector and the transport systems. National Governments are spontaneously sprouting national systems of energy taxation, which will lead to distortions within the European Union unless a framework is in place to deal with the problem at the European level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the appropriateness of European Union action on these matters is dependent on the achievement of the single market in electricity generation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The single market in electricity generation, as the hon. Gentleman's colleagues have already implied, is a major driver and a major reason why the European Union must take a view on aggregate emissions from Europe as well as on national targets. The fact that there will be single market in electricty generation is highly germane and provides the European Commission's position with basic legitimacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, although it is right to have a European framework, there remains a lack of intellectual clarity in the Commission's paper. I agree with some but not all of the criticisms that hon. Members have made. I remain sceptical when the arguments frequently depart from environmental objectives. The only serious argument for adopting a tough approach on targets and subsidies is the environmental objective of reducing CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. That is what the renewable debate is all about, yet the Commission has been unable to resist the temptation to drag in all sorts of other arguments which, frankly, are irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take issue with the notion that being self-sufficient in energy is inherently desirable. Why should we be self-sufficient in energy? The Common Market's—agricultural policy was distorted for many years as a result of the obsession with self-sufficiency. The problems that led to the fear of being energy dependent—inevitably the oil shock—are no longer the same. Circumstances have changed and the growing gas sector provides increasing diversity of supply. As I said, there is nothing inherently desirable about self-sufficiency, and the European Commission does not help its own case by bringing in extraneous arguments of dubious merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What of the broad approach outlined in the Commission's White Paper? The Minister partly captured the key point about diversity. We should not be in the business of picking winners. The disastrous experience of nuclear power has taught us powerful lessons. A diverse approach involves a variety of objectives, including energy conservation. Gas has played a major role in reducing carbon emissions, and we have a wide variety of renewable sources. We do not yet know which of those will be commercially competitive in 20 to 30 years. It would be ludicrously unwise to try to predict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
We should create a policy framework in which all renewable energy sources can be the subject of experimentation, and all are available to the market. How can that be done? The key point of the White Paper, although it is often couched in rather dirigiste terms—presumably French officials drafted it—is the acknowledgement that most of the investment will be made in the private sector. I speak from experience, as I was in the oil and gas industry. The major enterprises in that industry are already investing heavily in renewable sources—not for charitable or idealistic reasons, but for good, long-term strategic reasons. They think 50 to 100 years ahead. The big oil majors were in business 100 years ago and expect to be in business in another 100 years. They see the future in terms of solar power and other renewable sources, so they are investing in them. However, the private sector will inevitably under-invest unless a system of taxation or subsidies reflects the externalities generated by environmental pollution. We should be aiming at a system of tax incentives and subsidies, at national and European levels, that deals properly with those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly beyond the scope of the present debate to argue in detail about a system such as I have outlined, but the Commission has set out in the annex to the White Paper a set of 39 initiatives, many of which are part of the appropriate philosophy. I should hope that the Government would argue for a forward-thinking approach to energy taxation. The Budget contained an interesting one-liner, in which the Chancellor trailed the idea of industrial energy taxation related to carbon content. I do not know how far the Government have advanced that thought, but it would be a powerful mechanism not merely for dampening energy demand in industry but for helping the switch to low-carbon sources. I hope that that will be an important instrument in long-term Government thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An approach that I should like to be used at retail level is the VAT mechanism. Its use for energy conservation has been explored rather timidly. It could be used in many ways. To promote renewable energy, the VAT exemptions could relate to renewable energy products in the household sector, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been little discussion of the non-fossil fuel obligation, which is clearly an important part of the story. Some useful comments on the subject were made in the inquiry by the Select Committee on trade and Industry. I hope that the Minister will take into account some of the evidence that although NFFO is a valuable mechanism—for the introduction of which the previous Government deserve credit—it needs to be refined to take account of long-term renewable energy, as opposed to forms that are of immediate commercial benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about the use of VAT to increase or reduce prices. Does he agree that the impact of that approach is sometimes marginal, although it is legitimate to reduce VAT on fuel as a supporting mechanism? Would not it be more beneficial to tackle the capital costs of installation of renewable energy sources? Would not the direction of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
subsidies to initial capital costs, rather than usage price, be more likely to promote alternative energy use?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Clearly, the big changes that will take place in industry and the energy sector will depend greatly on the tax treatment of capital allowances as they apply to equipment. I mentioned VAT merely because one sphere of useful change, which we have hardly touched on, is household consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One great theme of the paper is the spreading of solar power units in domestic households. This may not be wholly appropriate in the United Kingdom for climatic reasons, but it is important at the margin. If it were to be encouraged, one obvious way would be to encourage consumers to install equipment, and VAT exemption would be one of the mechanisms. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is no massive capital investment implication, but it is a useful idea that ought to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government respond to the White Paper, I hope that they will, at the very least, convey their endorsement of the ambitious objectives that the Commission is trying to set, with its evident commitment to big reductions in CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. The mechanisms are a second order problem. Many of the Minister's comments on them are correct. This country has adopted a system that is now more reliant on the market, and less dirigiste. I see no incompatibility between that and being ambitious about the environment. I hope that the Minister will endorse the Commission's broad ambitious targets, whatever the qualification about clarity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.27 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to begin with the basic question of why we are all so enthusiastic about renewable energy because we have more or less taken that as a given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for renewable energy was summarised in various parts of the paper. The central point is, as has been said, the Kyoto agreement and the achievement of limits on CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. Secondary points are long-term sustainability within the European Union, and the security of supply. Those of us who lived through the oil crisis would hesitate to endorse the view that it is inconceivable that anything like it could recur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept that triple targets are appropriate for the EU, it is clearly appropriate for it to approach this matter at the European level. Otherwise, it would be tempting for each EU country to think that the targets for reducing emissions and becoming more independent, and for sustainability in the long term, could safely be left to the others. I am reminded of an occasion in the Chamber when Mr. Deputy Speaker urged Members to make shorter interventions. I recall saying that if other hon. Members would shut up I could continue my speech. All Government bodies tend to think in that way. In my view, only by cooperation at European level can we bring about a sharing of an undoubted financial burden and achieve our goals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
What I think of as the creeping fungus of Euroscepticism has reached the matter through the interventions from those on the Conservative Benches. It was expressed in a slightly nebulous form by the hon. Member for Daventry, who thought that some of the programmes might not be appropriate and that we had to challenge whether subsidiarity had been sufficiently examined in this case. He expressed no opinion on whether it had; he merely challenged the point. The hon. Member for West Dorset, with his usual forensic clarity, said that he would like to see joint European action for agreement on the amount of subsidies to promote the idea, but that otherwise he saw no real role for the EU. There is a role in this area. The hon. Gentleman was right to identify subsidiarity as an issue that has not been discussed sufficiently in the current documents. There is also a role for coordination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because if we do not have a joint effort, we risk having no effort. It is not clear whether it would be in individual countries' interest to make a serious effort if others do not do so—the prisoner's dilemma.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that by working together we can promote best practice and learn from each other? We are much more likely to make better progress by reinforcing what is done by individual countries than by working separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about a joint effort, but does he see the effort as being proportionately the same among all the countries involved? One of the difficulties of a European programme is that, given that we start from a low base, the expectation is that we should have to make a disproportionate contribution, even if it might not otherwise be objectively justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. The question was raised earlier whether the reason for our low base was historical or geographical, or perhaps a combination of the two. It would be appropriate for our European partners to challenge us on that, asking whether we were really pulling our weight, just as we would wish to challenge them on whether their geographical advantages had not given them cause to relax more than they should. That would be an appropriate dialogue. I do not believe that we should mechanistically say that everyone should increase their efforts by exactly the same amount, but it would be natural for the European Union to have that dialogue and to attempt to reach an agreement on an appropriate sharing of the burden to reach the objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned earlier, the process is a little nebulous. There is an indicative target of 12 per cent., which we hope to reach, and an achievable target of 8 per cent., which, as the Minister so helpfully mentioned, we can reach without having to do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
anything. The working party that was recommended in the White Paper has so far met only once, but there is not much more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the coming months, I should like to see the working party promote the dialogue that we have been discussing, to try to set national targets and, as suggested by the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), to set limits on guidelines on appropriate subsidies. In parallel, each country should be working on short-term activities to get the ball rolling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly disagree with the Select Committee's suggestion that nations should do nothing while awaiting a guiding light from Europe. That seems uncharacteristically Euro-dirigiste. After a few months, the working party should be able to make recommendations to the Council of Ministers and make some concrete predictions of what can be achieved—it might be 11.3 per cent., 12 per cent. or even 12.2 per cent., with some interim milestones, as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling. It might also make some concrete proposals for how the burden should be shared nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that stage, perhaps a year or 18 months from now, all countries would have a clear picture of what the others were expecting of them and what they had committed themselves to achieving. On that basis, we would have quite a good chance of knowing where we were and where we are going, and of knowing that we could check in five years' time whether we had achieved our goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that other hon. Members wish to speak, but I wish to make one final but trivial point. It would help if the European Union dated its documents; if it will not, perhaps whoever compiles the index would do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.35 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am mindful of the time, Mr. Atkinson. Many points have been put to the Minister and I know that he will need some time to reply to them, so I shall endeavour to be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, which he expressed so eloquently. I infinitely prefer the Commission's White Paper to the Minister's draft resolution, but I congratulate the Minister on at least moving in the right direction—even if we wonder whether we have moved far enough. The Commission's White Paper is too interventionist and prescriptive. Perhaps the 12 per cent. total, despite the relatively woolly words that have been used to describe it in the documents of our debate, is unrealistic. The hon. Member for Broxtowe confused the 12 per cent. energy consumption total with the Minister's earlier reference to an 8 per cent. electricity generation total. Indeed, the Minister himself drew attention to the confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A 12 per cent. target is being proposed by the European Union. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry suggests from a sedentary position that it could perhaps be 24 per cent., which is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
significant, and would bring into account many different renewable energy and electricity generation matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's White Paper fails to address adequately the issue of liberalisation of the market, which is a key issue that should be dealt with first. We have heard various contributions that have been predicated on the idea that we will eventually—perhaps well before 2010—achieve an integrated single market in electricity generation in the European Union. I very much hope so, but I share the doubts of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset about whether that will happen. I should have liked the Commission's proposals to refer more specifically to the need to achieve that before going on, within the context of a single liberalised electricity market, to refer to increasing the share of renewables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for Community intervention has not been adequately made. The Commission seems to be proposing conditional subsidiarity. It will set targets, although it is not clear when such targets will be disaggregated into national targets. There will then be a period in which national Governments will use the menu approach to those targets, which the Minister advocates in his draft resolution. Different member states, having regard to their different industrial structures and according to their degree of advancement in relation to renewable energy, will select from the menu of different options the methods that they will use to promote the development of renewables. In the year 2000, the Commission will carry out a survey, and the White Paper states ominously that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if this indicates a remaining need for Union-level measures in certain of the areas listed, the necessary proposals will be put forward."</p></blockquote>
I can only describe that as conditional subsidiarity, which falls rather short of what we would want in terms of applying the subsidiarity principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point to which I draw the Committee's attention, which was absent from the Minister's argument, is the need for short-term subsidies in the renewable sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend continues with his interesting argument, does he agree that his point about conditional subsidiarity illuminates a great part of our debate? A parallel case would be if we were all in favour of literacy, but not every country had as much interest in subsidising it. There could then be an argument for Community-wide subsidies. My hon. Friend's interpretation seems to be that the Community should act only when the particular aims of the Community, as expressed in the treaties, can best be done at Community level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. It would be a dangerous precedent for the Community to set national targets with the implied threat of Community-level intervention if national Governments did not perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle underlying the United Kingdom's non-fossil fuel obligation regime is that renewable technologies—excluding hydro power, which, as I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
have said, is a possible cause of confusion—are infant industries and require subsidy to enable them to reach convergence with market pricing. That concept was wholly absent from the Commission's approach, although it mentions needing susidies to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. The Minister will agree that renewable energy needs initial subsidies to allow the technologies to develop to the point at which they can be genuinely competitive. I should have liked to have seen greater emphasis on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents refer to encouraging the development of technologies and industries within the European Union. I am slightly wary of the menu approach to national aid to renewable energy development because of the different conditions, technologies and industries which underlie renewable energy in each member state. It would be disastrous if, by creating an à la carte system, we were to allow member states to promote their pet industry projects. Instead of greater coherence across the European Union, that would cause fragmentation—different member states or groups of member states would encourage and develop their own industries, rather than look at the overall position.

In a lengthy intervention in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, the Minister made much of the precise wording of the draft resolution. As I have said, I found the draft resolution much more comfortable than the original White Paper. I asked the Minister what reaction the United Kingodm presidency was receiving from other member states. Without giving away any confidences, he implied that there is still much to be discussed before a consensus is reached on the draft resolution. Given the emphasis that the Minister places on the wording of the draft resolution, will he assure the Committee that the United Kingdom is not prepared to make significant concessions or move back in the direction of the prescriptive wording of the Commission's White Paper in seeking to agree a draft resultion and that, if necessary, the United Kingdom will simply block the resolution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the last point first. We intend to find out whether our response can be approved by the whole Council of Ministers. We view our response as a working text, and we are receiving encouraging support for it. I do not want to suggest that it is in a void or that there is no support for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) once told me that our proposal for the fifth framework programme had no chance, but we got it through. Perhaps I am over-optimistic to think that we shall achieve agreement on our proposal, which is a good one and represents a substantial increase. I hope that the Council of Ministers will agree to it unanimously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Committee for the tone, seriousness and quality of debate. I know that other hon. Members wanted to speak. I shall be delighted if this debate is replicated at the Council of Ministers. Jeremy Paxman once introduced me as the Minister for chicken litter—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
he used a different word for litter—to abuse and marginalise the idea of renewable energy. We must start to take such matters much more seriously, as the Committee has done this morning. If a debate of this quality is conducted at European level, it will go a long way along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell) to raise the tone of discussion and the consciousness throughout Europe of the fact that it matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some debate about whether this is a moral or economic issue. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow, who put it well, that this is a common sense economic and business issue. This is a three-term equation: win, win, win. It involves new science and engineering technologies. There must be research into those technologies; they must be developed. It also involves new jobs and employment issues, but it means tackling environmental challenges and solving the problems that we face. That is why we should go for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) said that each country has its own pattern, but stressed that he had been working on the matter for 16 years. Although each country has its own pattern and we come from different starting points, we must try to communicate and to share best practice. In his telling intervention he said that we can do best by comparing notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot have further discussion today on the NFFO support system. We have debated that previously and should continue to do so. My. hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North put it very well when he said how we intervene and where we intervene are the crucial questions, which we should continue to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the need to do more, my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow referred to the figure of 0.7 per cent. We have a long way to go. In March 1995, the previous Administration published projections for the United Kingdom in Energy Paper 65. Their forecast of fuel sources in 2010 was 93 per cent. fossil fuels, 5.5 per cent. nuclear and 1 per cent. renewables. The forecast for 2020 showed an increase in fossil fuels to 97.5 per cent. and a reduction in nuclear to 1 per cent., with renewables remaining at 1 per cent. We want a massive improvement in those figures to 10 per cent. and to break out of the complacency of not accepting targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
CARNOT is not the whole support system for clean coal; dissemination and shared information are necessary. There are other projects and the DUAL and THERMIE programmes and the European Coal and Steel Community also support clean coal. We should not forget them.

Reference was made to the diverse starting points of different countries. I have a helpful chart which I am happy to make available because it is illuminating. Germany is miles ahead of other countries in the Community, producing 159,000 tonnes of oil equivalent. Britain produces 39,000 tonnes and is third behind Germany and Denmark; so on wind we are not doing badly. Italy is almost the only country with geothermal and produces 2.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent. No other country gets a look-in on

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
geothermal because Italy has a geological advantage. On forest residue, France produces 8.1 million tonnes of oil equivalent, which is miles ahead of any other country—Britain produces only 270,000 tonnes. There are great differences and, surprisingly, Britain is miles ahead in municipal digestible and landfill gas. It all depends on the geographical circumstances, and we must campaign in Europe to maintain diversity, as the hon. Member for Twickenham said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Daventry referred to the framework. We are not discussing a reduction in budgets. We do not envisage funds being moved to prop up worthless initiatives. The idea is simply to ensure that there is no overlap, loss of momentum or discrepancies with projects being dropped. We need a framework that allows synergy, and I hope that there will be support for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Daventry referred to biomass, which features more strongly in the Commission's White Paper. The potential for biomass is stronger than for wind, hydro and other sources. I shall be meeting my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to examine the relationship between the proposals on the common agricultural policy and biomass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was also made to large-scale hydro power, which has an environmental downside in river depletion. There are no absolute environmental winners; there are always some disadvantages. That is why we must have the support of local communities. In Britain we want renewables to make a difference. Our aim is that 10 per cent. of electricity generation should come from renewables by 2010. That will require a fourfold to fivefold increase in renewable energy, and we shall introduce detailed proposals to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree with the suggestion of the hon. Member for West Dorset to go back to the Commission and start again. That is not practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Some of his concerns are covered in our response on the way in which the market opens up and so on. The draft resolution sets out the difficult middle way very well. It reflects the balance of official discussions that have already taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the White Paper and support its call for action. We believe that a strategic approach across Europe is necessary. It may be a catalyst for member states to follow our example and produce detailed action plans to promote renewable energy in the next century. Renewable energy is the energy of the future. We cannot allow it to be marginalised. We must campaign for it, get together and co-operate whenever we can to ensure that it has a future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 5140/98, a Commission White Paper entitled 	<i>Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy,</i> the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum on the Council Resolution on Renewable Sources of Energy submitted by the Department of Trade and Industry on 16th March 1998, and European Community Document No. 13035/97, Annex I (a draft Decision adopting a multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector (1998–2002)), Annex IV (a draft Decision adopting a multiannual framework programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community: ALTENER II (1998–2002)), Annex V (a draft Decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency (1998–2002): SAVE II), and Annex VI (a draft Decision adopting a multiannual programme of technological actions promoting the clean and efficient use of solid fuels: CARNOT (1998–2002)); and supports the Government's view that actions should be taken to promote a greater use of renewable energy within Europe, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, and that measures to promote renewables should be compatible with the need to restrain public expenditure and avoid disproportionate costs for consumers and industry; and supports the Government's view that EU spending programmes with an energy component should, as far as practicable, be brought together in a framework programme to improve co-ordination and transparency.</p></blockquote></p>
