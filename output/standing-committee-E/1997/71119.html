	<p>[	<i>Relevant document: SEC (97) 1954 final, the Letter of Amendment No. 1 to the preliminary draft budget of the European Communities for 1998</i>.]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that today's procedure is different from normal. Although the Minister will make an opening statement, I am sure that she will make it brief, and we shall then have an hour of questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The documents available for this debate are voluminous but some are missing. That is serious. We cannot proceed without all the relevant information. Seven volumes of the European Union budget are referred to in volume 1. Volume 2 concerns the expenditure of the European Parliament, but it is not available for this morning's debate. The Parliament's expenditure comes out of tax revenues that come from, among others, the British taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the Select Committee on European Legislation refers to the document, but states in brackets that it is not available. I suggest that we cannot proceed if an important document is not available. To do so is a breach of treaty law. A protocol under the treaty of Amsterdam guarantees that national Parliaments shall have an enhanced scrutiny role and that necessary documents
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall he promptly forwarded to national parliaments of the Member States."</p></blockquote>
In view of the fact that that has not been done in the present case and that a document that is referred to is not provided, I suggest that we should adjourn until the information is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Sayeed 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Bedfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The Committee is asked to take note of the European Community documents and to support the Government in maintaining budget discipline in the Community. I suggest that we cannot take note of a document that we do not have. We all know that there has been considerable corruption in the European Parliament. Unless we can examine its budget, which means we must look at that document, how can we take note?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The present discussion is an echo of a similar one that took place during our previous scrutiny debate in this Committee in July. The right
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) complains that volume 2 of the draft budget is missing from the documentation provided for the debate. Volume 2, which concerns the European Parliament's administrative expenses, is not published—so it cannot possibly be made available for this debate—because of agreement between the institutions that the Council of Ministers should not consider the budget of the European Parliament, which does not consider that of the Council of Ministers. It is bizarre, to say the least, that the right hon. Member for Wells, who, when he was in my position during his party's time in government, made the point that I am making, should have raised this point of order. It is not a valid point of order. He is just waffling to avoid dealing with the substantive issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am similarly astonished by the right hon. Gentleman's point of order. The Committee is having this unprecedented second debate because Opposition members on the Select Committee on European Legislation insisted that the matter be brought back for further consideration. In the light of that fact, is it credible or justifiable that the Opposition have not even tabled an amendment to make debate realistic and effective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip and Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will have noticed that the European Court of Auditors report was published yesterday and that extracts appeared in the press. Would it not be appropriate to adjourn until we can study that report? Press reports suggest that 5 per cent. of the previous year's budget was misappropriated, mis-spent and fraudulently applied. While these scandals are allowed to persist, should we not be able to reflect on the full recommendations rather than have to rely on bowdlerised extracts from the press?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Letwin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to make exactly the same point as my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The opportunity to question the Minister about the budget fraud reported in the newspapers is here right now. If Conservative Members stopped wasting time on points of order, which is what they did at the previous sitting and the one before that, we would all have more time to question the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always grateful to Members of Parliament for guidance. It is helpful to hear their views about how I should be running the Committee. The Committee is sitting on the basis of the documents that have been circulated. Luckily for me, it is not for the Chair to decide what should or should not be made available. I am sure that the Minister will have noted the views that have been expressed so far. We still have nearly an hour of questions so I suggest that we proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
I remind members of the Committee that questions must be brief and asked one at a time. I hope that speeches will be reserved for the second part of the Committee—otherwise the Chairman may have an odd word or two to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised a point of order about a missing document and you have dealt with that, Mrs. Dunwoody. However, my question about the European Court of Auditors is more serious than either the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) or even my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) recognises. It has been trailed in the press and the Treasury may have a copy of the relevant document, but neither the Vote Office nor the Library—I have just checked—has a copy. I contacted the Treasury which said that the Court of Auditors report had been placed in the Library, yet five minutes ago I ascertained that the only documentation available was a press notice downloaded from the Internet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document exists and is relevant to our debate. The House has not been provided, still less the Committee, with a copy. Since this situation is a breach of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I ask you, Mrs. Dunwoody, to adjourn our proceedings until we have the necessary documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been called together to examine the documents before the Committee. The provision of individual documents is not a matter for the Chair. I suggest that we proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee knows, I represented the United Kingdom at the Budget Council on 24 July. It was most successful from the United Kingdom's point of view. I agreed a reduction in provision for payments of 1.8 becu below the Commission's preliminary draft budget. That represents 1.13 per cent. of the Community's gross domestic product, compared with a limit of 1.26 per cent. set by the own resources decision. At only 0.7 per cent., the increase in payments over 1997 is well below the rate of inflation. I was also able to agree a reduction in the level of commitments by some 450 mecu from the Commission's proposals. That leaves a margin of 3.9 becu below the ceiling set by the financial perspectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to say that in a context of considerable budgetary rigour I successfully argued for continued funding of 100 mecu a year for the European Union's peace programme for Ireland. I am sure that the House will welcome the recognition by our European partners of the importance of the peace programme in Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will know that decisions of the Budget Council are strongly constrained by decisions taken in other Councils. For example, the key ingredients of the agriculture budget are set by the Agriculture Council when it decides how much aid to direct to farmers. The budget for structural funds
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
flows, almost inevitably, from decisions that were made during the negotiation of the Community's current financial perspectives in Edinburgh in 1992. I do not belittle the role of the Budget Council, but I emphasise the achievement of reaching agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament's amendments are also the subject of debate. The European Parliament plays an important role in setting the budget. As in previous years, the amendments for which the Parliament voted on 23 October increased the overall budget. I believe that the European Parliament was wrong to do that. To do it justice, it did not go as far as on previous occasions. However, that is not the end of the process. I intend to maintain pressure on my Council colleagues at next week's Budget Council meeting to ensure that we achieve the best possible outcome for the 1998 budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider the revenue part of the budget, which means the gross contributions that member states make. That was the subject of lengthy debate at the scrutiny meeting in July. The negotiation of the annual EC budget deals with the spending side of the budget; we do not negotiate its revenue aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Member states' contributions flow automatically from the formulae in existing Community law and mainly from the own resources decision, which dates from the Edinburgh agreement in 1992. United Kingdom contributions vary from year to year for technical reasons, which we discussed at the last scrutiny meeting. I have corresponded with hon. Members at length about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament's draft budget, which I shall consider at the Budget Council next week, does not revise the revenue provisions in the earlier drafts of the budget because it deals with expenditure. However, on the basis of the draft budget, the United Kingdom's gross contribution would be broadly that which we discussed in July. There is an increase of approximately 3 per cent. in our sterling payments for the calendar year 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important issue for the United Kingdom's national budget is the net contribution in future financial years. The Government made it clear that we are sticking to our predecessors' public expenditure plans, which include trended estimates for the UK's net contributions to the EC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no reason to suppose that the previous Government's estimates will be insufficient. That is not surprising given that the 1998 EC budget will probably be well below the limits to which the previous Government agreed at Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Economic Secretary about measures to combat fraud. Like the rest of us, the Minister may not have had the opportunity to read the European Court of Auditors report. There are reports in the press of nearly £3 billion of missing funds. In view of that, why is she presiding over a cut in anti-fraud expenditure in next year's European Union budget? That expenditure decreases to only 4.4 mecu. That is an infinitesimally small amount to spend on a truly alarming problem in view of the European Union's budget of 90 becu.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
We made that point when we debated the issue in July. Why has she not followed up her words with action and insisted on at least maintaining the expenditure on anti-fraud measures? The Government have apparently raised no objection to the cut in the anti-fraud expenditure budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have to handle the European budget with greater rigour because the previous Government got us into such a mess. I greatly regret that we cannot discuss the European Court of Auditors document on fraud and mismanagement in the Community, because it points to the failings of Conservative Members when they formed the Government. It deals with the previous Government's failure to tackle fraud properly. That Government voted against qualified majority voting for matters relating to fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Labour Government in the treaty of Amsterdam voted for increased powers to tackle fraud in the Community. I am surprised that the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), given his ministerial background, is not aware that cuts in antifraud expenditure are a national responsibility. If he wishes to take into account the nature of the EC expenditure on anti-fraud measures, he will find that it is for computers, training and all the administrative back-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effective way to deal with both fraud and mismanagement in the European Community is to have a Government who are committed to playing their part in the fight against fraud—not a Government like the previous one who were prepared to use the negotiations about bovine spongiform encephalopathy to frustrate the attempts of other member states to improve Community procedures. Already there has been considerable discussion in the Council of Ministers: Commissioners Liikanen and Gradin have already progressed far in their deliberations about how to handle fraud. It is quite shameful that we are facing a situation here today that is caused by the previous Government's inaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we go any further, I should remind the Committee that this is a question and answer session. I cautioned the Committee before and I shall do so again: I want brief questions, and it would be very helpful if we had brief answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Talking of fraud, is it not correct that the report highlighted expenditure that is unaccounted for? Clearly that reveals a level of incompetence, but it does not directly point to fraud—although there is some fraud involved. Is that not why the Amsterdam treaty was right to insist on greater powers for the European Court of Auditors and increased QMV in order to tackle the issue of fraud? Is it not therefore astonishing that those were the very measures that the Opposition voted against in the House last week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, Mrs. Dunwoody. I totally support the point that my hon. Friend has made. It is most apposite. Fraud and financial management is one of the key themes that Britain will pursue during our presidency of the EU next year. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
is one of the areas about which we have found grave concern since we took over from the previous Government. I repeat: the right hon. Member for Wells, who should have considerable knowledge of these matters, should know that the key money that must be expended on cutting back fraud comes from national budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister does not want her party to appear to be acquiescing to fraud, surely the way to address it is to cut off the funding. To take the structural funds to which she referred, year upon year we pay more and more to dubious recipients. Can she point to any convictions in the Commission or Parliament of the European Union or among the recipients of this largesse at our taxpayers' expense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate the point that I have just made. One of the responsibilities of this Government is to play a constructive role in Europe rather than adopt the yah-boo politics that we got from the previous Government. We work with our European partners, and indeed have many allies on this matter. Many countries are concerned about wasteful expenditure and inadequate targeting. Indeed, we have just had an example from the right hon. Member for Wells who does not seem to believe that expenditure should be specifically targeted and, in that way, be specific. Conservative Members cannot see the wood for the trees. They cannot address the real issues here because they are so divided on the issue of Europe. They give Pavlovian responses every time European issues are raised in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is striking that the whole budget overwhelmingly extends the entries for the previous year. There are relatively few items where the amount budgeted differs significantly from the amount budgeted the year before. Should not the Government draw on our experience with the current expenditure review and suggest to the EU that an exercise be carried out in the next year or two to review all the posts to see whether the priorities are still appropriate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You'll be lucky.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. I can tell the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) that the new atmosphere towards the United Kingdom in Brussels is already helping us quite considerably. It is inevitable that changes from one year to the next are not enormous. The budgets largely reflect the policy decisions that are taken by other councils. Even in national budgets, it is not possible to make large changes in distribution from one year to another. Significant issues will come up relating to Agenda 2000, to enlargement and also to policy changes that must proceed in parallel with enlargement. That will allow us a greater opportunity to focus expenditure. The press comments this morning on the European Court of Auditors report again underline our determination to ensure that budget headings are accurate and that they do not leave too much scope, as that could lead to flexibility in expenditure. My hon. Friend makes a valid point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to see the poacher turned gamekeeper, Mrs. Dunwoody, and it is even better when the gamekeeper becomes the proprietor—the position to which you have now been elevated. Hon. Members took note of your words of advice at the beginning of the sitting, and we will certainly follow the example that you set as a member of the Committee during the previous Government. Your insight and knowledge were much appreciated by myself and many other hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Get on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe in paying honour where it is due, and it should be be paid to the contributions that you made, Mrs. Dunwoody, and to the example that you set us in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a special interest in the 100 mecu, or whatever it is—I can never decide whether it is ecu or pounds— for the peace process in Ireland, although, after some of the events that took place in Northern Ireland last night, we might question whether much progress has been made in that area. What exactly is that money being spent on? Are the figures relating to its expenditure available to this Committee, or to any other Committee of the House?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been told that some of the money has been spent on the resettlement of terrorists after their release from prison, where they have served sentences for murder and other crimes. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether such people have been provided with money to purchase houses, to set themselves up in business, or to buy taxi cabs and so on? Given the use to which some taxi cabs have been put in Northern Ireland, there could be considerable fraud in that and other areas. Funds could be diverted to purposes of which the Committee would not approve. Will the Minister, therefore, give us a detailed explanation of the allocation of the money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I answer the hon. Gentleman's question, I should like to echo his gracious statements about you, Mrs. Dunwoody. It was remiss of me not to refer to your guidance and to your elevation in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the European Union's peace and reconciliation programme in Northern Ireland is to bring the communities together. The programme has attracted a high degree of local interest in Northern Ireland and in the border counties, and it has made a valuable contribution to the political process. The programme has been enthusiastically received within the Province, with 4,338 projects approved up to 31 March this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to show the people of Northern Ireland that there is a route out of the unfortunate situation there, through working together and through improving economic performance. I know Northern Ireland reasonably well, not only because I am a Scot, but through travelling there. The Government have also supported the programme by providing matching funding: up to £66 million has been made available, if required, during the first three years, to match the £200
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
million—that is 300 mecu—provided by the Commission. That is a substantial commitment by any standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The focusing of the money on specific projects is not a matter for the Committee, but for the authorities in Northern Ireland. It is for them to ensure that the money is spent to bring the communities together and to provide the socio-ecomomic background within which the peace process can take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister and other members of the Committee may recall that I have raised the matter of the common agricultural policy at previous meetings. It is the perverse effect of the CAP that leads to the substantial net contributions to the budget by the United Kingdom. I ask my hon. Friend to continue to press for reductions in agricultural spending, so that its proportion in the overall budget is reduced to the benefit of the United Kingdom in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that perceptive question on an issue about which the Government feel considerable anxiety. In our discussions in the Budget Council and the Agriculture Council, we shall exert strong pressure. I reiterate what I said about enlargement. Significant issues relating to the CAP must be seen in parallel with our discussions on enlargement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft budget shows that the United Kingdom's net contribution to CAP—this was specific expenditure—was 2.3 becu or £1.6 million below the guideline and was the same as in the 1997 budget. Unanimity is required to breach or to increase the guideline, and that puts us in a firm position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend: the CAP imposes unacceptable costs on taxpayers and consumers. Those costs remain much too high, and the Government are pressing the Commission to propose savings. Reforms to CAP mean that two thirds of spending is now paid directly to farmers compared with about one quarter before the reforms, and much less is being spent on surplus production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's point goes right to the heart of the debate about the future of the European Union. The issue is at the forefront of Ministers' minds, and will continue to be so during the negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has peppered her remarks with words like "new atmosphere" and "partnership". Persumably, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was the beneficiary of that when he met his colleagues to discuss Britain's participation on the committee to decide the format of the European currency unit. Therefore, the Minister may like to elaborate on the extent to which the Chancellor experienced a new atmosphere and was able to work in partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the question from the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) on agriculture policy, will the Minister tell us the criteria by which she believes the Government's effectiveness in obtaining reform of the CAP should be judged either during their presidency of European Union or beyond?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman refers to the ECOFIN discussions that took place on Monday at which no final decisions were made about any of the arrangements relating to the single currency. I say that with some authority because I was present at those discussions. I can testify to the new atmosphere that pervades at the Council tables. Indeed, that allows for a much more constructive debate, which is in Britain's best interests. We have considerable allies in Europe, and, after visiting a number of European capitals in the past few weeks, I have met unanimous approval for the statement that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer made in the House on 27 October when he put aside the previosu Government's fudge and brought Britain up to date in our discussions on the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the effectiveness of our negotiations on the reform of CAP, we have already made it clear that that will form a critical part of the discussions on enlargement. The Commission has come up with ideas for the CAP, and that is a step in the right direction. The Commission has suggested reducing price support and talked of limited decoupling payments from production and greater emphasis on the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
CAP reform has already been recognised as a United Kingdom priority. We want to work hand in hand with the Commission and with other member states in moving forward actively. We hope that the Commission will soon come forward with concrete legislative proposals so that negotiations in the Council can proceed rapidly. That is a mature way to proceed. It is better than shouting "ya-boo" from sidelines, as had occurred for the past 18 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last time that we debated the European Union budget and considered the preliminary draft budget Conservative Members told the Minister that she was weak, that a coach and horses would be driven through our proposals, and that she would not win any concessions in her negotiations. As the Minister has come back with concessions that she did not even tell us she was aiming to obtain at the time, I wondered whether any Conservative Members have been man enough to apologise to her and to offer her their congratulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I mean it seriously—we have an hour for questions. I hope that questions will be brief and refer to the matters we are considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was struck by the admirable way in which the Minister referred earlier to the necessity for accuracy in the budget headings. Could she therefore comment on what appears on page 14 of the explanatory memorandum, which describes "lump-sum budgeting" for the central institutions? I am not familiar with that phrase and I wonder whether the Minister can explain it, and say whether, within the lump-sum budgeting to be introduced, any expenditure is foreseen for promoting the euro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer briefly to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman). I assume that instead of offering me their congratulations, the Opposition have simply
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
decided not to table an amendment for discussion this morning. I do not assume that they are so inefficient that they could not get their act together to table an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had many discussions with the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) and I have had an extensive correspondence with him. Some of his questions were so arcane that it was a job to work out exactly what he was asking. He talks about expenditure on the euro. The Chancellor made it clear on 27 October that we will seek support from the European Commission for an information campaign to encourage a necessary public debate in this country about something as significant as the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have written to the European Commission asking for financial assistance for the document, published in July, relating to advice for businesses on issues that they need to take into account in respect of a single currency—whether we are in or out. As the Minister with responsibility for financial services, I am well aware that whether we are in or out of a single currency, any company in this country that trades must be prepared for it. As a prudent Government who are committed to democratic debate we must seek what opportunities we can to obtain additional funds for an information campaign, not a political campaign. We want companies in the United Kingdom to start on a more even playing field than they had before because of the inadequacies of the previous Government's position on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question concerns tobacco. I have tabled a series of questions on this subject, which I pursued with the previous Government, so I hope that the hon. Lady will not suggest that it is all our fault. I understand that the Government will spend some £20 million on the Health Education Authority to try to prevent people smoking, yet the common agricultural policy will give 1 billion ecu to the growing of sub-standard tobacco in southern states, much of which is then involved in fraud—it is shipped to Albania and given an export subsidy. That is money from the British taxpayer. The Minister will have my congratulations if she secures the problem. How can she stand by her Government's commitment to ban tobacco advertising and sponsorship—except for formula one, of course—and yet condone the spending of British taxpayers' money on the growing of tobacco?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, I must confess, raises a serious matter. I am very concerned about it and so are the Government. The treaty provides for agricultural production, including tobacco, to be eligible for support under the CAP, and the Government continue to register their concern about the substantial cost of the regime and the high level of support for the tobacco regime compared with other crops. The cost is substantial: it is 1 billion ecu, about 2.5 per cent. of the total cost of the CAP. In 1992 there was a reform that capped that expenditure. In 1995 expenditure on tobacco was 993 million ecu. We will press for reduced suppport to match plans to get better returns from the market. Some schemes to encourage
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
producers to leave tobacco production may require some short-term continuation of aid in the from of decoupled expenditure to achieve long-term reductions in support. The issue is at the front of our mind but it is not easy to resolve. Continuing pressure is necessary, and it will continue to be applied by the United Kingdom Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make no apology for returning to the subject of fraud. Will the Minister confirm first, that the Court of Auditors report refers to the European Union budget for 1996—at which time the Conservatives were in charge—and does she agree that we need no lessons from the Conservatives on how to tackle fraud? Secondly, does not the report, rather than their continual rhetoric and blather, represent the reality of the Conservatives policy. Thirdly, will the Minister say a little more about the reason for fraud in the budget and perhaps take the opportunity to describe how we shall use our presidency of the EU in the forthcoming year to take a genuine lead in tackling fraud?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. From my reading of the Court of Auditors report, I observe that it is a most valuable tool to use to highlight how the previous Government—[HoN. MEMBERS: "Why do we not have it?"] Hon. Members keep asking from a sedentary position why we do not have the report. I will tell them. The report was published yesterday and put in the Library of the House of Commons this morning in the usual way. I would be delighted to have it on the table today because it would provide a good opportunity to expose the Conservatives' inadequacies in tackling fraud. We now hear hypocritical nonsense from the Opposition, who failed in these matters when in government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to make full use of the EU presidency next year to push forward an active agenda to deal with fraud and waste. When I reported yesterday on the publication of the Court of Auditors report, of which I had seen a summary, I stressed how disturbing reading it has been. It makes good sense to use our tenure to show that the fight against fraud is a key priority of our presidency of the EU. It is interesting that within weeks of being elected this was one of the issues at the Amsterdam summit on which we achieved substantial progress—which, I have to say, could have been achieved by the previous Government had they not tried to look in 14 directions at once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it a point of order or a question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a point of order. I am sure that the Minister did not intend to mislead the Committee, but she has just done so. Five minutes before the sitting began I checked the Library of the House, the International Desk, the European Affairs Desk and the Front Desk, and all categorically denied having received a copy of the document. The hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Lady has, I am sure inadvertently, merely assumed that a copy was put in the Library, but that is not so, and it is best to put it on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman, who made that point earlier, and I dealt with it then. Does he wish to ask the Minister a question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Mrs. Dunwoody, probably have the responsibility of ensuring—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that I should make clear the division of responsibilities in the Committee. I deal with my bit, others deal with their bits. I am not responsible for the provision of documents. The Minister has made it clear that she thought the document had been put in the Library; the right hon. Gentleman asserts that it was not. Luckily, I am not in the position of having to take a judicial role in the matter. I asked whether the right hon. Gentleman wished to ask the Minister a question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do have another question, not a point of order, which I am sure will come as a relief to you, Mrs. Dunwoody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seldom relieved by the activities of various Committees of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that elucidation, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question relates to B5-305, on page 59 of the explanatory memorandum, which concerns strategic implementing measures. I note a substantial increase in projected commitments for a strategy to adopt an
	<br><blockquote><p>"action programme for the reinforcement of the indirect taxation systems of the internal market."</p></blockquote>
I also note that the European Parliament is urging further expenditure
	<br><blockquote><p>"to cover the costs of establishing a forum for indirect taxation … to clarify the European Union's philosophy towards indirect taxation."</p></blockquote>
Does the hon. Lady agree that issues of indirect taxation fall to national Parliaments, and that no such directive has been passed authorising this expenditure? Will she therefore raise at next week's meeting of the Budget Council the fact that this exceeds the powers of the Commission and the European Union institutions, and seek to delete both the original expenditure and in particular the additional measures proposed by the European Parliament, which has no responsibilities in this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall write to the right hon. Gentleman about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that she will continue to strive to ensure that all the Community's expenditure is authorised and has a legal base? I was astonished, as I am sure many hon. Members were, to read in the report of the Select Committee on European Legislation that the Council had to delete some expenditure from the proposal because it had no legal base and was not authorised expenditure. May I congratulate the Minister on the deletion by the Council, and will she confirm that she will continue her efforts as regards the legal base?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can confirm that. We take most seriously the issue of the legal base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister congratulated herself on the modesty of the proposed budget. If the European Parliament proposes significant additions to it, will she oppose the draft budget at the meeting on 27th November?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not given to self-congratulation, as the hon. Gentleman may know. I have a responsibility to come and tell the Committee how I fared in the negotiations. It would be silly of me not to point to the considerable advances that Britain was able to make there. As the Council of Ministers represents Europe's taxpayers, I will of course take an extremely strong line there. When I was at ECOFIN on Monday, I had discussions with other members of the EU on the attitude that we would adopt to the European Parliament. The Parliament can go against the Council's budget, but it is important for the Council to give a moral lead. I shall make that point most forcefully to Members of the European Parliament who will joint the Budget Council on 27 November.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I apologise for being out of the Committee when this matter was raised. It was claimed that the Court of Auditors report was not in the Library. I have just obtained a copy; it has been on the Internet all morning. If the right hon. Member for Wells had been more diligent in his research, he would have got it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I think that both sides of the Committee have made their points.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the best way to get results in all European negotiations is to win friends and influence people rather than to shout abuse, as the Opposition seem to prefer? Is she working with like-minded states to achieve budget discipline and reduce waste in the EU?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree with my hon. Friend, it is important to be constructive in these matters. It is a sign of maturity because one can always achieve much more in discussions by being constructive than by pursuing the rather negative policies of the previous Government, who were much more interested in trying to score domestic points among their own Back Benchers than in representing Britain's best interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and most members of the Committee know, I own a farm and earned my living in that calling before entering the House. I have always been concerned that farming, if it is to be profitable, needs so much subsidy. Can the Minister explain the rationale behind increasing provision for arable crops, given the continuing problems that this country has with BSE? Can she also explain the reasons for increases in the subsidy on
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
tobacco, given that we have a high tax on tobacco and that we are well aware that large quantities of the handrolling tobacco produced in Northern Ireland are exported to the continent and reappear illegally on various stalls in the United Kingdom within a fortnight? Some three quarters of handrolling tobacco is now illegal. Surely, pouring extra money into growing tobacco will lower its price on the market, thereby increasing the gap between our taxed tobacco and tobacco produced elsewhere. The Government should be opposing tooth and nail the proposal to increase subsidies for the growing of tobacco in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite simply, the United Kingdom did oppose increases in the subsidy for arable crops. The majority of member states at the Agricultural Council in June strongly opposed us: onlys the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark argued against increases in subsidies, so no decisions were taken. The hon. Member for East Londonderry is concerned about tobacco, but in response to his substantive point about arable crops, I repeat that we have opposed those increases in subsidies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The hon. Member for East Londonderry suggested that there has been an increase in the budget for tobacco; but so far as I can tell, there has been a decrease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. If we continue wasting out time with spurious points of order, we shall get nowhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note from the documents before us that major items of expenditure are of direct benefit to the British people. Expenditure on making Chernobyl safe is a good example. Would the Minister like to comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend has raised that point because our scrutiny too often highlights only the negative aspects of the Community budget. It is important to acknowledge that sort of spending to which he refers, spending is a significant aspect of the budget. We will continue to pursue such environmental matters since the role of the environment will play an important part in discussions about enlargement. As we enter the Agenda 2000 process, we have the opportunity to debate critical environmental issues affecting applicant states. We have seen in relation to Chernobyl how the Community members can work together to address serious issues—tragedy and suffering as well as the environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me if I appear to return to the starting point, but I revert to chapter B1-17 on tobacco. If the Government are keen to ensure that European assistance will not be prejudiced by cigarette consumption, would it not be honest to abate our contribution towards the £975,000 that is, effectively spent on killing people? If we were to abate our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
contribution, would it not make a stronger point than any vote, which can be nullified under the qualified majority voting system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be illegal to proceed with abatement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pursuing the point raised by the hon. Member for East Londonderry about additional spending on arable crops. Paragraph 1.7 of the Treasury document at the front of our bundle of documents—it relates to document 10153—refers to precise figures. It suggests that, following the decision of the Agriculture Council to raise spending on arable, the money will be recouped by cutting other budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a per capita basis, it appears that Britain would receive another £140 million of additional spending on arable, but I suspect that we will receive very little indeed. I would like to ask the Minister—I do not expect an answer at this stage, but a promise of an answer later in writing would be helpful—about the precise effects of that substantial shift within the agricultural budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly write to the hon. Gentleman on those matters, but perhaps I can enlarge slightly on the points about arable crops. The Government's position is outlined in the letter of amendment. As I explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated on Friday, the UK intends to seek further cuts in the agriculture budget in the light of those forecasts. We think that that is justified by the across-the-board cut that the Council imposed in July and which the Commissioners propose should be offset by forecasting changes. It is further justified by the significant underspends in the current budget year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We return to the issue of underspends each year, when we look at the way the budget is constructed. There is too big a margin for underspending; year after year, issues come back where there are substantial underspends. Frankly, having an area where there is scope for eat-up in the margin is not an acceptable way to budget. That is an issue that we are pursuing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to line B3-300 and to the fact that it should probably be called propaganda rather than the grandiose title that it gives itself, but more specifically, to the fact that it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The EU's information and communication policy must take duly into account the differing views and philosophies with regard to the European integration process."</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister agree with that statement and if so would she use her best endeavours to ensure that whatever propaganda is pumped out by the European Union, to the tune of £27 million in the budget, it will include an equal view of what I shall broadly characterise as Euro-scepticism based not least on the referendum results in Denmark and France?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is rubbish. The right hon. Gentleman is trailing his coat here. Any democratic Government would believe in ensuring that adequate factual information is available to its members. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
a view that the United Kingdom Government take. The fever of Euro-scepticism is gripping Conservative Members. This is the European Parliament's amendment to the budget. The Council has not agreed to this, but it is important, in particular in relation to integration and to the completion of the single market, that adequate information is made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, it has become glaringly obvious from our discussions with business people in the past few months, that they are fed up with the way the previous Government tried to put a spin on all European information. People want digestible facts. They do not want the information wrapped up in some of the propaganda exercises that we hear from Conservative Members, who are not using the scrutiny process for its proper purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a new Member of Parliament, I am very conscious of the ghosts of centuries who go before us. I had a look at the report of the debate on 10 July 1996, when positions were slightly different. The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), the then Paymaster General, declared that he was happy that the new Commission was giving fraud the attention that it deserved. Is there not a contradiction? Conservative Members are so dissatisfied with the actions against fraud this year, whereas they were apparently supinely satisfied with them last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The previous Government were supine on these matters because their eye was off the ball. Whenever issues such as fraud were being discussed, an alternative agenda was being pursued, not merely in relation to the bizarre position adopted on BSE, but because of the schisms that were apparent within the Conservative party. Fraud should be dealt with constructively. This Government, who have been in office for only seven months, have already taken action on that and shown up the inadequacies of the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for asking her to answer the first part of the question that I asked, but I would genuinely like to understand what lump sum funding is. By now, the hon. Lady has had time to receive advice from her advisers and it would be helpful to understand that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to go into that in greater detail in my reply, but I will deal with it now. Lump-sum budgeting is top-down budgeting, part of sound and efficient management 2000, which is the programme on efficiency management of Community resources. It is a new system that provides for more delegation and increases responsibility and accountability. That leads to better governance. It is a good system.

I have already met Commissioners Liikanen and Gradin to give our support to the programme and it is an issue in which the Government will continue to take an interest. Like the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), I am concerned about how the budget is

constructed because it does not lead to the efficiency that we want. SEM 2000 is a means of achieving efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The draft budget derives from the Edinburgh settlement. Does my hon. Friend recall that, when debating the Bill ratifying the outcome of the Edinburgh summit, the then Paymaster General, now the shadow Chief Secretary, the right hon. Member for Wells, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By 1999, the adjustment to the contribution ceiling contained in the Bill will cost each person in this country about 7p a week at today's prices … I ask the House to keep a sense of proportion".—[	<i>Official Report</i>, 28 November 1994; Vol. 250, c. 1024.]</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister tell us whether she detects a sense of proportion in this debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The extent to which the right hon. Member for Wells has stood on his head in this debate and in the previous one is very interesting. Some of the best quotes I employed in the previous debate—a new one has now been provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)—came from the lips of the right hon. Member for Wells. To pay tribute to him, I could not have put it better myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return the Economic Secretary to agriculture expenditure. As compulsory expenditure, it falls very much within the remit of the Council, so she can do something about it. I draw her attention to budget line B2-5122 entitled "Enhancing public awareness of the common agricultural policy". Does she think that it is right that 5.5 million ecu should be spent on, among other things, financing the Rural Women's Union and the European Rural Women's congress to be held in Berlin? Money has also been spent on setting up a rural counselling service and a helpline for the farming profession. Farmers in my constituency do not wish to take part in a rural counselling service, particularly when it is funded by their money once it has been filtered through Brussels. What is her attitude towards such expenditure, especially as she has professed her concern at the size of the CAP?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. McNulty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not indicating that I wished to intervene at this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Rammell.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm that during the current financial year Britain's net contribution to European Community institutions will be £1.4 billion, which represents 1 per cent. of British public expenditure. Is any other 1 per cent. of British public expenditure given as much scrutiny as that 1 per cent. contribution? Is it not unprecedented for the Committee to have a second debate on the European Union budget and our contribution to it? Therefore, is it not astonishing that the Opposition have not tabled an amendment, especially as they insisted on this debate in the Select Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome scrutiny of the Community budget. That is an important process. However, I deplore it when people play games with the scrutiny process. We are engaged in an important procedure and it is regrettable that it is used to play games. Like others, I would like to improve the scrutiny process, but to do that we would need to see signs of greater maturity in Conservative Members. They use this Committee to fight their own battles within the Conservative party and not to subject the budget to the scrutiny that it merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will excuse me from many of the ills that she attributes to the previous Government. I also hope that she will keep to her words and that the Government will provide us with digestible facts. Therefore, will she give us a list of those budget lines for which there is no legal base? Will she also tell us whether any moneys have been spent on those items in previous years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is offended because I lump him in with Conservative Members. He has supported Conservative Members on several such issues in the past. However, I shall write to him about his specific point on budget lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the agricultural budget, which accounts for such a large part of the money that has been spent. In the light of the report on fraud, will the Minister confirm that she will examine subsidies carefully? There is no flexibility in those subsidies. Even when the world price rises, farmers continue to receive a subsidy, despite being able to get a better market price for their crops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point, which is echoed by other hon. Members from sedentary positions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are opportunities to examine the common agricultural policy. We must do that, and, in a more domestic context, ensure that the Community's agricultural policy takes the needs of consumers into account, and is not so biased towards the needs of farmers. I acknowledge the importance of the agricultural industry in our country. However, in my off-duty hours, I am a housewife. Hon. Members of both genders acknowledge that lower food prices would be beneficial to the country. That is a key element in the Government's attitude to the common agricultural policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt the Minister's good intentions, or the naive, misplaced optimism of the 10 out of 12 Labour Members on the Committee who have entered the House since 1992, when I was elected. However, I want to return to tobacco. It is all very well winning friends, being greeted in the capitals of Europe and registering opposition, but the previous Government did that, and, unfortunately, it achieved nothing. That encapsulates the problems with the budget. You can press as much as you like, but you get nowhere unless you take firm action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not pressing anyone to go anywhere at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concrete action will the Minister take to stop British taxpayers' money being wasted on a damaging crop? When will she come to the House and say that the Government have stopped that outrage? What guarantee can she provide that, in four years' time, in the dying days of the Labour Government, she will be able to say, "At least we prevented taxpayers' money from being spent on growing tobacco"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us who have not been Members of Parliament since 1992 have more of a nodding acquaintance with the real world than some Conservative Members. The tobacco line is decided by the Agriculture Council, not the Budget Council. We will vote against it. Agenda 2000 relates to enlargement and we will press, in parallel, for policy reforms. Opportunities exist to reform the common agricultural policy. I will be interested to witness the hon. Gentleman's part in debates about Agenda 2000. There would have been more point in discussing such matters in detail than in coat trailing by Eurosceptic Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. McNulty if he has his second breath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened to many questions from Conservative Members, some of which were germane to the scrutiny of the budget. Could not all the questions have been asked in July? Why are we having a second pop?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should not have got his breath back. No hon. Member on this Committee asks a question that is not in order without the Chair taking an interest. All the previous questions were in order. The Minister has nothing to answer on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What proportion of the budget allocated to cereal producers is devoted to set-aside? Does the Minister realise that it is an affront to the British people that acres are deliberately left fallow and not used for cultivation when half the world is starving?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to repeat myself, and I alluded to that matter when I replied to the point of the hon. Member for East Londonderry about arable crops. I had notes in front of me then, but there is such a tree of paper here that I cannot find them now. I share anxieties about the structure of the budget and set-aside. We want an agricultural policy that takes into account the cost to the consumer, who should be at the fore front of our mind in such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to focus for a moment not on the massive, macro budget decisions but on some smaller decisions. Will the Minister try, in the relevant discussions, to ensure continued attention to the campaign against sex tourism and work relating to the environment and developing countries? Those matters are a small but important element in the budget process, and I should like the Minister to keep an eye on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point, which emphasises the strength that can be derived from working with our European partners on issues of common concern. A cross-European attitude to the matters that my hon. Friend mentioned and shared revulsion at certain things, are important elements of our armour. I shall take his advice and examine closely those aspects of the budget that relate to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The draft budget has expenditure lines for culture, sport and tourism. Does the Minister think that they breach the principle of subsidiarity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see that they necessarily breach the principle. Overarching responsibilities for aspects of the matters that the hon. Gentleman mentioned relate to member states. However, we consider such matters closely. I am part of a Government who think of subsidiarity as not just a word but part of policy development, and who have given subsidiarity in democracy its greatest effectiveness yet with devolution referendums in Scotland and Wales. The Government believe in subsidiarity and will promote it for the next five years in the European Union and in the domestic constitution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the proposed increases written into the budget by the European Parliament? Does she believe that, following the Amsterdam treaty, increased scrutiny powers for the European Parliament will encourage it to reduce projected budgetary expenditures or, as it appears, will it continue to try to increase them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had referred to that issue in my opening remarks. I am not happy with the increases proposed by the European Parliament, but the proposed increases were even greater in previous years. I will continue to take a robust view at the Budget Council on 27 November.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That brings us to the end of the time allotted for questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 10153/97, the draft general budget of the European Communities for 1998, and PE262.699, the European Parliament's proposed amendments to the draft general budget of the European Communities for 1998; and supports the Government's efforts to maintain budget discipline in the Community.—[	<i>Mrs. Liddell</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The Minister has several times this morning referred to the hon. Member for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wells.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we may sometimes mix up our cathedral cities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.39 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I now speaking to the motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, otherwise the right hon. Gentleman will be hearing from me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) who asked about the hon. Member for Wales, I think that that is me. Regrettably, we lack seats in that nation, but we shall put that right later. I represent the city of Wells and all its surrounding farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not dwell on the black documents except in the context of explaining why we shall vote against the motion and why it was not necessary to table an amendment. The motion refers to taking note of the draft general budget. On page 4 of the first volume there is a description of what is in volume 2—so we know that it exists. It is about the European Parliament's revenue and expenditure and about expenditure on the European Parliament ombudsman. As the document is not available, it is impossible for the Committee to take note of it. For those reasons and because we have no faith in the Government's ability to enforce budgetary discipline, we shall vote against the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman is aware that the documents before us include the budgetary appropriation for the European Parliament and that the amount covered is less than 2 per cent. of the total. Does he really want to make this matter one of his two substantive objections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I certainly do. It may be a small amount of money, but waste, ineffiency and corruption have even begun to disturb the European Parliament itself. It has investigated the matter and there have been some prominent examples in the national press—journeys are claimed for which were not undertaken and subsistence allowances paid regardless of whether the individual concerned actually attends on the day in question. It is of great interest to the House how British taxpayers' money is spent. I was surprised when the Minister suggested that the subject was somehow outside our remit and that, due to some gentleman's agreement, we were not able to scrutinise that aspect of public expenditure. I ask the hon. Lady to confirm whether that is her view, especially as her Government signed the Amsterdam treaty, which makes an explicit promise that the role of national Parliaments should be enhanced. The protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union states that its object is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to encourage greater involvement of national parliaments in the activities of the European Union and to enhance their ability to express their views on matters which may be of particular interest to them."</p></blockquote>
It promises the provision of documents in a timely fashion and in advance of debates. That is treaty law; it overrides anything that this House may decide to the contrary. When the Government sign up to something in Europe, I wish that they would take their actions more seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not refer again to the European Court of Auditors' report because we will debate that on another occasion. I repeat, the entire episode about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
documents shows the increasing contempt with which the Government appear to treat the House and the Committee. The 1998 draft budget and the Select Committee's observations are badly photocopied—lines are missing from the tops of pages and there is an apparent duplication of one page. Of course, by cross-referencing to other documents one can get to the bottom of what the Government are trying to put before the Committee, but the whole thing is very sloppy. In view of what happened in our previous debate, the Minister should ask herself how the Committee can make intelligent and timely contributions about the important matter of public expenditure when the documents are in disarray.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I hearing the right hon. Gentleman properly? We are in this Committee to discuss the budgetary scrutiny of a very important part of the United Kingdom's external relations and the right hon. Gentleman is obsessed with the quality of photocopying! Is that how he represents the views of the people who elected him and his hon. Friends to Parliament? That is a travesty—an example of an Opposition who do not know how to oppose and who could not even get their act together to table an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will regret that remark. The Speaker, in a letter to me, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I agree that documentation for European debates should be available in sufficient time to enable Members to study it before Committees meet."</p></blockquote>
After our debate, I shall give the hon. Lady the document that I have in mind, the top line of which is completely unreadable. That may be unimportant to the hon. Lady—she has access to 1,000 civil servants in her Department, who can give her all sorts of information, beautifully typed and presented in well-bound folders. Members of the Committee have to deal with the documents that are presented to them, often at quite short notice. The fact that the top line of a page is unreadable reflects badly on the care that the Minister should take to ensure that the Amsterdam treaty on informing national Parliaments is met to the letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before leaving that matter, I should like to remind the Committee that comments about the preparation of documents have been made at our two previous sittings. This Government inherited the scrutiny system from the previous Government, yet, after the Committee's comments, hon. Members have seen significant improvements in the provision of documents. Members of the Committee will know that we already have the documents for our next sitting. The Government have made progress in improving the scrutiny process in a very short time. Will the right hon. Member for Wells at least acknowledge that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman was not a Member during the previous Parliament. I do not understand, therefore, how he can compare the provision of documents now with what was provided at that time. I do not say that everything
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
that I did was blameless when I was in a similar position to the Minister, but I do say that I regard the Committee as an important part of the scrutiny process—as I always did, and as do the Government, because they agreed to the conditions of the Amsterdam treaty. I merely wished to point out that when there are deficiencies in that process, the Minister must take them seriously and should correct them. I shall leave the matter at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response to our questions about antifraud measures was inadequate. She said that most European Union expenditure takes place in member states. That might be true, but the European Commission estimates that about 15 per cent. of the 90 becu is directly under its control. That is a budget of 13 becu. Spending on anti-fraud measures, according to the documents before us, is being cut to 4.4 mecu. That will represent only 0.03 per cent. of the expenditure that the Commission is trying to control. Even allowing for the Minister's point—that much of the expenditure takes place in member states—the anti-fraud expenditure is miniscule and it is dropping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contrast anti-fraud expenditure with other budget headings under which spending is increasing. Next year, the cohesion fund will increase by nearly 14 per cent; expenditure on trans-European networks will increase by 26 per cent; and international fisheries agreements will increase by more than 20 per cent. Those areas are notorious for waste, fraud and corruption, yet the tiny amount—4.4 mecu—allocated to anti-fraud measures is a reduction from last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must return to that point and must take responsibility for her actions. She is now a Minister, she has a vote, she has a voice and she can raise such matters at Budget Councils and elsewhere. She can get something done, rather than saying that it is all the fault of national Governments, or all the fault of the previous UK Government. She should look ahead and at least try to retain that small budget item when some of the others are increasing so dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of my hon. Friends mentioned tobacco. The Government have already broken their election promise to ban tobacco sponsorship. I hope that that does not signal a softer attitude towards that budget line. It is still a scandal that nearly a billion ecu are being spent to subsidise that crop. The tobacco grown is completely unsuitable for the cigarettes we tend to smoke in this country, it is highly carcinogenic—most of it is probably burnt or dumped on third world countries—and, gives cancer to those who do smoke it, so there is a contradiction in the aims of the EU here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last Government raised that matter. I raised it personally in the General Affairs Council on a number of occasions. We pressed for it to be reviewed and I asked for it to be eliminated completely. There is no evidence that the Government have the same attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the hon. Gentleman's comments on the problems of tobacco production, what does he think about the fact
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
that the former Chancellor of the Exchequer is a director of a tobacco company? Is that not inconsistent with the view that he is putting forward?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. There is no connection between what my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), does in business and the fact that nearly a billion ecu of our money and that of the hon. Gentleman's constituents, is spent in the EU budget on growing extremely unpleasant tobacco.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice a somewhat cavalier attitude on the Government Benches to this debate and the expenditure. I think it was the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell) who said that this is only 1 per cent. of the national budget, so why are we scrutinising it so closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will do so gladly when I have made this point. I must remind the Committee that our gross net contributions fluctuate markedly, but if one takes the average of the past four years, our gross contribution to the EU budget is £6.5 billion, which runs at nearly £18 million a day. The net contribution—the difference between what we pay in and what we get back—over the past four years is still running at an average of £2.5 billion a year, which is very nearly £7 million a day. These are not de minimis. They are important items of the national account and it is part of our duties as elected Members of Parliament to look carefully at whether they are being misapplied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that it was a quite extraordinary implication in the intervention to which he referred that the Committee should concern itself only with the net contribution, as the UK taxpayer is responsible for the entire gross contribution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We pay an average of £6.5 billion, but the amounts that come back run things like industrial and social policies, over which we often have no direct control because they come out of majority voting. The research development budget is a very good example: the Government have now given away unanimity requirements on this, so we could have programmes being financed in this country against our vote in the EU but paid entirely disproportionately by British taxpayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want to interrupt the right hon. Gentleman but there is a reason why we address the Chair in these Committees. It is first, to have our words recorded and secondly as a matter of courtesy to the House. I would be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman could address the Chair. While I am on my feet, perhaps I can also remind hon. Members that the only "you" in the Committee is me. So I hope that hon. Members will stop addressing me about problems for which, luckily, other people have responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I will reorient myself towards the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am so glad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is evidence of big Government at work here and getting bigger. I would like the Minister to comment on the fact that if one tots up the number of consultative committees that are being funded out of the budget—both those that have to be consulted and the smaller number where consultation is not compulsory but common—it comes to a staggering 451. That many committees are being funded—they are consultative, they meet, they are serviced, people attending them presumably draw a subsistence and travel allowances, and so forth. That figure represents a significant growth against which national Parliaments and national Governments attending Budget Councils need to exert a countervailing pressure to prune the over-government that is so apparent in volume 4 of the draft general budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister seek to delete all the European Parliament amendments to the budget? The European Parliament is an expenditure organisation, which has increased the size of the budget. In the explanatory memorandum, the hon. Lady says that the Government will press for a budget closer to the level of the Council's draft budget position. We regard that aim as not ambitious enough. If the amendments are wrong, extravagant or go beyond what is acceptable in this country, they must all be deleted. I therefore ask whether the Minister will be speaking and voting accordingly at the Budget Council meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I have a request for the Minister. I know how difficult her job can be—grappling with the technicalities of a vast budget—so I do not expect a reply immediately. However, it would be helpful to the Committee and the House more widely to receive a calculation of the gross and net contributions into and out of the European Union budget for all member states. That would illustrate our relative position among other member states, some of which are great net beneficiaries and consequently less interested in budgetary discipline than we are.

When I was in government I raised that matter at Council meetings and the Commission was notoriously reluctant to provide information about national contributions—that was felt to be non-communautaire. We occasionally had the support of the Germans, but to the best of my knowledge when I left those matters no reliable information was available from the Commission. Such statistics as we could assemble came from the European Court of Auditors report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to publish an estimate so that we can get a feel for what members states are paying—not just for now but projected at least as far as 1999. Payments into the European budget are easier to calculate than payments out, which depend on the future of cohesion and structural funding. Nevertheless, reliable estimates can be made. If the Minister could provide this information about
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
member states, it would save me having to table so many written parliamentary questions. We know what the projections are for this country but it is difficult to get them from other states for an overall picture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Would the hon. Gentleman extend his request to cover all of those bodies? I would be interested in those figures; the last comprehensive figures for the United Kingdom date from the 1970s—under the former Labour Government, not one of which the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder how the hon.

I remind him that these proceedings are carried out by majority vote, so it is not possible for the United Kingdom to veto any one item or the overall budget. I assure him that the points that I have criticised in this debate were raised by me in Budget Councils and, in a previous job, in General Affairs Councils.

The latter, taken alone, are fairly meaningless; it is the net position that is significant. If we pay in £10 billion and get back £12 billion, that is bliss; if we pay in £10 billion and get back £8 billion, that is a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a most important point. Will he clarify his attitude to the opportunity cost that the British gross contribution represents? Is this money not extracted from our country and taken from plans, projects and expenditures that our electorate might prefer over the discretionary spendings that are approved by the European Union for counterspending, which reduces our gross contribution to the net figure to which the hon. Gentleman alluded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to a point which the hon. Gentleman may agree—what the money is spent on and the benefits that it brings are the most important thing. Problems with the budget are not specific this year but are general and ongoing, and our Government are addressing them. The problem is the common agriculture policy and the fact that we subsidise agriculture excessively when we could get cheaper food in other ways—and spend rather more on developing industry and perhaps other services which would be economically beneficial to living standards throughout the EU. That is just a general point, but it is one reason why I continually emphasise the problem of the CAP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to know what the trends are. I hope that, in time, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will be able to enlighten us about the precise trends in benefits and disbenifits in the budget payments and receipts to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The budget should do three things. First, it should be equitable between the member states and regions of the union. This is important in that poorer countries should receive more and richer countries should give more. Secondly, it should promote higher living standards, economic growth and employment within, and to the benefit of, the whole European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, and again importantly, the budget should help to produce economic convergence between the member states and regions within the European Community. The problem with the budget is that it does not achieve that, and the Government are dealing with the problem—perhaps indirectly—by emphasising the importance of fundamental reform of the CAP. The CAP is the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary mentioned the impact of the CAP on family food budgets. The Consumers Association and others have carried out research over the years that demonstrates that an average family pay about £1,000 extra a year on food simply as a result of high food prices in the European Union. Those high prices are a consequence of the CAP. That is not to say that some form of agricultural subsidy should not be paid, because the industry would not survive without it. However, the way and the exent to which agriculture is subsidised is something that the Government will have to consider in the coming years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worry that some developments will cause problems in the future. Enlargement will have a major impact on the budget. Countries joining the Union will, by and large, be poorer countries. We are a middling country in terms of our living standards, but we could become
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
richer relative to the average if poorer countries join. Therefore, we may pay proportionately rather more than we do at the moment, and we are not being treated equitably now. Getting it right before enlargement is very important. The agricultural budget will not be viable in its present form after enlargement. The incoming countries have large agricultural sectors and they are relatively poor. On the present basis, the CAP would not be sustainable. Therefore, we must look at reforming it urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Structural funds are another element in the budget. When Britian joined the European Economic Community, as it then was, we insisted on the introduction of regionsl spending. Before then, there was no regional spending. Britains's entry into the Community led to the development of regional spending. That has been beneficial, and structural funds are important for this country and a number of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worrying that, as some Labour Members of the European Parliament have recently reported, some countries—for example, Germany, and especially its region of Bavaria—are not overkeen on perpetuating regional spending and structural funds. They would like to see them wither. The Government must consider that problem, because such funds are important and will remain so in the foreseeable future if we are to achieve economic convergence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Economic convergence in terms of living standards, economic growth and employment is fundamental if the European Union is to survive in the long term. If it is not seen as equitable and does not appear to bring countries, living standards and people together, it will face problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman uses the term "convergence", which is very much in vogue, does he think that countries must rise to the general level of the best, or does he think that convergence could mean that one, two or more countries will have to see a fall in their per capita gross domestic product so that they converge at a midpoint? That is a crucial point, and it is one of the reasons why some of us oppose enlargement. We fear that people in this country will have to experience a significant real cut in their living standards so that they can worship at the idol of convergence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that I am talking about convergence in the context of overall growth. Even the richer countries, I hope, will continue to grow strongly and have healthy economies. Convergence is a way of helping poorer nations in Europe to grow more quickly, and, in time, of achieving a progressive narrowing of the gaps in living standards, employment and economic development in Europe. That is what I mean by real economic convergence. The Foreign Secretary has made similar remarks, and the Chancellor has also talked about real economic convergence. The Foreign Secretary has made similar remarks, and the Chancellor has also talked about real economic convergence. Real economic convergence, not simply financial and monetary convergence, is important if Europe is to be popular with its citizens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the hon. Gentleman believe should happen in the case of a period of zero or negative growth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a hypothetical question. I do not envisage such circumstances arising. It is true that growth in the European Union has been relatively slow. Nevertheless, growth has occurred. I look forward to a time when growth will accelerate—not excessively, but sufficiently to maintain high employment and to achieve convergence between member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The United States of America covers a large region and has a large and wealthy population. The different states have the benefit of a common currency, language and culture yet they have not achieved the real economic convergence that the hon. Gentleman describes. How does the hon. Gentleman expect convergence to happen in Europe, which has many more divisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point. I said, "if". If the European Union achieves convergence, it will mean some redistribution and help across national boundaries if it is to succeed. If it does not succeed and economic divergence occurs, that will be a problem. The hon. Member for East Londonderry made a fair point. Earlier, I said that we must sustain and increase structural fund spending. Over the years, it should substantially replace the CAP as the major item in the budget. That is the way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.12 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to make a few remarks, about or procedures. If the public were able to witness this morning's charade, they would be deeply shocked by the methodological change that afflicts the House when it confronts the complexity of the documentation. We can only deliberate on it and take note. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells told us not to take note of the proposals. However, it will not make the slightest difference. The proposals will go forward regardless. That is an example of the way in which our people and our Parliament are demeaned. The dignity and the democractic self government of our country are being steadily eroded. We can understand the reason for that if we examine the budgetary processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no effective democratic control: we are asked to rely on the European Parliament. Who among our constituents know their Members of the European Parliament? Do Members of the European Parliament hold surgeries, or deal with the real problems, such as housing, health and welfare, that afflict real people? No, they do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the budgetary proposals will have a profound effect indirectly. They constitute an opportunity cost. The proposed £7 million in gross contributions from the United Kingdom to the European Union, could, in the view of most of my constituents, be better spent at home. They are conscious of ever longer waiting lists and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
inadequacy of the old age pension. They see the declining structure and fabric of their schools. So many complaints of that kind could be partly addressed by more money, yet the Government willingly and knowingly allocate that money to an organisation that is at best malign, and at worst, fraudulent at the core.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In today's 	<i>Financial Times</i>, the Minister was quoted as saying of the Court of Auditors report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This report makes disturbing reading".</p></blockquote>
The Minister at least had time to read it; it would have been much better if members of the Committee had had time to do so. During the time that the Minister spent reading the report and vouchsafing her comments to the press, she could have ensured that it was distributed to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>Financial Times</i> quotation of the Minister's comments on the report continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but it is a useful tool."</p></blockquote>
The Committee needs every tool available to it to scrutinise the budget responsibly. How sad that we did not have the report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a little confused. The European Court of Auditors report is a retrospective report; it criticises the role of the previous Government, not of this Government. As my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I think that you have a duty to prevent the Committee from being misled. The Minister persists in deliberately misleading the Committee. She knows that the report is available to anyone in the world on the internet, but it is not available to the Committee or to the House in written form. She has persistently said that there is a copy in the Library; that was emphatically untrue five minutes before our sitting began, as I was told by officers of the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the responsibility of the Chair to ensure that documents to be discussed in the Committee are available. That is a question for the Minister. The Minister has said that in her opinion the report was placed in the Library. I assume that that is the case and I am sure that she spoke in good faith. What is clear is that the Chair does not have responsibility for the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I wish to conclude the quotation from 	<i>the Financial Times</i>, as it is germane to the debate. What is at stake is hon. Members' knowledge of the probity of an organisation to which we are asked to approve, or at least to scrutinise, the voting of funds by the Government. The Minister said of the report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is a useful tool in the fight against fraud and mismanagement."</p></blockquote>
The Committee was denied that tool. At best, that was regrettable; at worst, I would say that it was verging on a dereliction of duty by the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The hon. Gentleman has made a serious allegation against me—that of dereliction of my duties as a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Minister. As his allegation is based on a matter that directly relates to the previous and not to the current Government, I seek your guidance as to what redress I have against the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) is responsible for the words that he utters in the Committee, in the same way that any individual Member is responsible for what they say in the House. The Minister will know that she has methods of redress, should she wish to use them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister does have such methods, Mrs. Dunwoody, as indeed do you if we err in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I wanted to make was a corporate one. I understand some of the difficulties faced by the Minister. She has reams of Euro-paper to consider. Hon. Members suffocate, we drown in the reams of Euro-paper. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] Let me continue, because it is important. The President of the Court of Auditors, as reported in the 	<i>Financial Times</i>, said that his court was
	<br><blockquote><p>"unable to give an affirmative statement regarding the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying payments".</p></blockquote>
If that was an auditor's report into a limited company, other limited companies would be on very unsound ground if they continued to trade with that organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a recurrent theme in the Committee—it happens year after year—that we express hope that something will be done about the matter but we know that nothing will. That is why I asked the Minister whether she could report to this Committee any indictments for fraud or negligence and say whether there were any convictions or any concrete evidence of anything actually being done about it. Every pound that goes walkies in the corridors of Brussels or anywhere else is money that could be better spent at home. We should bear in mind that our principle duty in this place as custodians of the interests of our constituents is to ensure that their hard-earned money is appropriately applied to interests and causes that benefit them. [HON. MEMBERS: "Will the hon. Gentleman give way."] No, I will not. Other people want to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a few examples. First, the common agricultural policy consumes the greater part of the European Union budget. It is important that the Government recognise that they are hamstrung by qualified majority voting. Much of the time their pious expressions of hope are just whistling in the wind. The Minister gave the good example of the horrendous matter of tobacco subsidies. I asked whether she would abate our contribution to the European Union because subsidising tobacco growing is consciously aiding and abetting the increase of morbidity in European Union countries. We must face the truth: that is what it is about. When asked is she would abate our contribution, the Minister said no, it would be illegal to do so. That is why I said that we are becoming more and more subejct to a malign, alien power over which we have very little influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
I cited set-aside. In years gone by, before the United Kingdom came under the common agricultural policy, almost every acre of our country that could be cultivated was cultivated. This Government believe in encouraging the work ethic; their social security programme is being reconstructed to encourage work, but big landowners—especially cereal producers, if the press are to be believed—receive up to £1 million in subsidy to set much of their land aside. Is that right, when half the world is starving? It is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), who had the intellectual honesty to recognise the gravity of the situation, asked what would happen after enlargement. Surely, we desire enlargement, because Government spokesmen always aver that we do. If we are to reduce the divisions that have plagued our continent since the end of the second world war, we need, as soon as possible, to bring the countries of central and eastern Europe into the community of free, sovereign, democratic nations within the European Union. That will be made much harder by the perpetuation of the common agricultural policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another malign influence in the European Union, which will receive more subsidies according to documentation, is the fisheries policy. What has that policy done for the people of our country? Many worthy, fine communities around our coasts have gone to the wall in areas where there is probably no alternative employment. We have been quite happy to acquiesce and to vote more money for more of our fishermen to decommission their boats because our waters—ours under international law—are regarded as a common resource. After enlargement, there will be even more pressure, on that common resource, and presumably our subsidy will increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is confronted with a sad state of affairs. It is the humiliation of our country. We were a proud, fully democratic, self-governing nation, yet now we are subject to an alien law over which we have no control. We are supposed to exercise scrutiny over budgetary processes that we cannot materially influence or alter. However, gradually the educative process of the Committee will have an effect, not least on Labour Members, and I should not be surprised if before the end of five years many of them will have seen the light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.26 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, was entertaining, but also quite sad. It summed up much of what has been going wrong. The hon. Gentleman and I share a Member of the European Parliament in Robert Evans, the Member for London, North-West. He holds regular surgeries—more than his predecessor. In my role as a councillor in Harrow before I became a Member of Parliament, I had copious correspondence with him on any number of issues ranging from council to European level. He serves his constituency well and I hope that he will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
I should like to be able to think of a nice way to tell the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) that if one lies down with dogs, one gets fleas. Rather than worrying about being lumped together with the Conservatives he should reflect that he will be judged by his actions, not his words. He gave a good impression of being a Conservative towards the end of the previous Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The saddest comment that we heard came not from the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood—his remarks were to be expected, as he is comfortable on his own little planet, along with others—but from the right hon. Member for Wells. I repeat my earlier question—which I fully accept was out of order—about what we have learned today from Opposition Members that we could not have learned in July. For what compelling reason have we been brought back to "scrutinise" the draft budget a second time? The answer is none. Admittedly, the exercise provides the odd Opposition Member who is not a member of the Committee time to pop along and ask a few questions, but no substantial matter has emerged, in terms of scrutiny, that could not have emerged before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note with interest that for the second run of European Standing Committee B on the draft budget, we have been inundated with a Liberal presence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I compliment—because I did not get a chance before—the hon. Member for West Dorset on his candid comments at the end of our previous sitting, in which he described himself as an extremist. I am not paraphrasing too much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot go back over previous sittings of the Committee. We are dealing with the papers that are before us today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. Interestingly, earlier in today's sitting the hon. Member for West Dorset described previous events relating to the budget as an unnecessary charade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Labour Members agree about the quality, or otherwise, of the scrutiny process. We said at the end of the previous sitting that, if there was scope for informal Committee discussions of the scrutiny process—especially with regard to something as important as the budget—we were more than happy for that to take place. But getting this bounced from the Select Committee back to this Committee without any substantive new points is, to echo my hon. Friend the Minister, playing games. That is not to decry the points made about tobacco, arable crops and even lump-sum payments and agriculture, but none of them was new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yes, we had the fortune, perhaps, to have the report from the European Court of Auditors tagged on today, but there is nothing new in it and nothing that is strictly relevant. I hope that the Select Committee will bounce that our way because it would be useful for us to spend some time on it. If it does so, I hope that we shall examine it constructively, free from the entirely unnecessary anti-European wranglings, which do the scrutiny process, which some have challenged, no credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
We have a scrutiny role to perform. Even this morning, we could have performed it far better had we taken it seriously and not just scored silly little points or been trapped in the dark ages like the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. He could have written his speech 20 years ago for all the progress that those on his side of the argument have made. Having had since July to sharpen up his attack and get to grips with the documentation, all that the right hon. Member for Wells could say of page 3 was, "The top's not photocopied." That is extent of the piercing scrutiny of Conservative Members. It is quite pathetic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us get together to give these documents the scrutiny they deserve. We have no done that today and we did not do so at the previous sitting of the Committee. It is not enough for hon. Members to say that they have no faith in achieving anything at European forums. Some useful comments have been made, but they have simply drifted in the ether because there is no focal point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for East Londonderry that if 100 million ecu are wasted, as some other sums have been, the 100 million ecu for the Northern Ireland peace process will be a misspent opportunity. Somewhere in the House we need not just to welcome that 100 million ecu for the peace process but to scrutinise how it will be spent most effectively throughout the two communities. I say that not least because I have family and friends in Donegal, which would be the obvious indirect recipient of any benefit that accrues from that money or the peace process generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look in more detail at the scrutiny process. The Opposition have not done themselves proud in any of their contributions this morning. It seemed to have escaped the notice of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, that we now have a Government, who take fraud seriously and in substance, not just in empty rhetoric. We will be able to secure a good deal. We take and will take, as we have shown nationally, financial probity and budgets seriously. We will still have to put up with it as it comes with the territory, but nationally people will not have to put up with empty rehtoric, handbags and no substantive delivery. They will finally see serious documents such as this being given a proper airing and a proper defence of Britain's interests in all the European forums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should make it clear to the Committee that the hon. Member for Luton, North has apologised to me for having to leave for a very important reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some comment was made earlier about the fact that I acted like a Conservative. Well actually I am a Conservative, although I am not a member of the Conservative party. I am a member of the Unionist party, which is generally a right-of-centre party and I am very proud to occupy that position in the political spectrum. But we are not tied to the policies of any major party in this House and have not been for very many years. For that reason, I welcome the Government's welfare-to-work
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
proposals, which I find most interesting. We shall scrutinise them closely because they will do much to eliminate fraud in some areas of national expenditure. For that reason I also generally welcome the Chancellor of the Exchequer's decision to maintain the Conservatives' spending and taxation budget plans. Whether he will be able to stick to them through the years is another matter that we shall consider in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not, of course, like to be lumped together with all the previous Government's policies any more than would many Conservative Members of the Committee as regards Europe—or, for that matter, some right hon. and hon. Labour Members, among whom there are deep divisions over Europe. They are well concealed for the moment, although judging by some of what I have heard this morning I suspect that as we debate these issues in the coming years they will be revealed. The reason for the second bite at the cherry is to extend the time for debate and the learning process, which is now under-estimated by many new Members of the House. The Government of the day always like to foster that under-estimation because they do not want the endless debate or the educative process to continue. They do not want Members to hear a differing opinion; they want to keep it in a little box so that they can get the Whips easily to impose their will. Having been a Whip, my advice is that Members should never be too anxious to obey the Whips without question. They usually just want to get the business through, which is not always necessary or in the country's best interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that off my chest, I look with interest at the motion. The Committee
	<br><blockquote><p>"takes note of the European Community Documents … and supports the Government's efforts to maintain budget discipline in the Community."</p></blockquote>
My one real quibble with that is that we are exhorted only to "maintain budget discipline". The Minister said that every effort would be made to tighten up and improve budget discipline. I greatly regret that she did not say that this morning. It is not the maintenance of present discipline or scrutiny that interests us; we should be seeking considerable improvement. When the hon. Lady replies, will she make it clear that if the Opposition had been more careful in their scrutiny, they could have tightened budget discipline instead of maintaining the lax standards that we have had to tolerate for so many years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said this morning that the interests of consumers must be paramount for the Goverment. I agree. However, the safe and secure supply of food is important among those interests. I recall reading a story about an elderly north American Indian, Chief Carry-the-Kettle, who was highly respected because he always managed to site his tribe where there was plenty of food and so was always able to feed them. We in this country are blessed with a favourable climate for food production; we are also blessed in that we have long had access to large amounts of cheap, high-quality food. But we are becoming increasingly concerned
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
about the amount of chemicals that we pour on to our crops and into our land and our stocks, sometimes with unforeseen consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all the problems of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and there is the hullabaloo about organophospherous dips for sheep and the dangers of the downstream ill-effects on all forms of life. If we are to be able to guarantee the quality of the food that we produce, we should try to produce as much as possible—at least of the temperate foodstuffs that we can grow—within the bounds of safety. We will not grow tobacco—I hope. I have questioned strongly whether we should be growing oil-seed rape, which is an abominable crop requiring a huge subsidy to make it worth while growing in the first place when it can be purchased much more cheaply elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two workmen are planting hedges for me. With the assistance of a grant, huge amounts were spent over many years ripping them out. I was never so foolish as to do so. Where there was fair wear and tear, I was happy to receive some grant to replace hedges that had deteriorated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us keep the interests of the consumer firmly in mind, but let us also be sensible in what we do. The agricultural policy that we have followed has often been the Cinderella of Government policy, and I have never been satisfied that enough thought or research has been invested in our food policy. We should know how best to benefit the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I and almost every farmer is most unhappy about producing food that is profitable only because of large subsidies from various sources. That is not healthy for agriculture or for the country. New Zealand did away with all its agricultural subsidies. It caused considerable hardship, but if we are to move towards a desirable end we need to tell people the truth about the cost of producing high-quality food. The changes have to be made over a long period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Set aside provisions are a consequence of milk quotas, cattle and sheep quotas and all the rest. Yet we had a perfect opportunity—I know a former Minister would have preferred this option—to adopt the livestock unit policy that applies to sheep and beef cattle industries. We could thus have tied cattle and sheep numbers to acreage and avoided creating quotas. Those quotas will haunt the agricultural community of this country for many years in relation to capital tax purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are large sums to the average small farmer such as milk producers, cattle and sheep farmers. We will certainly not get out of this mess until we restore to national Governments responsibility and support for their agricultural industries. Getting involved in the common agricultural policy was one of the biggest mistakes this country ever made. It has cost farmers and the whole nation dear. We need to revamp it completely to get out of the mess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will also have to consider the social structuring and restructuring of farming that will result from making the change. At present, far too few people are looking after far too much stock and land.

Let me return to the peace process in Northern Ireland. I can tell the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) that I welcome the money, particularly if it will be used to repair the damage that has been done to Northern Ireland. My concern is that scrutiny should apply not only afterwards, but during the disbursement of funds. Instead of allowing various voluntary bodies, community groups and God knows who else to spend this money, it would have been far better if it had been disbursed through the elected bodies in Northern Ireland—the councils, which have appropriate structures to ensure that the money is spent properly. I hope that the Government will consider carefully what has gone on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have grave suspicions about some of the voluntary bodies that have grown up in Northern Ireland. They include all sorts of bodies from those representing concerned residents right through to genuine groups. The best way to look after public money is to ensure that it passes through the formal structure of elected bodies, which have financial officers who ensure that it is properly spent. Those officers can help to prevent fraud. However, if it does take place, they enable it to be easily detected. It is not a light matter, but a serious one. I hope that the Government will take heed of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funds that I have described will not appear as a separate item in the budget; they will come from other areas. Therefore, will the Minister tell us from which areas they will come, especially as it appears that other areas will receive less money? If the £100 million disappears as a separate heading, it will be skimmed off from elsewhere. Where will it come from?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Northern Ireland had a form of devolution such as the proposed Welsh Assembly, it could take a global view of the money spent there. That would be healthy for everyone involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trans-European networks will have 560 mecu, or £379 million to spend. I am not sure what is meant by trans-European networks, but I assume that the term refers to rail and road transport networks. If my assumption is correct, may I have an assurance that some of that money will be spent on the west coast line? May I have an assurance that the money spent internally in Northern Ireland will be spent on the road network, because we do not have railways there?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If some of the money is to be spent on roads on this side of the water, can it be spent on those transit areas that may not benefit the areas through which the road runs, but which benefit other areas of the United Kingdom? As the Economic Secretary will not be surprised to hear, the road that I have in mind is that which runs from the Mull of Galloway to the main north-south motorway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether she has travelled along that road recently, but I have done so twice in recent weeks. A number of improvements have been made over the years, and we are grateful for them. However, a huge proportion of Irish road traffic pours up and down that road. Although the road is not of much economic benefit to south-west Scotland—I appreciate that—it is a vital part of our road network. Therefore, I want considerable improvements to be made. They would
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
not only have an economic benefit for Northern Ireland, but for the island of Ireland as a whole. Will the hon. Lady and her colleagues keep that suggestion in mind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is meant by the term "across-the-board cuts"? Does it mean a general cut of 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 or whatever per cent. to each item of expenditure, or does it mean that the percentage cut varies from one item to another?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I know that you, Mrs. Dunwoody, do not want us to revisit the debate in July, but it relates to the scrutiny process. As in July, much of the debate has been about documents. The right hon. Member for Wells—I apologise that a cold coupled with a Scots accent misled the hon. Member for East Londonderry—concentrated on the provision of documents. I can see from this Room how much paper has to be made available for this Committee, and I am well aware of the importance of ensuring that documents are provided. On 31 July, I wrote to the right hon. Member for Wells, pointing out to him that we operated on the criteria established in December 1993 in the Cabinet Office guidance for Departments on the parliamentary scrutiny of European Community documents. As I said in July, the right hon. Gentleman knows, when he criticises the provision of documents—in Opposition, my hon. Friends referred to their availability—that he is criticising not me, but my juniors, who do the photocopying. They are being criticised in the Committee, and I deplore that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the highest regard for the civil servants in the Minister's Department, especially because they served me, too. They are part of an efficient, effective machine and the hon. Lady is extremely lucky to be a beneficiary of it. I do not criticise her staff, but she is responsible for their actions. As we had a row in July about the provision of documents, I would have expected the Minister to have taken a personal interest in the type and timeliness of the documents provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have taken a personal interest in these matters, so much so that I know that the ECA report to which the right hon. Gentleman referred was delivered to the Library at 8.45 am today. There were no staff available to receive it, so it was left there by Treasury officials, as one would expect. During the debate, Library staff confirmed that they have the document. I do not know what happened within the Library, but the right hon. Gentleman is making a silly point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Court of Auditors report proves beyond doubt that the previous Government were weak on fraud and weak on the causes of fraud. They had 18 years to sort it out and for 18 years they failed to do so. I am not surprised that the right hon. Gentleman could not get his act together to table an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
amendment to the motion. Indeed, there should have been an opportunity for much greater scrutiny, because that is important. I believe that one reason why there is no amendment, given the brass neck that it takes to be a member of the Tory party these days, is that the right hon. Member for Wells would have had great difficulty criticising the budget that we have introduced this year. The right hon. Gentleman is on record in the Second Reading of the European Community Finance Bill on 28 November 1994 defending a higher contribution to the Community budget than the 1.12 per cent. of GDP contained in the Council's draft budget. Indeed, the right hon. Gentleman took the legislation that gave effect to the Edinburgh agreement through the House. I do not blame the right hon. Gentleman for looking embarrassed; I would look embarrassed if I were in his position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read the Select Committee report of the discussions on scrutiny; the hon. Member for West Dorset made a valid point about how we should improve scrutiny and how important it was that better information was available. How can we do that when the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood says that we are talking to a "malign and alien power"? Is that how a mature Parliament discusses its relationship with its neighbours? Such remarks gives the process of scrutiny a bad name. We missed the opportunity for proper scrutiny this morning and I deplore that, because with proper scrutiny I would have a better case to put before the European Council next Wednesday. Instead, there was the usual Pavlovian response when European issues are being discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that there is proper scrutiny of the EC expenditure and revenue proposals and I am happy to discuss them. The right hon. Member for Wells referred to the European Parliament's administrative budget. The European Parliament's administrative expenses are not considered by the European Council. The right hon. Gentleman did not object to the procedure when he was in my place—he was right not to object—but it would be no folly if there were some consistency in his views. The agreement benefits the Council of Ministers because the expenditure is non-obligatory. If the Parliament considered the budget, it would have a final say on the Council's resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also asked whether I would be prepared to delete all the European Parliament's proposals for increases. That shows the failings of Conservatives for the past 18 years. In Scotland, we have a saying, "It's my ball and you're not playing". That sums up the right hon. Gentleman's position. I must point out to the hon. Member for East Londonderry that whenever one does not get one's own way, one picks up the ball and runs away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government carped about the concept of the European Union and did not enter into constructive discussions. The secret of negotiation is to make a deal between the Council and the European Parliament. That requires some diplomacy. What
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
chance exists for diplomacy if we believe that there are "malign and alien" forces on the other side of the channel? That is a deplorable little Englander position. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) referred to it as sad. He was right. The new Government is modern, fair and outward looking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Wells is interested in anti-fraud measures. I wish that he had been a little more interested when his party was in government. That would have given us a better starting point. The right hon. Gentleman claims that 15 per cent. of antifraud expenditure is spent directly by the Commission. He says that the Commission should have a bigger anti-fraud budget to cover that. The right hon. Gentleman thus sets his Euro-scepticism on its head. The Commission manages the money, but member states, in whose territory the fraud takes place, deal with fraud. Is it the Conservatives' new policy that the European Union should be involved in home affairs matters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Wells is wrong to claim that the Commission's fraud expenditure is falling. He is considering only one budget line. Several budget lines relate to fraud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have little time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrote to the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), who raised those matters in July. I will be happy to write to him again. When the right hon. Member for Wells was a Minister he said that he did not believe in spending money for the sake of it. I agree with that. Expenditure must be properly targeted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman requested additional information on member states' net contributions. It is easier to do that retrospectively. It cannot be done quickly. Publishing forecasts for other member states would prove difficult, but I undertake to examine the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a thoughtful speech about enlargement and the issues that we will have to confront, my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North asked about structural funds. As a Scot, I have a great interest in structural funds. I fully sympathise with the reference that my hon. Friend made to his constituency. However, we must bear in mind that the United Kingdom is a net contributor to structural funds. Therefore, reform is essential before enlargement. We need to target expenditure more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also mentioned CAP reform. There was an exchange about enlargement and the prospects for growth. If markets are enlarged, so are the prospects for growth. However, there is another point to be borne in mind and I shall conclude by speaking about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was distressed by the comments of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood about a "malign and alien" force. The European Union provides an opportunity to improve the security of our country and of Europe. All of us who are committed to enlargement—my party was committed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
enlargement in the general election—recognise not just the economic benefits but the fact that it will lead to a more united and stronger Europe. I commend that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had another opportunity this morning to scrutinise the budget. I am glad that I am able to come here with an improvement on the position that we faced in July. I will continue to be vigilant and forthright in the European Council. I hope that in the longer term we can see genuine scrutiny of the European budget rather than the usual response that we get from Conservative Members, which has more to do with divisions in their party than with representing Britain's interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
