<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr O'Hara. It is evident that the Committee has attracted a large number of Members. Is it possible to move to a larger Room for the comfort of all?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that will be possible. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] If we had had more notice that so many people intended to attend, we might have been able to do something about it. The meeting is scheduled for this Room and I do not know whether we would be able to find a larger Room within the time allotted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Can you guide us on how you intend to conduct the meeting? It is obvious that many colleagues who may wish to catch your eye are unable to sit in the body of the Committee. If you are unable to organise another Room, Members would appreciate guidance on how they can participate in our proceedings when space is at a premium.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Townend</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I understand that Room 10 is available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I have sat on European Standing Committee B for two Parliaments. Our principle has always been that any Member of Parliament can turn up to express a view on his constituents' behalf or in the national interest. There should be no artificial constraint on Members' ability to take part, and such constraint would be quite contrary to the principle on which the European Standing Committees were set up seven or eight years ago. It would be a shocking precedent and would make nonsense of our system for scrutinising European legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. As one who must stand because I have no chair, I invite you to cite the precedent by which Members are required to give notice that they intend to attend a meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any such precedent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. That rather goes against what you said earlier.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Might the Committee adjourn to allow you time to consider this matter, or to take up the practical suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Townend) and move to Room 10?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'> I was about to suggest that we adjourn for five minutes to clarify the situation. We will adjourn until 10.38 am.</span></p>
<p>10.33 am</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
<p>10.38 am</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: During the Committee's suspension I checked whether Committee Room 10 was available. It is not dressed, and the recording console is not yet in order, but that is being dealt with. If Committee Members currently have a bottle of water in front of them, they should take it with them to Committee Room 10. The Committee will formally reconvene and commence its proceedings at 10.45 am in Room 10. We shall go on until 1.15 pm, which is the latest that we can sit, but that will give us the full two and a half hours.</span></p>
<p>10.39 am.</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, Mr. O'Hara. Your flexibility in re-arranging our proceedings from Room 9 to Room 10 in such a short time was admirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that is a point of order, but its expression is appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I associate myself with the previous point of order, Mr. O'Hara?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Swinney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. May I also associate myself with the comments made on the re-organisation of events?<br><br>
We have only one hour for questions. Will those of us who are members of the Committee and attend as often as we can be accorded preference in the selection of questioners, or will we be treated the same as the Johnny-come-latelys who have arrived this morning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All Members of the House are entitled to attend the Committee, ask questions and express their views, but only members of the Committee are entitled to vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I too would like to thank the Officers of the House for the speed with which they changed rooms. I was involved in a similar incident some years ago. I do not want to cause embarrassment, but I am happy to debate the matter if other hon. Members arrive wanting to participate in our proceedings—I am quite happy for them to sit

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
either side of the Committee—even if that means adjourning to the Chamber because there is insufficient room here.<br><br>
My initial comments will be brief, as is required. We are discussing a wide issue, although it may be somewhat narrowed by the interests of hon. Members. "Agenda 2000" covers the Commission's proposals for reform of the common agricultural policy and I shall make some preliminary points about three or four of the sectors affected.<br><br>
We can expect pressure on the CAP from the increasing trend towards liberalisation of world trade. We all know that the prospect of enlargement of the European Union will add to that pressure, as is made abundantly clear in the documents from the Select Committee and the Commission.<br><br>
A more pressing concern are the structural market imbalances which can be seen in major sectors such as beef and dairy. It is essential that the EU act to address those mounting problems by moving to a more market-oriented common agricultural policy, with less emphasis on production-related support and more emphasis on protection of the environment and the wider rural economy. We can all support that in general.<br><br>
The Government welcome the direction marked by the proposals. They will help to reduce food prices and the massive—some would say catastrophic—bureaucracy associated with the CAP, but they do not go far enough. I shall refer briefly to four sectors.<br><br>
The Government's view is that the Commission's proposals for the arable sector are a significant step in the right direction, although we would have preferred to go further in some areas. A 20 per cent. price cut is proposed, which seems about right to bring European prices in line with world levels and to remove export subsidies, at least for wheat. European food producers must compete in a world economy, which they are prevented from doing.<br><br>
We agree with the Commission that the rate of area aid should compensate only in part for the price cut. There has been overcompensation in arable aid in the past. That is not something that people like to discuss openly because such overcompensation is never returned.<br><br>
We would also prefer set-aside to be abolished rather than set at zero.<br><br>
There are proposals for the beef sector, and Opposition Members may wish to discuss them. The Commission proposes significant reductions in support, not least because the problems of structural surplus in the sector are all too apparent; as is the cost of surplus disposal, which means a write-off given the World Trade Organisation constraints on subsidised exports, which are vast.<br><br>
We do not entirely share the Commission's analysis of the market prospects for the sector, which anticipates a return to 1995 consumption levels and therefore suggests that intervention stocks could be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
run down between now and the year 2000. There is a difference of opinion on that matter, and hon. Members may wish to raise that issue.<br><br>
Given the expansion of the suckler herd and the continuing downward trend in consumption, stocks could increase significantly between now and the end of the decade if action is not taken soon to reduce support prices, hence curtailing production.<br><br>
I would like to discuss other matters, but I am somewhat restricted by time. I will touch on the proposals for the dairy sector. The Commission proposes to extend the quota regime to 2006, and gradually to decrease support prices by an average of 10 per cent. over that period. The Government view those proposals as disappointing and wholly inadequate. The proposals effectively leave the quota system intact for the next nine years, without knowledge of what will happen afterwards. Our proposals to improve the flexibility of the dairy regime and to simplify it have not yet been outlined.<br><br>
The 10 per cent. price cut is insufficient to achieve the kind of market orientation needed in the dairy sector: a cut of at least 30 per cent. is needed.<br><br>
We will look very carefully at the proposed yearly compensation payment for the cut in support prices, and at the level at which it will be paid. Payments should assist farmers to adjust to lower prices, and over-compensation must be avoided. Payments should be time-limited, degressive and decoupled from production. They must not discriminate against United Kingdom farmers.<br><br>
Finally—because of my limited time—I shall touch on agri-environment and rural development issues. Agriculture has a great influence on the countryside, wildlife and conservation. All hon. Members know that, whether they represent urban or countryside constituencies. The distinction between the representation of the countryside and of urban areas in the House is less clear than it used to be—more countryside constituencies are now represented by Labour Members than by Opposition Members. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where are they?"] The Government will ensure—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. No interventions are allowed during the Minister's first, short statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a short statement, and I am coming to the end of it.<br><br>
The Government will ensure that measures targeted to help the environment have a high priority within a reformed CAP, together with measures for rural development. Our long-term aim must be the phasing out of production-related support. That should mitigate some of the environmental problems currently associated with the CAP, such as overgrazing of sensitive areas.<br><br>
The Commission's proposals for greater integration of rural development and agri-environment measures make good sense. We wish to establish a more defensible Community framework, which encourages farmers and other rural entrepreneurs to create wealth and provide jobs in rural areas, whilst preserving and enhancing our countryside.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0133">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The Commission's proposals lack detail at present. The formal legal texts should appear in the early part of next year, which should put flesh on the bones. [<i>Laughter.</i>] Not having those texts makes it difficult for this House and for others to comment on the proposals in detail, but the texts should be available in February or March. Hon. Members will understand what I mean—the Commission will put flesh on the bones, and I am not in the least touchy about that issue.<br><br>
Only once those legal texts are available will the House and United Kingdom industry be fully able to grasp the Commission's plans to reform the CAP. That reform is long overdue—it is costing British families the best part of £16 to £20 per week in increased food prices, which they should not have to pay. Those increased food prices are the result of the crazy system that we are locked into, and we will do everything that we can to unlock Britain during our presidency, and to set the reform agenda on an unstoppable progressive road.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Some hon. Members not be familiar with the special rules of the European Committees. We have one hour from the commencement of the opening statement—until 11.45 am—for questions. The debate will begin at the end of that hour. It may, however, begin before that time if there are no more questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the beef and livestock sector as being subject to reform under agenda 2000. Does he realise that so many right hon. and hon. Members have attended this morning to show their annoyance and disgust with the way in which the Government are treating the beef industry? Will he come clean and tell us what the Government are going to do to ensure that there is a viable United Kingdom beef industry capable of withstanding the rigours of the agenda 2000 proposals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Honestly, I do not think right hon. and hon. Members have come here in a state of annoyance and disgust. I hope that they have not, at least. [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes, we have."] The problems did not start in May or last week. What Opposition Members are not honest enough to tell their beef producers and farmers is that the actions and inactions of the previous Government got us into this mess. They are good at dishing out criticism, but they have to learn to take it. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer!"] I am not here to make statements on issues raised by the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack). Indeed, he tried the same thing at Question Time last week, and the Government's position is the same as it was then. We are not going to act under duress. I would be interested to hear the right hon. Member for Fylde reiterate the Government's point that illegal action which restrains and interferes with free trade is doing the farmers and the beef industry no good whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am answering the right hon. Gentleman's question. He may not like the answer, but that is what I am doing. I have not come here to please him. I am here so that the Government can be subjected to scrutiny on agenda 2000 and other aspects of their policy. Hon. Members may not like the answers, but the Government's position remains exactly as it was last week. No extra help will be offered under duress. Perhaps Opposition Members will join the Government in making it clear that we are not going to bend under the duress of illegal activities that interfere with free trade.<br><br>
I shall conclude by saying that in Question Time last week and later in the press the right hon. Member for Fylde called for special help for the beef industry. In the same breath and sentence he called for the rest of the farming industry to receive the same help. He must make up his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, he did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, he did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member did. I can quote his words. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any compensation package should be to the benefit of the hardest-pressed and not leave other areas out."</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? Opposition Members say that they want help for one special sector while insisting that that help also be given to the rest of the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is it right that a Minister of the Crown should selectively quote from a non-official publication for the benefit of a cheap debating point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not regard that as a matter for the Chair. However, I would ask the Minister to draw his remarks to a close.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Borrow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a Member representing a constituency with a significant agricultural interest that is largely excluded from the CAP, may I ask the Minister how much the British taxpayer is paying towards the beef industry in the UK?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A considerable amount of money. I am happy to stick to agenda 2000 or to answer any other questions hon. Members wish to ask, as long as you take them all in order, Mr. O'Hara. I am prepared to be wholly flexible.<br><br>
My hon. Friend asked about support for the beef industry in the year 1997–98. We have given a global figure of £1.4 billion, but Committee members will be interested to know that that is not all BSE-related expenditure, which is ring-fenced and totals £838 million this year. To break that figure down, MAFF's contribution is some £83 million, to pay for the specified risk material controls, for renderers and for administrative and other costs. But a massive part of the £838 million comes from the intervention board and the over-thirty-months scheme—a valuable scheme for the industry in terms of removing cattle from the market; purchase costs £252 million and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0134">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
disposal costs £137 million. Of our other figures, beef intervention accounts for £186 million and the selective cull accounts for a further £100 million. Those are all figures for public expenditure—taxpayers' money.<br><br>
Non-BSE-related expenditure on the industry this year totals almost £500 million: the beef special premium scheme is costing £219 million; the hill livestock compensatory allowances are costing £52 million and the suckler cow premium scheme is costing £218.<br><br>
Anyone who claims that the Government are not supporting the beef industry should explain what we are doing giving £1.4 billion of taxpayers' money to the beef industry. I emphasise that it is not the Government's money; it is taxpayers' money, my constituents' money and money of the constituents of the right hon. Member for Fylde that is being handed out to support the beef industry. It is no good Opposition Members implying that the Government are not assisting the beef industry when our assistance totals £1.4 billion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baldry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With an almost 40 per cent. fall in farm incomes this year, and with cheap European imports forcing down livestock and farming prices, can the Minister estimate what will be left of the UK farming industry, in particular the beef sector, by the year 2000?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very difficult to give such an estimate because we are unable at the moment to announce any genuine progress with the European Parliament and the lifting of the beef ban, which the previous Government said they would get lifted in November last year. As we made clear at Question Time last week, we have put forward two proposals, currently being discussed in detail in Brussels, which would make a considerable contribution. So it is difficult to estimate what the size of the beef industry will be in the year 2000.<br><br>
Before BSE, there was a long-term decline in the consumption of red meat. That cannot be denied. The Commission thinks that we can get consumption back to pre-BSE levels. We dispute that because we believe that there has been a decline in consumption that is unrelated to BSE. I suspect that there will be a smaller industry as a result of that decline, and as a result of the delay in getting the ban lifted, even though officials from MAFF are daily negotiating aspects of the ban in Brussels. We are moving fast to get the computerised cattle traceability system up and running. That will be working in the UK in advance of any other member state, which is a major step and a requirement under the Florence agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to cereals, what choices are open to us under the programme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent question, which takes us away from a subject—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that all Committee Members are keen to hear the Minister's answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. To assist our debate, would it be in order for the Minister to return to the question of the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis) later, so that we can properly discuss the previous subject? I notice that the Minister has just been handed his bluffer's guide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a bogus point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Finchley and Golders Green asks a fair question. The European Union must decide on its approach to cereals. The ever-increasing rates of set aside are related to the 1992 reforms. We must phase out price support for cereals and decouple support from production, although some Opposition Members may find those unpleasant concepts. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that over-compensation has been excessive in respect of cereals and that the taxpayer never benefits. Fluctuations in the currency cause problems. When currency prices move in one direction, farmers say, "You must compensate us," but when they go in the other direction, farmers are happy to take the extra money and keep quiet. There is much embarrassment whenever this matter is raised.<br><br>
We are encouraged by the Commission's decision to reduce support prices to world levels. The Government and the Opposition know full well that our farmers cannot compete under the CAP's current regime. Our farmers have told us that they want to compete in the world market because the food production industry is very efficient. If we were not locked into the CAP's bureaucratic regime we should have no problem competing in the world market—hence the need for reform.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the present regime costs the average family £16 a week. On what definition of world prices does he base that figure? He suggests that the housewife is paying too much for beef, but can he give us a figure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, the figures fluctuate. Most statistics are based on the OECD figures. The average of about £4 a week per person—the average family contains four persons—is based on information from the Library and on Government figures. No one denies that if the CAP were reformed and support reduced, world prices would change. I do not suggest that we could reduce food prices by £16 a week for the average family of four people. However, if the CAP were reformed and if we competed in the world market, there is no doubt that world prices would rise—although they might not rise sufficiently to remove the total cost of the regime. They would probably rise to the extent that the average family would get back £3 of the £4. I cannot, unfortunately give the right hon. Gentleman an estimate of the beef price within those figures, but I shall try to do so before the end of our sitting.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Clark</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend the Minister accept that the OECD estimated that the subsidies paid to farmers for milk in 1996 was 44 per cent. of the total price paid and that the subsidy paid for beef was 26 per cent. of the price paid? Does he further accept that reform of the CAP raises the question of enlargement and involves the next round of World Trade Organisation discussions in 1999? The matter is also being consumer led, in that there is a move away from policies that the CAP encouraged—including, for example, intensive farming methods—and towards greater quality and choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised two or three issues. I shall not attempt to address them all, as I do not wish to deprive hon. Members of their chance to ask questions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is right. We are governed by our desire to be a good and effective member of the European Union. In addition, we must comply with World Trade Organisation agreements. There is no doubt that the World Trade Organisation will take matters forward following the Uruguay round commitments. There will be some debate about whether the final proposals of agenda 2000 will be compatible with World Trade Organisation requirements. I have no doubt that the Americans will have something to say about our support for the farming industry.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is right. The common agricultural policy has encouraged people to pursue over-intensive production, creating mountains and lakes of food. I accept that many of those have been diminished following initial reforms, but they might return unless we can dislocate our support mechanism from the quantity of production.<br><br>
Many people would argue that the policy has produced an unhealthy food system, with factory farming, forced feeding and corners being cut. It might even be argued that it contributed to the onset of BSE, through pressure placed on farmers to rush to feed cattle with cheap feed. Farmers understood market prices when feed prices were reduced because of how feed manufacturers pushed the issue. That cheap feed turned out to be contaminated; farmers were feeding cattle to cattle. The result, years later, is £4 billion of public expenditure on BSE alone over the four-year period.<br><br>
There is, therefore, a problem. Dislocating ourselves from the worst excesses of the common agricultural policy should lead to healthier, and cheaper, food production.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am confused by what the Minister meant when he said that he wanted to help farmers by reducing their incomes. I had a meeting with farmers in my constituency about three weeks ago, when they told me that world prices were causing great problems. In agenda 2000, it is suggested that beef regimes will improve after we have removed the problems associated with BSE. By then, however, those farmers may well be out of business.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
On 25 November, the Chancellor announced that he has saved £400 million, largely because of the strength of the currency. That same currency strength is damaging the incomes of farmers. On 3 December, however, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that there is no money available to give the compensation that would naturally have come as a result of the high pound. Is the Minister's policy to put all farmers out of business so that we can then buy our food on the world market?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, certainly not. Our policy is to sustain our agricultural system to ensure that support £1.4 billion for that sector alone—goes to those areas that need it most. Contrary to what the right hon. Member for Fylde argued, it is not a uniform sector. I am happy to provide the longer part of his quote, if pushed.<br><br>
We must target assistance to those who need it most. There is a policy dilemma. There are producers, especially in the hills, who have had a rough time, economically and in terms of food production of cattle and sheep. Such producers cannot be equated with the average; average figures cannot be used in agriculture.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) argued that I emphasised the reduction in prices. I realise that in my brief opening statement, I dealt at greater length with the reduction in prices than with benefits to farmers. A reduction in price is proposed in agenda 2000, but compensatory allowances will be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How much?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Broadly, if the reduction in support prices is reflected in market prices—and that is not always the case—the value of UK beef output for human consumption could reduce by about £370 million. About £290 million would accrue to farmers from the proposed compensation package, so there is a gap of £80 million. Those are agenda 2000 figures.<br><br>
The money would not be spread evenly across the industry. The premium arrangements proposals favour those who produce beef from young bulls of 12 to 14 months old and those finishing steers over 20 months old. Those who rear or finish heifer beef or finish steers at under 23 months would lose most.<br><br>
It is not possible to treat the whole industry in the same way. The current system does not work that way. Agenda 2000 will make compensatory arrangements, but they will not be spread evenly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for touching on the problems of upland areas and peripheral parts of the country, as my own part of north Yorkshire has the problems that he mentioned. Will he expand on the challenges posed to the Union by enlargement? What will be the impact on peripheral areas such as my own? What stance will he take in discussions with colleagues from other European countries?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The House debated enlargement last Thursday. Enlargement is among the most important issues that will face us during our six-month presidency of the EU. Eastern European nations
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
are pressing to join the European Union and we understand and wholly welcome that. Those countries could not apply unless they were democracies. Part of the raison d'être of the European Union is to ensure a democratic, pluralistic framework for the community of nations in Europe. The EU is not simply a defence organisation, but part of a much grander plan.<br><br>
We welcome the fact that countries are queueing up to join for reasons not always related to agriculture or social policy. There is a comfort factor for countries that have suffered difficulties during the 50 years since the second world war.<br><br>
Accession brings difficulties, of course. Mediterranean countries have different needs and demands from our own, as agenda 2000 makes clear. There are problems, for example, with the ludicrous tobacco regime. The UK is not involved, but eight countries produce tobacco—none of which is much good—and the British taxpayer forks out about £600 million to fund that. The accession of Poland will increase EU tobacco production by another 10 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What are you going to do about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have to discuss issues and negotiate so that the accession of other countries brings an opportunity to reform existing policies. One of the greatest pressures for reform of the CAP will be the need to accommodate other countries. They will not be able to enter an unreformed common agricultural policy. If they did, the whole thing would collapse with a catastrophic effect on our farming industry. We must get these things right during negotiations with new entrants so that the UK farming industry is not discriminated against because of enlargement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must be aware of the crisis afflicting the beef sector. The beef industry will be as disappointed as the Opposition have been by the answer that he gave to my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack).<br><br>
In a letter on 7 November 1997, the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—who sits in the other place—said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We will continue to keep the situation under review".</p></blockquote>
I had asked him about additional compensation for currency fluctuations that the Government could make to farmers if they wished to do so. Why does the Minister suppose that his colleague in the upper House said that the situation will be kept under review if the answer is no? The letter goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"we will consider any further evidence they may have of the impact of the revaluations so far on farm income levels."</p></blockquote>
The demonstrations in this country during the past 10 days are proof enough of the crisis in the beef industry. The problem must be addressed now. It is not sufficient for the Minister simply to say that he is going to do nothing because, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) said, there will be no beef industry to help.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is coming to a question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I have got the question, Mr. O'Hara. Will the Government capitulate to unlawful action on the streets?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. That is an outrageous statement. It should be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is the Minister condemning peaceful protest?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am condemning unlawful action on the streets. The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) asked whether we were taking account of the demonstrations over the past few days. He used the word "demonstrations". Peaceful protest that is within the law—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Opposition Members can shout all they like, but I will give them answers. There is no problem with peaceful protest within the law, but we will not react to a protest if it is illegal and interferes with our legal obligations in the single market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gill</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman allows me, I shall answer his important question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bercow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is it in order for the Minister deliberately to filibuster?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not filibustering. He is attempting to answer the question properly posed by the hon. Member for Ludlow. He is being impeded by frequent sedentary interventions. I remind Committee members that it is hard to give all hon. Members who want to ask questions the opportunity to do so. I am helped in my problem of selection by observing those hon. Members who make sedentary interventions because they do not need to be called. Has the Minister finished?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have not. I want to confirm what my noble Friend Lord Donoughue would have said in response to the point made by the hon. Member for Ludlow. The situation is under review. That is not to say that it is on the back burner and that we are not looking at it. We have made it clear that we are prepared to take extra evidence from the industry on the effects of what it is experiencing. We are prepared to consider any alternative to existing programmes that stays within the ceiling—for example, as I hinted in Question Time last week, whether we could shift money from one sector to another. Not many alternatives have been proposed.<br><br>
We have until January—I am not sure of the exact date—to make a request to Brussels which will imply the use of British taxpayers' money. We have made it abundantly clear that for every £100, £71 will be taxpayers' money. The door is not closed. The matter is under review. I am not, however, able to announce the results of the review this morning.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobbin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I received a letter at the weekend from a constituent who is a farmer and who clearly blames the previous Administration for the condition of the farming community. The hon. Member for South Dorset asked about damage done to farming incomes, but it is quite clear where the blame lies. Does the Minister agree that the previous Government's negative attitude to the European Community and their lack of interest in reforming the CAP gave rise to the problems farmers face now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The right hon. Member for Fylde has just said that my hon. Friend was on another planet; as a former Treasury Minister, the right hon. Gentleman should know about being on other planets. On 2 May we did not exactly find the coffers filled with proposals to support the agricultural industry, beef farmers and renderers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Read the Red Book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not need to read the Red Book. We looked in the cupboard and found that the previous Government, knowing that they would lose the election, had not taken decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is pathetic stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman does not like it, but the farming industry's condition was wholly caused by the financial regime of the Conservative Government. I invite the right hon. Gentleman to deny that for every £100 we request from Brussels, £71 would come from the British Exchequer. He never admits that fact, so I invite him to do so today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greenway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to the green pages of the document before us. Point 2.10 on page xiv states that it is
<br><blockquote><p>"the primary purpose of the CAP to 'ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community'".</p></blockquote>
I am disappointed that the Government's comments do not refer to that objective. Page xv comments on the vexed issue of community action versus subsidiarity. Unless we take advantage of mechanisms to ensure fairness, there is no prospect of a level playing field.<br><br>
Does the Minister accept that farmers across the country—in the whole livestock sector, not just the beef sector—are concerned about this matter? A mechanism exists to compensate our farmers for the strength of sterling, which has increased since 1 May because of Government policies. What confidence in the future can farmers and livestock producers have—particularly if the CAP is reformed—if existing mechanisms for fairness throughout the European livestock sector are not used by the UK Government? Will the Minister bear that in mind in deciding whether the Government will provide much needed support before January?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That perfectly legitimate question has been asked before in the House. The answer is yes, we will bear that in mind. We have not said that we will not make a claim under the existing mechanism. We are reviewing the situation. The Opposition may dismiss that, but the industry is in genuine difficulty
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
and no one denies that a mechanism exists. However, before the election we accepted public spending limits set by the previous Government. Accessing the payments would breach those limits becaose £71 of every £100 would be paid by the British taxpayer. That is not to say that we will not make the claim before January, but we are not able to announce a decision today.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised a fair point in the first part of his question concerning the primary purpose of the common agricultural policy. We could have a long discourse on the matter but that would not be appropriate, Mr. O'Hara. Is the primary purpose to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community or, as article 39 of the accession treaty states:
<br><blockquote><p>"to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour"—</p></blockquote>
that is, intensify everything, wreck the countryside and produce unhealthy food. The paradox must be considered when reforming the CAP. What is the CAP for? At the moment there is no answer that is satisfactory to agricultural producers and taxpayers. We shall endeavour to find an answer during the reform negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. John Gray.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I am Mr. James Gray, but I am happy to be recognised.<br><br>
The Minister said in reply to my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde that there is a long-term structural decline in the beef industry because of a decline in consumption. Is he aware that total beef production in this country satisfies only approximately 70 per cent. of domestic demand and that the catastrophic circumstances of CAP the beef industry are connected not with the decline in the consumption of beef but with cheap imports from abroad? When visiting the 2nd battalion of the Parachute Regiment at Aldershot yesterday I was told that the British Army consumes nothing but Uruguayan beef and has done so for many years. Is he not ashamed of that? Is he not confused because he does not know the world price of beef? Will he explain why the British Government buy beef for the British Army from Uruguay, and have done so for many years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the long-term contract entered into by the Ministry of Defence and the British Army clearly predates 1 May. That issue arose before 1 May, when the hon. Gentleman was not a Member of the House.<br><br>
Our beef price at the moment is around 50 per cent. above world levels, depending on quality. The hon. Gentleman is correct that we import cheap beef, but we are not able to impose an import ban. However, from 1 January no beef will come into this country unless it has received exactly the same checks and gone through exactly the same processes that British beef is required to go through. Some countries are specified free of BSE—I do not carry their names in my head—but no beef will be allowed to be sold in this country
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0138">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
unless it fulfils our requirements for removal of risk material, being no older than 30 months and, following last week's announcement and subject to this week's consultation, that will not be sold on the bone. That will apply to imported beef as well as to home-produced beef. We cannot impose an import ban because we are a world player—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We could.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman thinks that we could, but legally we cannot impose a beef import ban.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Other countries have banned ours, so why cannot we ban theirs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have a justifiable reason for banning ours, as the inadequacey of the previous Government proved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Swinney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that I represent a large rural Scottish constituency, but he may not know that it was once the safest Conservative seat in Scotland and was wrestled from them at the election, which reveals the hypocrisy of Conservative Members—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having difficulty hearing the question and I am sure that others are also having difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Swinney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's line on compensation to farmers for the appreciation of sterling seems to be markedly more considered and softer than for some time. I hope that that is an indication of the Government's willingness to engage the farming industry in a discussion about how compensation can be made for the strength of sterling. There is enormous anger in my constituency over cuts in payments under the over-thirty-months scheme and the problem of hill livestock compensation.<br><br>
Will the Minister say what approach the Government intend to take in negotiations with the European Union on agenda 2000? One of my fears is that no systematic transitional approach will be taken in the discussions. The awful spectre of a big bang appears in relation to a change in the regime.<br><br>
Finally, in relation to reform of the CAP, will the Minister tell us how the negotiating stance of this Government differs from that of the previous Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's question. I do not consider the hon. Gentleman a member of the Tory party just because he is sitting on the other side of the Committee.<br><br>
I am trying to be as open and reasonable as possible, but I am not in a position to make any announcements this morning. However, I can confirm what we have already said; that we are not closing off all the options. We genuinely want to be of help to the sectors that need it most and we shall announce the results of the review as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By Christmas?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shortly.<br><br>
Superficially at least, the currency issue looks easy to solve—just pick up the phone and get the money from Brussels. But the money is not in Brussels, it is here in Britain.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right; with agenda 2000, we need the flesh on the bone. Much more needs to come out of Brussels before we can adopt a positive negotiating stance. We do not know whether timetables will be introduced in relation to certain aspects of reform of the CAP. There may not be a big bang. I understand that we shall have further detailed proposals for reform by the end of February or the beginning of March.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked what the difference was between our stance and that of the previous Government. Ministers in the previous Government often spoke about the need to reform the CAP but then did nothing about it. Because of agenda 2000, we have an opportunity to do something. It is not perfect and does not go as far as we would wish, but it is all we have. Some countries in Europe do not want reform. Others will be our partners in seeking to bring about reform but we must achieve it by consent. We will not achieve it by staying away and leaving an empty chair, or by being at war with our partners. We shall achieve reform not by being subservient, but by being reasonable and showing that, unlike the previous Government, we want to be part of the European Union.<br><br>
In the first six months of next year, we shall have an opportunity to ensure that discussions of reform take place in such a way that our successors must take it forward. It is crucial that discussions do not come to an end after the six months of UK presidency. If we have not locked in the future progress of reform by then, we shall have failed. Reform is not going to take place in six months—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will never happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will achieve reform, but not as fast as we would like.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Best</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister advise me whether, in any study of the economic impact of BSE, account will be taken of the delay between identification of the problem in 1996 and the subsequent action two years later? I raise that issue because I think that important lessons, which could be usefully applied in the not-too-distant future, should be learned from that period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend made a slight slip of the tongue: BSE was identified in 1986. The previous Government's delay on the issue was shared in by the House. Both before and after I came into government, I was aware that the Select Committee on Agriculture had considered the issue of BSE, and had decided to do nothing about it. A request by the then Opposition for the subject of BSE to be looked at again was voted down. In those days, such discussions in Select Committees were not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0139">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
possible, because of the way in which the House operates. The Conservative Members on that Committee voted down a further Select Committee inquiry in the early 1990s, when it appeared that BSE was a problem.<br><br>
There is outside pressure—not least from the families and legal representatives of those who have died from new variant CJD—for a public inquiry. There is pressure from sectors of the economy to find out why we got into this mess in the first place. There is pressure to find out why we are committed to spend £4 billion of public money. I assure my hon. Friend and all hon. Members—the tragedies are spread across the country, and there is no party line in terms of tragedies caused by new variant CJD—that we are actively considering what the form and nature of an inquiry should be, and hope to be making an announcement on that soon. Clearly, there will be an inquiry even if we do nothing, as the families of new variant CJD victims who have secured legal aid will go to court. We must take into account whether that is a satisfactory way of attempting to unravel BSE's legacy, which has caused human tragedies as well as economic tragedies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In relation to agenda 2000, what reassurance can the Minister give beef farmers in remote regions in which there is little flexibility? Such farmers face abject misery as a result of the Government's actions. The Government's record over the past seven months consists of the following: the limit in the total of the OTMS; the failure to implement a green pound compensation scheme; the failure properly to update the HLCAs; the failure to negotiate a proper clean beef marketing scheme; and last week's hammer blow of banning beef on the bone, despite the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee's alternative suggestions. What comfort can the Minister provide today for beef farmers? Will the Government negotiate on their behalf on agenda 2000, so that they will still be in business in the year 2000?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will take those points in reverse order. I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that if last weeks' action had not been taken, beef farmers in remote areas would have suffered even more damage. [HON. MEMBERS: "Rubbish!"] Yes they would. The decisions announced last week—about which we are consulting urgently this week—were taken to improve consumer confidence and to reassure consumers that British beef is absolutely safe. We were right to take that action and to publish SEAC's advice and recommendations. SEAC made more than one recommendation, as the hon. Gentleman knows, and it was the Government's responsibility to decide what action to take. We freely place that on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You made the wrong choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not think that we made the wrong choice. I invite the hon.Gentleman to offer a sacrifice—the extra person who would die of new variant CJD next year as a result of us not taking this action. Let him offer the name of someone as a sacrificial lamb. He would not do that, of course,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
because deep down he is prepared to put public health first. He will not, however, stand up and say that. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman invited me to comment on SEAC's proposals—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order, I would like to hear the Minister's answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that everyone has rushed out to buy beef on the bone. At the moment it is perfectly okay to do that because it is perfectly legal to sell it. We are considering banning the practice on the grounds of public health and because we want to restore consumer confidence. Having received advice we recognised that there was risk—it was more than a theoretical risk—and we had to take action. We were offered various choices. For example, meat could have been de-boned in cutting plants and abattoirs, but that was not a practical proposition. It would have involved a huge cost on public expenditure and it would not have been consistent with the level of risk, which, I agree, is very low. Our policy is to trust the retail butchers, and we believe that we can do so.<br><br>
Another possibility was to take the bone out of beef from cattle aged between 24 and 30 months, but that would have made it impossible for consumers to know the age of the beef. The only way that we could guarantee to the consumer at the retail end that the meat that they were buying was safe was to ensure that there were no bones in it. It is as simple as that. No one eats—</span></p>
<p>11.46 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister was asked a long question, and he is part of the way through a long answer. Regrettably, however, we have reached the end of question time. Many questions have been asked, but Committee members obviously have further questions, and I regret that we have not had time to hear them all.<br><br>
We now have until 1.15 pm for debate. I intend to call the Minister no later than 1.5 pm, which will give him at least 10 minutes to respond to the debate. An amendment in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) has been selected.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 9984/97, <i>Agenda 2000,</i> as it relates to reform of the Common Agricultural Policy; and supports the Government's objective of a market-oriented CAP with less emphasis on production-related agricultural support and more emphasis on targeted environmental and rural objectives.—[<i>Mr. Rooker.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
The Minister has given wholly unsatisfactory responses to many pertinent questions about the future of the beef industry in Europe in the year 2000. I shall discuss some of the issues that he raised and explain why we tabled the amendment.<br><br>
I must, with respect, draw the Minister's attention to the amendment's first line. The Opposition have a proud record, and we have taken the lead in advocating reform of the CAP. The Minister should re-examine the comments that my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) made when he was Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. My right hon. Friend knows of the leading role that we played during discussions on the MacSharry proposals. We sought to safeguard the interests of British farmers—especially the smaller farmers—who today doubt whether the Government will take a firm stance over the question of modulation. William Waldegrave initiated discussions in the Conservative party about a comprehensive review of the CAP, and other Conservative Members who have served as the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have acknowledged the need for reform. We need no lessons from the Minister: we are committed to a more market-based, common agricultural policy. I resent the way that the Minister criticised our proud record on that matter.<br><br>
With regard to Britain's beef industry, which is the more central issue, the Minister tried to bluff and bluster and to give tea and sympathy. He tried to suggest that the Government have a caring, listening attitude to those who—in the case of many hill livestock farmers—are the poorest people in this land. About 50 per cent. of those farmers have an income of less than £10,000 a year. The Government talk about welfare to work and about keeping people in the labour market, but their agricultural policy is designed to have precisely the opposite effect. Their inactivity is unbelievable. Put simply, as so many of my right hon. and hon. Friends elucidated earlier in their questions, if the Government do not act—and act quickly—it will be no use talking about agenda 2000 and the beef industry, because there will not be a beef industry.<br><br>
We have had a justification for the amendment. In response to one of my hon. Friend's questions about the restructuring of the beef industry in Europe, the Minister seemed to be hellbent on allowing the British beef industry, in reducing its size, to take the entire burden of that restructuring. Unless the Minister makes a clear statement to beef farmers, they will believe that that is the Government's attitude.<br><br>
I remind the Minister that the Chancellor of the Exchequer passed over to the Governor of the Bank of England the job of setting interest rates. The Chancellor's monetary policy since 1 May has driven the pound higher and has caused further revaluations of the pound. It is his Government's economic policy that has resulted in farmers wilting under a weight of imports, not only of beef, but of chicken. Indeed, imports of just about every agricultural item that can be imagined are flooding into the country; we are the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
sink of Europe for agricultural products. In the meantime, farmers have chosen to do a very un-British thing—to demonstrate. The Government then say, "Under duress, we are not moving". The Minister has not defined what he means by "duress".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Macclesfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has drawn attention to the Minister's condemnation of British farmers adopting what has hitherto been a French activity—demonstrating. Whenever French farmers have demonstrated, they have usually won what they want. British farmers are reluctantly adopting a European technique —demonstration—to draw attention to their severe plight. Every sector of British farming is currently in depression. That has never been the case in my lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I should like to make my party's position absolutely clear for the Minister, who has a nasty habit of giving partial quotations of what I said.<br><br>
I made it clear in every media interview that I gave on the subject that my party does not condone or support illegality. My party understands, however, why farmers who are not being listened to by the Government will want tangibly to show how strongly they feel.<br><br>
There are tens of thousands of farmers who are sitting fearfully in the hills and in their farms. It is not they who the Minister says are giving the Government duress. It is they who are frightened about whether they will wake up to a letter from the bank manager tomorrow, pointing out how borrowings and interest rates have increased, and that so far the bank has not heard any hint from the Government that they will be giving some help.<br><br>
What do farmers do? The Minister says that the Government are not going to be able to do anything under duress. He does not define duress. What does he expect? Will he tell us that the farmers must now withdraw from the ports for a specified period, and then something will happen? That could become a cyclical operation, in which the Government say, "No duress; we are listening", and absolutely nothing happens. Inactivity is not a solution to the problem. Unless the Government act to help the beef industry emerge from under the tidal wave of imports, there will not be a beef industry to discuss in the context of agenda 2000.<br><br>
The Minister asks from where the money is to come to help the beef industry. I should like to supply the Minister with some detail with which he clearly does not want to engage. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recently found £400 million in his Budget. He announced to the House of Commons that it came from underspends on Community expenditure. Some of that money must have come from underspending on farm-based activity.<br><br>
I do not want to take one penny from pensioners, but I am worried that in 1998 the situation will recur. The National Farmers Union confirmed that there are underspends on cereals, on livestock and on dairy produce. If that is so, our Fontainebleau rebate in 1998 will increase. The Treasury has confirmed that it will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0141">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
increase by 50p every pound that we do not spend. Will the Minister engage intellectually with me on that point? Am I right or wrong? What are his estimates for expenditure in the three areas that I have mentioned? What has been budgeted for those areas? If he wants to win the argument, he must come clean by engaging on those points.<br><br>
The Minister could, at little cost, do away with the cut in hill livestock compensatory allowances. He could remove from farmers the £44 million extra on meat hygiene. He could take away the weight limit on the over-30-months scheme, which would give farmers £29 million. He could prevent his proposed cattle passport scheme from making a profit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no profit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh yes there is. I read a parliamentary answer last night that makes it clear that the running costs of the scheme are £15 million a year and that three million cattle will be involved. According to my elementary division, that makes £5 each, not the £5 to £10 range that the Minister has talked about. The Conservative Government said that they would not bill farmers with the £13 million cost of establishing the scheme. If the Minister had anything to him, he would say that the Government would relieve hard pressed beef farmers from the cost of establishing a system designed to help them to stay in business. Those are the facts, as confirmed by the Minister's boss, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.<br><br>
The Minister tells us that from 1 January animals coming into the UK will have to adhere to the requirements of beef sold here. Will he clarify how an over-30-months scheme can be imposed on every non-UK source of beef? That is what he has said. What international deals have been done to secure that breakthrough? Beef farmers might be very interested in the idea that animals over 30 months old will not come into the UK.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that his Government introduced that scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, we introduced the over-30months scheme, but the Minister said—and I will be the first to apologise if I have made an error—that animals coming into this country would have to adhere to the over-30-months scheme. That is different from animals from the United Kingdom sources being restricted to such a scheme. Will the Minister clarify the point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I have been asked about this before. The previous Government introduced this system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the previous Government introduced it, but can he tell us what it is?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The restriction on beef that is over 30 months old coming into the UK.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has created a doubt that I shall pursue through parliamentary questions.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
The Minister has been fond of outlining why there will still be a beef industry for agenda 2000 to deal with. Is he saying that the £1.5 billion spent on dealing with a public health issue arising from the findings of Professor Pattison, chairman of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, should not have been spent? Is he saying that farmers should not have received that money because they were part of the public health solution? Does he agree that dealing with a public health issue is different from dealing with a tidal wave of imports that is destroying our beef industry? Will the Minister come clean and stop giving the impression that £1.5 billion spent on public health is a solution to the beef industry's current problems?<br><br>
I am fed up with hearing the Minister tell us that the Conservatives did not act competently, thoroughly, efficaciously and quickly to deal with BSE. I refer him to comments made in 1989 by Professor Southwood after his in-depth report on BSE was published. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We greatly welcome the speed with which the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has brought forward regulations based on veterinary evidence and on our recommendations."</p></blockquote>
That was the approach of Conservatives when we had responsibility for dealing with the matter. We did not put public health at risk. The Minister knows that science on BSE has been evolving and it is inevitable that there have been changes of policy over that time. We never put public health at risk by not heeding scientific advice; my quote from Professor Southwood's letter is solid evidence of what he did.<br><br>
Agenda 2000 is a fundamental contribution to the debate on reform of the common agricultural policy. We support its general lines, but I invite my right hon. and hon. Friends and any Opposition Members who are concerned about the interests of their farming communities to support our amendment. If we do not take action now to protect our beef industry, there will be no beef industry for agenda 2000 to deal with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Professor Southwood's committee warned in 1989 of a possible link between BSE and CJD and said that the response was inadequate.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman said that the Opposition had been very active when in Government, but I remember that the then Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), appeared in the newspapers week in, week out as the most bungling man in the western hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have to deal with the second matter because my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal was not a bungling man and I have never heard anyone say anything so stupid about my right hon. Friend.<br><br>
On CJD, with respect to the hon. Gentleman, he should read what Professor Pattison said. He was chairman of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee when a link was made between new form CJD and BSE. The science has been evolving and no one could say that when the BSE agent was first
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0142">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
identified there was a complete solution. That is why the previous Government spent so much money trying to salvage the beef industry.<br><br>
I respectfully point out to the hon. Gentleman that until Professor Pattison's finding, the previous Government kept the beef market in Europe open for our farmers. There is a difference between the present Government's rhetoric and their failure to lift the beef ban, and their performance has been lamentable.<br><br>
My task was to move the amendment, and I hope that I have illustrated why we should not take note of the document until the Government come clean, stop playing fast and loose with the anxieties and distress of beef farmers and state bluntly what they will do to help.</span></p>
<p>12.3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall resist the temptation to range far and wide from the strict agenda of our debate and concentrate my comments on the proposition before us—agenda 2000 and the way in which it affects the common agriculture policy.<br><br>
Let me say at the outset that I do not subscribe to the mantra that the common agriculture policy can be reformed. Politicians who talk of reform delude themselves and those whom they represent. The reality is that under qualified majority voting, this country has only 10 votes out of 87 and it is highly unlikely that we shall be able to assemble the requisite number of votes for some of the major changes that this country wants and needs. Any fundamental reform of the common agriculture policy requires unanimity, which is almost out of the question, given that certain countries have an almost pathological objection to what is proposed in the agenda 2000 programme.<br><br>
To illustrate that point, the annexe attached to the explanatory memorandum mentions significant premium increases for suckler cows, young bulls and steers. That enormous source of British beef has been left out of the equation. The Minister and members of the Committee will know that young heifers have provided a huge amount of excellent British beef. There was support for beef heifers before the introduction of the current subsidy regime for beef cattle.<br><br>
The suggestion was that we could persuade our partners in Europe that our way of supporting agriculture was the best. Inevitably, we lost the argument. We are discussing the reinforcement of a regime that suits the majority of continental agricultural industries and which, in this regard, is the antithesis of our understanding of those industries. The question must be asked: why have the Government failed once again to include in the proposals emanating from Brussels a mention of that important sector of the beef industry? It has been disadvantaged for several years and looks set to be further disadvantaged with the increase in premium on young bulls and steers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
A fortnight ago in this Committee I asked who determines quality. Why should the Commission decide that the only animals worthy of support or encouragement are young bulls and steers? The Commission does not support young heifers, which have been a source of excellent beef in this country for a long time.<br><br>
Expansion of the EU seems to be accepted by all parties. I shall confine my remarks to the effect of the CAP on central and east European countries. I want to know whether it is right to inflict on emerging countries the inefficiencies, disturbance and opportunities for fraud and corruption of a policy which is economically, morally and practically—I speak as a practical man—bankrupt.<br><br>
The extension of the CAP to the countries of central and eastern Europe will encourage the emergence of agri-business people to the detriment of traditional family farms. We saw that happen in this country. The small family farm—the traditional farmer—is under the greatest threat, which was an inevitable consequence of the policies inflicted on our agriculture by the CAP. If the CAP is extended to the east it will accelerate the inevitable loss of jobs in agriculture.<br><br>
The documents before us make it clear that a huge number of people are employed in agriculture in eastern European countries. That is in complete contrast to this country, where the CAP has resulted in there being scarcely any employed labour on British farms. Most of the work on our farms is done by the farmer, the farmer's wife and family, with the use of contractors or part-time workers. It is rare to find employed labour on our farms. We shall inflict job losses on all those eastern bloc countries, where many people work on farms. What will people in the central and eastern European countries do when they lose their jobs in agriculture?<br><br>
Such developments will precipitate a crisis in the countryside, which will cause rural depopulation. Such depopulation will not be replaced—as it is in this country—by people choosing to move out of the towns and into the country and choosing to commute to their place of employment in urban areas, because the distances are much greater. There will be rural depopulation in, for example, Poland and Hungary.<br><br>
Those developments will put enormous pressure on the environment and they will cause ecological problems, as they have done in this country. As a Conservative Member, I have a fundamental difficulty with the fact that we shall, in effect, substitute a managed market for a market that is more responsive to supply and demand. As we saw with the CAP—and as the Court of Auditors reminds us each year—there will be massive opportunities for corruption and fraud—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Borrow <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Ribble)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming increasingly puzzled. The farmers whom I have spoken to about the CAP complain about the inefficiencies in small family farms on continental Europe, and they point out the efficiencies of British agriculture. They say that there should be a level playing field and that we should perhaps move in the direction that the hon. Gentleman described. Farmers have compared the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
small, inefficient family farms in continental Europe with the larger, more efficient family farms in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's comments but he must appreciate that the block on any serious reform of the CAP will come from other countries where there are more farmers farming small acreages than there are in this country. The gist of my remarks is that it is all very well to talk about reform, but how on earth will it be done?<br><br>
The second part of my thesis is that it is not clear why we should inflict that inefficient and expensive system on other countries. Do we have a policy of inflicting equal misery throughout the whole of Europe in response to the misery that farmers in this country are demonstrating about this week?<br><br>
Extending the CAP eastward will involve extra costs, but it will not add value. There is little evidence to suggest that the CAP has added value. It is the role of the commercial sector to add value; it is not the role of government, whether here in Parliament or in Brussels. Inevitably, the effect of government from those two centres has been to add cost rather than value to agricultural products. The relevant papers talk about adding value, but that is wishful thinking.<br><br>
Extending the CAP eastward will lead to higher levels of public expenditure and greater bureaucracy. I am sure that the hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) agrees that one of the most common complaints from farmers today is about bureaucracy. Many farmers in my constituency complain to me because they have made a mistake while filling in a form. Some years ago, I could have gone to the relevant Minister and said, "Look, my constituent, Mr. Giles, made a mistake on his form. Will you please put it right?" Years ago, that Minister would have said, "Yes, I shall investigate the case and, if what you allege is true, I shall put the matter right." That is more than the Minister dares to do today. He is hidebound by the CAP regulations, which means that he sticks rigidly to the rules. Why does he do so? Simply because if he does not do so, and if the European Commission can demonstrate that the rules were broken in the UK, the British taxpayer will face a massive fine, as was recently imposed for failure to adhere to the rules of the common agricultural policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to intervene, but I want to confirm precisely what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I have visited two regional service centres of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, so I know just how much paperwork farmers are required to fill in—they are completing it at midnight, not in usual office hours—and there is incredible rigidity in the system. We are duty-bound to take such a firm approach simply because we are at the mercy of Brussels. Where opportunities arise in the negotiations and reform programme to alleviate that, we shall take steps to do so. I pay tribute to a MAFF project under the previous Government to cut bureaucracy, but we still have a long way to go.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings me neatly to my final point. What we are witnessing today is quite unprecedented and novel in my lifetime—and I was born before the second world war. Out of sheer desperation, farmers are going to the barricades because they feel—although they may not have diagnosed the problem in the way that I am diagnosing it now—that politicians of all parties do not have the power to solve their problems. They are absolutely right. I no longer have any power in this place and I have little influence. The Minister does not have much power, and he has only such influence as he can exert in Brussels along with 14 other Agriculture Ministers.<br><br>
The farmer has reached the point of desperation. He feels that he cannot get satisfaction through the traditional, historic, democratic process of Parliament. I seriously warn the Committee, and anyone else who will listen, that if we continue to hand over responsibility for agriculture, fisheries and other matters to people who are unelected and unaccountable, the events of the past 10 days will be repeated and the UK will descend into anarcy. I do not want that to happen, which is why I warn Ministers and the Committee against extending this policy eastward. That would put millions of people in eastern Europe into a situation in which they, too, would find that the democracy that they were starting to enjoy—having broken away from Russian domination—was short-lived because they would have substituted the control of Moscow with the control of Brussels.</span></p>
<p>12.18 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Norfolk)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a rural and agricultural morning because some of us started the day by attending the Adjournment debate on the rural economy raised by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith). Interestingly, he was answered by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Chisholm). In Committee, we have debated agenda 2000 and reform of the CAP. Many hon. Members—Opposition Members in particular—have raised problems connected with that. Indeed, the Minister has admitted that there are problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) highlighted the problems relating to enlargement, especially if Poland and Hungary are in the first wave of countries that come into the European Union.<br><br>
Like many of us, I was speaking to farmers in my constituency last weekend. When I mentioned that I was a member of European Standing Committee A and that the Committee would be discussing the CAP, there was hollow laughter. It seemed to the farmers to be an unreal world. Many people think that farmers are always moaning about their lot and always taking from the taxpayer, but although those farmers had not gone out to demonstrate, they felt that they understood those who had done so and that they would not get to 2000. The Minister should leave this meeting aware of an enormous feeling among farmers, who are not exaggerating, that the industry has never been in such a state of crisis. That crisis is related not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0144">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
only to the narrow issue of beef, but to a raft of issues—some of which predate the Government; I am not enough of an idiot to think that problems were not created in the past. However, many people feel, unlike the Minister, that actions taken by the Government—in the Minister's Department and in the Treasury—have imposed major stresses. Those people are not exaggerating when they say that they will not be there in 2000.<br><br>
Many normal, placid farmers in my constituency feel so strongly that they may demonstrate publicly. That fact should bring home to the Minister how strong public opinion is. It is no good his saying that he is under duress. My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde has made the point that we do not support illegal action or violence. Nor do the majority of farmers, but some feel that they have no choice. If I were the Minister, I would find that point important. He and his colleagues must make a practical difference to farmers in the short term, as well as up to 2000.<br><br>
There is an irony in the decision made last week by MAFF to ban beef on the bone. That was a difficult decision. Ministers have a responsibility to make judgments about loss of life. That decision was almost the final straw for many farmers, but what is remarkable is the clear public opinion that the decision was not right. The Minister can test reaction by going to any supermarket in London or to the local butcher in my constituency. The shelves are bare. One cannot find an oxtail or a T-bone steak because they have been bought by people who have put them in their freezers.<br><br>
That action is not irresponsible, but it signals the public's opinion that the Government probably made the wrong decision. We—the previous Government and particularly the present one—have already lost the confidence of farmers, and the Minister may be about to lose the public's confidence too. In the fundamental area of health, the public believe that he got it wrong.<br><br>
There are major problems with agenda 2000 but the wider farming community and much of the public wonder whether we will ever get there. Without being xenophobic or ultra-nationalist, farmers who trade with our European neighbours are suspicious that the British beef industry simply will not exist. Average farm incomes have fallen 37 per cent. this year. What income will there be by 2000?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Gray <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Wiltshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will not mind if I correct an inaccurancy. Farm incomes have fallen not by 37 per cent. this year, but by 47 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simpson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend who merely reinforces my point. The Government must act quickly.</span></p>
<p>12.24 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having, in my previous incarnation, travelled widely in Europe, including eastern Europe, I wholeheartedly welcome the extension of the market and the Union further east to the new countries. They were bombarded for half a

century with propaganda to come and join the free world and I welcome their entry. However, we are faced with an abomination against God and man in the CAP. I shall give a few examples of how outrageous it has become.<br><br>
In 1995 the European Union spent £802 million on tobacco subsidies and then introduced the current campaign on tobacco advertising with crocodile tears. An incredible 657,000 tonnes of Greek peaches were ploughed into the ground in 1995. The CAP is in breach of the treaty of Rome because the three pillars of intervention—tariffs, barriers and subsidies—all contravene the treaty; that was confirmed by the House of Lords in a report a couple of years ago. I would like the Minister to explain the Government's opinion on that. My farmers bitterly resent the absurd bureaucracy which has reached Kafkaesque levels. In Denmark, 29,000 officials look after 29,000 farmers, which is absurd.<br><br>
The CAP ignores the fact that there is a daily market for food. It is totally production oriented. It is a ghastly parody of Gosplan and the COMECON and has failed. The CAP does not respect the fact that there is a daily market, which should be left to decide price and production.<br><br>
We have heard much about BSE. At the height of the BSE crisis last year, large exporters of beef who buy from my constituents were being rung every day by customers supplying the highest quality restaurants in France, Italy and Belgium asking if they could get round the ban. The amount of meat was significant—five to seven truckloads a week to France and Italy and three or four truckloads to Holland and Belgium. It should be left to people and the market to decide whether something is healthy.<br><br>
I wholeheartedly welcome the Minister's criticism of the CAP, but the Government's record in the past few months does not suggest that they understand that the market should be left to decide. Instead, we have seen panic reactions oriented to placating bossy media personalities who have significant radio and television time.<br><br>
Two weeks ago we debated the absurd burdens imposed on abattoirs by requiring them to remove the spinal cord and special offal from sheep meat. There is absolutely no justification for doing that on health grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Over 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fine. Over 12 months, but the cost is huge. I have talked to people who sell to abattoirs near the Welsh border and they do not see how they can get through the next 12 months. I would like a reply from the Minister this morning on his prediction of how many abattoirs will close during the next 12 months, following the Government's absurd over-reaction which resulted from a media panic.<br><br>
Nothing could be more ludicrous than last week's measure to ban beef on the bone. I went to Oswestry on Friday and to Ellesmere on Saturday. With one exception—only one customer of one butcher has turned down Christmas orders—there has been a rush and deep-freezes will be stuffed full of ribs and T-bone

steaks. I bought two large ones and they were excellent. The risk is minimal. One newspaper reported that the risk of contracting CJD—there is no proven scientific link between BSE and CJD—is one in 600 million. Can you believe it, Mr. O'Hara. One is more likely to drown in the bath—the risk is one in 800,000. Let us consider something really hairy and dangerous such as flying in an aeroplane. The risk of dying in an aeroplane is one in 20,000. Will the Government go to Heathrow and incinerate aeroplanes? What about road accidents? Driving is a rough activity that kills one in 8,000. Flu kills one in 5,000.<br><br>
The Government are panicking: clever manipulation by a few professors has created a health scare completely out of proportion to the real risk. That is fundamental to the issue under discussion. Farmers in my constituency believe in free and fair trade in healthy, safe products.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Borrow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Fylde mentioned earlier how, under the previous Conservative Government, scientific evidence continually changed on BSE and CJD, which meant that Government policy continually changed on what was available for consumption. The hon. Gentleman seems to be taking the line that because we only know so much now, we should take the side of risk rather than the side of caution. Has what happened under the previous Government not taught him anything?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) proceeds, I should like to remind him that the debate is about the common agricultural policy. The current state of the British beef industry is of course relevant, and I must allow much reference to it, but the debate is not about BSE.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very well taken, Mr. O'Hara. The decision was made in Europe; it was not the Government's decision to ban beef.<br><br>
The debate is about healthy food. What drives my farmers to participate in major demonstrations—1,000 went to Bridgnorth on Sunday, and many went to Holyhead, peacefully—is the fact that food, specifically pork and chicken products, is coming into the country from mainland Europe, where—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Via Holyhead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is via Holyhead, perhaps Felixstowe, I do not know where. Those products are coming in with no guarantee that the pigs and chickens have been fed with materials that are safe. It is commonly acknowledged that throughout Europe, meat and bonemeal are still being fed in countries where it is known anecdotally that BSE exists. Statistically it must exist in those countries. That is not free and fair trade. That is why farmers in my constituency are so furious. They are furious that the Government are doing nothing about it. What will the Government do about potentially risky food coming into the country? That is a fundamental question.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
The beef industry in in crisis. That is clear from the figures. A farmer told me this morning that he receives about 87p a pound deadweight for top class beef. To break even, he needs to receive about 100p a pound. Beef producers cannot continue at that rate. I should like a prediction from the Minister of how many beef farmers will remain unless he takes action against unfair trade in unhealthy meat products.<br><br>
It is no good talking merely about beef products from which spines and specified bovine offal have been removed by countries whose regimes are, I suspect, nothing like as rigid as ours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In Sennybridge market in February 1996, beef prices ranged from £1.01 to £1.42 per kilogram. They have not dropped to the range 58p to 90p, which emphasises my hon. Friend's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right; that was a most helpful intervention. There are some areas of the country—we have seen it in Wales—in which beef farming is the only option.<br><br>
The Minister cannot leave without giving the Committee a clear answer about how he will handle imports that are not competitive, from places where abattoirs are not as rigidly maintained, and where dodgy foodstuffs are fed to pigs and chickens. It is no good harping on about beef. Different types of meat are in competition with each other.<br><br>
We have hardly touched on the subject of milk. Again, we are back in the Kafkesque world in which there is a huge market. The world market for milk products is increasing in a dead straight line at a rate of about 10 per cent. a year.<br><br>
I used to travel widely in the far east, where many Chinese people regarded products such as cheese and yoghurt as disgusting. That has changed, and demand has increased substantially.<br><br>
In my constituency, a company called Müller—which used to be a tiny family business based in Bavaria—created yoghurts that looked good and that people wanted to eat. Surprisingly, the company has been successful, and has invested £50 million in my constituency. Müller has bought the biggest creamery in eastern Europe, in Leppersdorf, near Dresden. That creamery processes milk from the south-east German milk field, and suspect that it will go on to process milk from the Czech Republic and other areas. Müller has proved that it is possible to create a market for dairy products: Gosplan does not prevail, the market is elastic and it is expanding. The proposal is hopeless because it takes such a pessimistic view of the future.<br><br>
I will quote one of my constituents, to whom I spoke even earlier this morning at about 6.30 am, and who has invested about £1 million in a large dairy unit: about 950 cows, producing three million litres a year. I hope, Mr. O'Hara, you will excuse my constituent's blunt Shropshire language. He said,
<br><blockquote><p>"In a bloody supply controlled economy, our market stagnant and non competitive, we are absolutely knackered."</p></blockquote>
Later in the conversation, he said,
<br><blockquote><p>"We have got to go to a free market as soon as possible. This industry is totally hamstrung."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
It is not acceptable for highly enterprising and skilful people such as my constituent to be restricted to producing 85 per cent. of the UK's needs alone, and to be unable to export. The market must work because—the suppliers in my area are too canny to let me know the exact figure—the Müller factory pays over the odds.<br><br>
Milk prices have decreased dramatically: last year they were probably 23p or 24p a litre, now they are at 19p or 20p a litre. Much is made of the world price, but Europe is overwhelmingly the largest milk producer. Europe produces approximately 120 million tonnes of milk, compared with 68 million tonnes in the United States, 9 million tonnes in New Zealand and 8 million tonnes in Japan. The Soviet Union produces about 80 million tonnes. Although everyone harps on about the New Zealand price, which is 11 p, 12p or 13p a litre, depending on the quality, I suggest that the world price, which currently prevails in eastern Europe, is about 17p. That is approximately the price in the United States. Cheese produced in the United States has a cut-off price of about 17p if an exchange rate of between $1.65 and $1.68 to the pound sterling—which has prevailed during the past month—is applied.<br><br>
It is clear that the quota regime will be redundant in a few years' time: the price in eastern Europe and the price in the UK will merge. In the interests of the big, successful Shropshire farmers, I want the Government to assure me of what they will do about the quota regime when it becomes redundant and that its complexities and costs will not extend eastwards. As each farm already has its own established quota, the additional quota probably has a value of about 3p to 4p a litre. Successful Shropshire farmers are therefore already producing milk at world prices, but will they be allowed to do so after agenda 2000 without a quota regime? The document's proposals are weak.<br><br>
I am fully aware that other hon. Members would like to speak. I would like to finish by saying that I concur completely with my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow. The demonstrations of the past week are most regrettable, but they occurred only because no democratic mechanism remains for people to make a sensible protest. It is hopeless for farmers in my constituency to consult me about serious agricultural matters. It is hopeless for me to write to the Minister as he has no power—he only has 10 votes out of 87. A progressive breakdown in law and order will occur as a result.<br><br>
There is already extreme frustration. By a complete coincidence, I received a letter from one of my constituents last night who wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have to produce to the highest possible standards of hygiene, quality, and animal welfare as set down by our purchasers in the knowledge that they can purchase the same product from abroad with nothing like the same quality assurance. I complain very strongly at the urban political correctness that the Government seem to want to impose upon us."</p></blockquote>
That raises two issues: the feeling that the Government are against the countryside and do not understand its problems, and the dramatic crisis regarding beef. That was shown this morning by the turnout of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
Conservatives and the pathetic turnout of the Labour party, which professes to have won the hearts of the countryside. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where were they?"] They were not here. The Minister must realise that unless the Government take decisive action on healthy food imports, there will be more demonstrations. I take no pleasure in predicting that, but I have lived all my life in Shropshire and I know how badly people are doing, how right their cause is, and how feeble the Government's reaction has been.</span></p>
<p>12.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: About 90 per cent. of our long debate has been about beef. I represent the dales and hills of Finchley and Golders Green, and questions raised by people there are more consumer-oriented than production-oriented. The previous Government were biased towards producers. The new Government's balance between producers and consumers is highly admired in Finchley and Golders Green, where concern for the consumer is greater.<br><br>
While industry-led questions are important, I am surprised that the Conservatives do not seem to give any thought to those who have suffered or died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. They appear not be worried about that. That is because of the number of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease known in medical records. However, although the records may not identify hundreds of people, the medical records may not have been properly noted. I have been to meetings and can give the names of those who chaired those meetings to anyone who is interested. There may be evidence, hidden at the moment, that hundreds of people have died. No one wants to tell the press that hundreds of people have died, but that fear is in our minds.<br><br>
Earlier, Mr. O'Hara, you interrupted me to say that we should be talking about the two documents on a stronger and wider Union and the challenge of enlargement. Both documents look to the future. Conservative Members have carped about the past and have become directionless. They take no responsibility for the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951; we could have had just the same arguments about coal and steel just 10 years ago. They take no responsibility for not signing up in 1958. They take no responsibility for having had no influence when the CAP was created by article 39 in 1961. It is ludicrous of the hon. Member for North Shropshire to assume that the CAP goes against the treaty of Rome because it was not a part of the treaty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why, then, did the House of Lords declare that in a report two years ago?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will send me the quotation to which he refers so that I can put it right.<br><br>
We finally joined in 1973. It was then that the Conservative Government should have had some influence. They should have said that the UK would join only if the superior British agriculture policy was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
adopted. British policy was superior to the French-oriented policy that we inherited. That cost this nation dear. We had to change from our superior policy to the inferior CAP.<br><br>
Of course, having failed to sign in 1958, we went to the Community, on our hands and knees, in 1962 and were even closer to the ground when we returned in 1968. We had absolutely no influence when we finally joined in 1973. Having forgone our chance in 1958, we might have had some influence in 1961. We might have said, "Let's have our better policy, not the Franco-oriented policy." Who in the end designed the single market? It was designed by Lady Thatcher—who previously represented the constituency of Finchley—at roughly the same time as the outbreak of BSE.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I am at a loss to understand what on earth this interesting ramble about, and rewriting of, the ancient history of the European Union has to do with the subject before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis) is providing a context in which he will discuss the matter that we should be discussing—namely, proposals for the reform of the CAP, in principle and in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I shall repeat some significant dates. In 1958, the European Economic Community was created—you may remember that, Mr. O'Hara. The year 1961 is associated with article 39 and the CAP—which is exactly what you instructed me to discuss, Mr. O'Hara. In 1973, we joined the CAP and, in that context I discussed the superiority of the British agricultural policy over the CAP policy. In 1986, the single market began, and it, too, is associated with the CAP; BSE also began at that date.<br><br>
I agreed with the hon. Member for Ludlow when he said that when eastern European countries, including Poland, join, there will be rural depopulation. I shall go further and give my personal opinion: I am not in favour of Poland or of any other eastern European country joining, but I do favour Cypress joining—it is a potential powder keg. We would be in deep trouble if the eastern European countries joined the present CAP regime. If it is not changed before those countries join, there will be a fracas.<br><br>
I disagree with the suggestion of the hon. Member for Ludlow that rural depopulation in eastern Europe may occur because there is a managed market. More people could be retained in rural Poland under a managed market. Rural depopulation would occur much more quickly in Poland under a free market. However, the managed market would be much more expensive. Those eastern European countries are very different—they have less industry, fewer services and more agriculture.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) rightly said that one can no longer find beef on the bone in shops. If so, that must be good for farmers. If such beef cannot be found demand for it will be high and the supply will rise. The Opposition cannot have it both ways.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, as of next week, farmers will no longer be able to sell beef on the bone, and the fact that shops are now empty is of no relevance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the hon Gentleman's economics, but something may happen next week.<br><br>
As I understand the argument of the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk, he complained on behalf of small farmers and said nothing was left in the shops. He said that many people have not accepted the decision taken by the Government last week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should complete our discussion on the basis of the facts. About 95 per cent. of beef is already sold off the bone, and last week's decision affects only 5 per cent. of beef that is sold. Our announcement will not stop farmers from selling meat on the bone because that meat is removed at the retail end by butchers and caterers and in shops. We should not get the matter out of proportion—only 5 per cent. of beef that is sold is affected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My final comment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with what the Minister has just said? Does he agree that the fact that only 5 per cent. of beef is sold on the bone justifies the introduction of a ban to prevent people from enjoying that commodity? That is not a proper argument. Does not he think that the decision to buy beef on the bone should have been left to the consumer, which was one of the options proposed by SEAC?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman quoted incorrectly. I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister, who did not use the word "only" when he said 5 per cent. It is the Government's responsibility, even with SEAC's recommendations, to take the direction that they believe is right. I back their decision on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman think that the Government have made complete fools of themselves? They have imposed a ban. British consumers, from all political parties, have used their common sense and gone out, en masse, to buy beef on the bone. Is not this an absurd example of the nanny state panicking and taking the most extreme option presented by SEAC, just to avoid a sticky interview on the "Today" programme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That intervention is out of order. It takes us further from the matter in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.<br><br>
My final point relates to what the hon. Member for North Shropshire said about a Minister without power. We have 10 votes out of 87. The Opposition's attitude is the same as ever. The Government's attitude is that we are part of those 87 votes. We are at meetings to convince, not to compete or to douse the voices of other member states. We are there with 10 votes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hayes <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Holland and The Deepings)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire made his point, the Minister was the first to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
intervene and agree with him. The Minister jumped up—hastily, in my judgment—and admitted that he had no power and that his hands were tied by Brussels. Are his hands tied by Brussels or not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, my hon. Friend the Minister gave the answer that we have 10 votes. The correct social and economic response is that we have 10 votes which we marry with the other 77 votes so that we do business together. That is how the Government deal with the European Economic Community.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire demonstrates the old Euro-scepticism which has been the undertone of the Committee's three or four meetings. It is the bedrock on which Opposition Members make their decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said earlier that he did not agree with expanding the European Union eastwards. That is a challenging statement to make in this Committee or in Parliament at this time. It is not the Government's policy. Will he comment on that? If he believes that it is right for him to express his opinions, why is it wrong for others to express their opinions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would never say that anyone should not express what they feel or their opinions. I believe that countries such as Poland should fulfil not just certain democratic conditions, but other conditions before they qualify for the Maastricht convergence criteria. That is all I had in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I have clashed on our interpretation of Europe several times in the Committee. I stress again my experience and view. I believe in a wide Union—a club—of independent sovereign states working for free trade. I have spent my whole life in international trade. I speak two other European languages and I am currently president of my trade association—it irritates the hon. Gentleman whenever I say that. I am trying to bring in east European members, and I am making some progress in Slovenia. So I bitterly resent the accusation that I am anti-Europe. I favour a wide Europe, but I am anti a nasty little bureaucratic clique.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis) responds, I must inform the Committee that I shall be calling the Minister in 10 minutes and I would like to call two more hon. Members before that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the speech of the hon. Member for North Shropshire reveals his Euro-scepticism. He says that he is in favour of a wide Europe, but continental Europe, and the present membership of the EU, are in favour of deepening Europe, which he does not favour at all. Many Government Members are in favour of deepening and widening Europe at the same time. The hon. Gentleman wants more or less the same thing, because if we widen and widen Europe, to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
include Russia and the Ukraine, then it becomes impossible to deepen Europe at all. That is really the difference.<br><br>
The Government are not against the countryside. The cities, towns and countryside must live together. That is the Government's objective. The Government have never passed any legislation or pressed any notions that are against the countryside.</span></p>
<p>12.56 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to intertwine the points that have been raised in relation to agenda 2000 with the present crisis in livestock, because an important point of logic is involved. It is difficult to proceed with the wider reform of the CAP when, by an unfortunate coincidence, the agenda 2000 proposals contain specific measures on the livestock sector, which is going through a serious crisis. Does not the Minister agree that there is a danger that the proposals suggested in the document, which are designed to bring about structural reform in the livestock sector, may be unilaterally absorbed by farmers in this country?<br><br>
We have heard figures comparing and contrasting the severe collapse in meat prices in several markets around the country. I see this speech as my peaceful protest. Having been visited on Saturday by a small delegation of farmers—40 farmers in my somewhat confined surgery—I take this opportunity peacefully to express the severe difficulties that their industry faces. Is the Minister aware of the assessment by the National Farmers Union of the impact that these proposals will have on the beef industry? It calculates that the gross impact on the industry will be 776 million ecu, or £400 million. If that calculation is adjusted to take account of the lower feed costs that will also result from the agenda 2000 proposals, it still results in a cost to the UK beef industry of £89 million at a time when the industry cannot afford to take such a loss.<br><br>
There will be additional costs for the farmer as a result of the Government's decisions, including an additional £37 per head in rendering costs. Those costs are not replicated elsewhere in the EU and they distort the level playing field. In addition, there is a basic cost of £1.50 per head for tagging cattle. There is also some discussion of introducing cattle passports, the precise cost of which is still unknown, but farmers believe it will be substantial.<br><br>
Problems in the livestock sector are aggravated by depression in the price of milk. Under the agenda 2000 proposals, support for milk prices should see a 10 per cent. cut. I am sure that the Minister is aware that market prices are already substantially down. Some of the farmers who visited me on Saturday supply to the Co-op, which is well known for providing a premium price to the market but which is talking about making a 25 per cent. cut. That anticipates the sort of cut referred to in agenda 2000.<br><br>
It is clear that prices in the livestock sector have a knock-on effect on ancillary industries serving agriculture. I was particularly struck to learn last weekend that the Massey Ferguson factory near
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
Coventry and my constituency has suffered an 82 per cent. reduction in UK sales this year. That will obviously affect local employment opportunities. Hire contractors in my constituency experience the crisis in another way. Farmers in the livestock sector can no longer afford to hire equipment.<br><br>
The agenda 2000 proposals want to give priority to rural development, but the rural economy is facing the loss of jobs among the firms that serve it. Those losses are not just changes in employment statistics; jobs lost in agriculture result in removal from the rural community of skilled craftsmen who are respected in their local community. They are not simply a job statistic.<br><br>
Improved competitiveness is the declared aim of agenda 2000, but as a result of imports British farmers are losing the ability to compete. They cannot export and they suffer the indignity of subsidised imports coming into this country. The NFU tells us that Irish beef receives national aid to the tune of £41 per head, and it is significant to note that 47 per cent. of beef imports to this country come from Ireland.<br><br>
Another declared objective of agenda 2000 is to guarantee the safety of food. The British experience of dealing with the evolving science of BSE has shown how difficult it is to guarantee that. The Minister said earlier that he would ensure that beef imported to this country would be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny as domestic beef must undergo. How will he guarantee that beef imported from Uruguay is subject, for example, to an over-30 months scheme? What powers do the Government have to ensure that beef imported to this country is as safe as British beef?<br><br>
Those are inconsistencies that must be resolved before the future of the common agriculture policy can be discussed in the sort of detail that agenda 2000 requires. I support the amendment not because Conservatives want to block reform of the common agriculture policy, but because the issues in the livestock industry must be solved first.</span></p>
<p>1.2 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Borrow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall keep my speech short as I am mindful of the time. The amendment refers specifically to the beef industry and the problems of BSE. It is crucial that the Government look into the history of how we got to where we are; I am mindful that the former hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie) seemed to imply that the previous Government handled the matter less than satisifactorily. I am certainly interested in finding out how it was handled by the previous Government because that is at the heart of the problems in the beef industry at the moment.<br><br>
Turning to the substance of the matter before us—agenda 2000 and the common agriculture policy—it is important to recognise, as many Conservative Members do not, that there is not usually a completely free market in agriculture. The tradition in most countries is a market that is regulated to recognise the elasticity of demand for agricultural produce and the need to cope with surpluses and deficits in agricultural production. The state, or an organisation within it,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
usually has a duty to manage that. As members of European Union, we want a level playing field and open markets throughout the union, and the EU organises that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Borrow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way as I have only a minute left.<br><br>
I want to refer to the comments made by the hon. Members for Ludlow and for North Shropshire about the democratic deficit in decisions made by the European Union. I am something of a maverick on that issue. There is a democratic deficit, but rather than simply saying that we do not like it, we should ask what we need to do to make sure that the Union has a democratic structure. I would have direct election of the people who run the EU rather than the present system. That idea does not enjoy the support of Government or Opposition Front Benchers; but simply to stand on the sidelines and say that we do not like the system and its democratic deficit is no solution to the problem.</span></p>
<p>1.5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is worth remembering that ours is the only one of the 15 European Parliaments that discusses European measures in the way that we do. Our system may be defective in some ways, but it is a big improvement on what happened until about five years ago. Our system is also superior to that in any other EU Parliament. If other Parliaments allowed their Ministers to be scrutinised by Members of Parliament, that would be a first port of call in reducing the democratic deficit.<br><br>
I applaud the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) for being one of the few non-members of the Committee who were here this morning to have stayed to make a speech. It is right that Members should raise legitimate concerns and I would encourage all hon. Members to operate that way. The figures given by the hon. Lady are not dissimilar to my own. I mentioned £370 million and a gap of £80 million. She said £400 million and £89 million.<br><br>
She is right, too, that there is a knock-on effect for producers. She and I are midland Members and know that manufacturing industry can come under attack. There are successes there, however: a small firm not far from my area exported 200 ploughs to Japan last year, and that firm did not exist 25 years ago. That is a credit to the agricultural manufacturing industry of the west midlands.<br><br>
The hon. Lady and others, including the right hon. Member for Fylde, spoke about beef imported to the UK. We are on a learning curve, trying to find out what happened in the past. We have no access to the previous Government's papers, and that causes some difficulty. Nevertheless, Ministers ask far more questions of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food than Back Benchers do.<br><br>
The question of what comes into the UK is crucial. I intervened earlier on the right hon. Member for Fylde and have since checked that what I said was right. The Beef (Emergency Control) Order 1996
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
prohibited the sale for human consumption of any meat from cattle aged over 30 months. On 13 April 1996, the Conservative Government introduced the Beef (Emergency Control) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 1996, exempting from that restriction meat derived from animals slaughtered in certain third countries where no cases of BSE had been recorded. Those countries are outwith the European Union and I recall seeing a list of about 12 countries, including New Zealand and Australia and a couple in Africa and South America.<br><br>
In general, the 30-month rule applies to beef coming to the UK, especially from the EU. Countries are not required to take out their cattle aged over 30 months, as we do, or to destroy bone meal and tallow. However, last week's decision makes no change to what was introduced by the previous Government. How it will be policed in Europe is an interesting question. I do not know how the previous Government intended to police it, but from January next year we shall make every effort to do so. New restrictions about removing specified risk materials will come into force across Europe, and European beef and home-produced beef will be subject to the same conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way.<br><br>
Not all the work will necessarily be done abroad—it may be done in this country. We cannot stop the importation of beef that contains SRM, but it will have to be removed in this country before it is sold for human consumption. In the same way, beef on the bone can be imported if the conditions that will be applied from next week apply to it—it will have to be removed from the bone before it is available for public sale. That does not involve a beef import ban; what happens to the beef before the point of sale is the key. I place that important point firmly on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the rest of the world?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is not taking interventions—whether standing or sedentary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I alluded to the fact that there is a specified list of third countries that are exempt. There has never been any disagreement about that list. Those countries are tried and tested, and there is no risk of BSE. Europe is covered.<br><br>
I do not want to raise the temperature of our debate again, but I am not wholly convinced that we have has a full rebuttal of recent illegal activities. The Opposition have dropped lots of hints, and peaceful, lawful protest is to be applauded—in fact, I encourage it. Over the past week there have been illegal activities that have interfered with free trade.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Fylde and the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice)—both of whom are former Ministers—will know that one of our leading supporters over the past 15 months in our efforts to lift the beef ban in Europe was the Government of the Irish Republic. They have,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
without doubt, supported us all the way down the line. It is therefore wholly wrong for our farmers to pick on a country that has given us greater support than any other European country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall not give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. All Committee members have had plenty of opportunities to ask questions and to make speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also have to put on the record the fact that over the past few days some Opposition Members—not all of whom are here today—have implied in the media that we should wait for a pile of dead bodies before we act—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is not giving way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A weekend newspaper report about raw milk asked where were the dead bodies that justified consultation on banning a potentially harmful food product. The implication of the leaders in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and <i>The Guardian</i> is that we should knowingly allow infectivity into the food chain. That is the implication of allowing customers to choose.<br><br>
I must answer the legitimate point that has been raised in the press and discussed in the House in Committee this morning. It concerns tobacco and other products about which there is a health risk. The fact is that the Government do not know what the incubation period is of the new variant CJD in humans; nor do our scientific advisers or any Committee member. We do not know whether there will be an epidemic, but we pray to heaven that there will not be. We cannot knowingly let infectivity into the food chain because we do not know what the incubation period is. That is why we took our decision last week.<br><br>
I must point out to the hon. Member for North Shropshire and to the other Opposition Members who have raised that matter that if our top priorities were public health and consumer confidence in our food production, we had no choice—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The consumer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The consumer should not be allowed a choice when the Government are aware that infectivity with an unknown incubation period could enter the food chain. The Government, not the scientists, made the decision. We chose not to place infectivity in the food chain. We, not the scientists, are responsible for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What happens to the bits?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that if the bits stay in the bones, they will be destroyed. If they are cooked, they will come out in the juices.</span></p>
