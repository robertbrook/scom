	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr Maxton. Having served for some time on European Standing Committee A in the previous Parliament, I need your guidance on matters that may be of help to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Vote Office received notification at midday last Wednesday, 29 October, that two documents would be discussed this morning: Nos. 7310/97 and 10385/97. On Friday, which was a non-sitting Friday, without previous notification—the Vote Office staff assured me that they were surprised—four more documents were added to the list of papers to be discussed, namely Nos. 7192, 7594, 7611 and 7691. Members of the Committee, who were probably in their constituencies on a non-sitting Friday, would not have had an opportunity to pick up those papers until Monday. Furthermore, Mr. Maxton, you were sent two more copies of extra documents on Monday, which members of this Committee did not receive until Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it usual practice for a Department to be so rude as to provide a Committee with documents at such a late stage? That prevents hon. Members from scrutinising them fully and is a great impertinence not only to members of the Committee, but to you, Mr. Maxton, who must oversee with fairness the workings of the Committee. Will you send a letter of complaint about the incompetence of the Department of Trade and Industry, which resulted in important papers for discussion this morning being delivered at such a late stage to members of the Committee? I do not know whether they have read them, but certainly a few hon. Members will not have had the opportunity fully to scrutinise the papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek your ruling on the matter, Mr. Maxton, and wish to know whether you will complain not only on behalf of members of the Committee, but on your own behalf, about such rudeness and inefficiency on the part of the DTI?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a matter for the Chair. The provision of documents is a matter for the Department concerned. Documents should be provided to hon. Members as quickly as possible, but that is a matter for the particular Department and it is not a matter on which I can rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have ruled on the hon. Lady's point of order, but she may have a few more moments in which to make a further point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it be in order, Mr. Maxton, for you to complain to the Department about its lack of respect for the Committee? Although it is not your responsibility, you have been on the receiving end of such rudeness. I should like you to consider whether you will complain to the Department of Trade and Industry about it providing important documents to the Committee as late as yesterday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say no more other than that the matter is not one for the Chair. Obviously, it is more convenient if documents are provided on time to give members of the Committee an opportunity to examine them. The Minister may wish in his opening statement to comment on why the papers arrived in different batches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton. Will you use your influence to see whether documents which are available to the Select Committee could be made available to members of the Standing Committee? I believe that the Select Committee referred the matter to this Committee before the summer recess, so it should have been possible for the majority of the documents to have been made available to us during the summer recess. You may not have the power to order such action, Mr. Maxton, but members of the Committee would greatly appreciate it if you could use your influence to see whether such arrangements can be made in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Documents are available in the Vote Office even if they have not been sent to members of the Committee. As I said, this is not a matter for the Chair. I must tell Conservative Members that their points of order are eating into the time that we have to discuss the matters before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a new point of order, Mr. Maxton, of which I have given you notice. When finally we received the papers for scrutiny this morning, we were given a list of relevant documents. However, document 5874/97 is not mentioned in that list. Will you clarify that document's status? Are we scrutinising the document this morning, in which case the list is not in order, or has it been appended to the papers to be of use to the Committee? If so, can you say if and when it will come before the Committee for scrutiny?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I say that the list of documents is not a matter for the Chair. I assume that the document is included for the Committee's use but that, as it is not listed, it is not part of the formal discussion. As to when it will be debated, that is a matter for the Select Committee on European Legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. Having spent the better part of last night trying to absorb this material and finding it extraordinarily difficult to do so, and given your
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
helpful clarificatory ruling that, unfortunately, the Chair has no authority to command such papers to be ready on time—I assume that that must mean that the Committee could sit without any papers and that you would not be able to do anything about it—I should like to move that further consideration be adjourned, to give the Committee sufficient time to scrutinise these important documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The papers were available in the Vote Office for any hon. Member who wanted to obtain them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Science, Energy and Industry (Mr. John Battle)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton. Opposition Members have not yet learnt the rules of the game. In opposition, we learnt that, if we wanted papers in order to do our homework for a Committee, we had to go to the Vote Office to get them. I say to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) with the greatest respect that I, too, believe that hon. Members should have papers in time to scrutinise them properly for Committee. Conservative Members are now in opposition and no longer have the luxury of briefings on which their lines are written out. They are discovering that the Opposition have to do their own homework. The papers were available in the Vote Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have now fully discussed that point of order. I cannot take a motion for the Committee to adjourn as the House decided that we should sit this morning. I therefore call the Minister to make his statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this opportunity to discuss the European framework programme and the documents, which have been available in the Vote Office for some time so that hon. Members could read and assess them before we considered the matters before us today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is making a statement and so will not give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the usual procedure of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Scrutiny Committees of the House of Lords and the House of Commons for examining European Union proposals and legislation. It is important that we scrutinise work that is done elsewhere and have proper and full debates, as policy and legislation are formulated not only in this House but in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade and I met the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology to discuss the wider science picture. It is important that we occasionally focus on the policy area that is before us today, which I believe has not received the attention it deserves from the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The framework programmes date from the mid-1980s. The first was set up in 1984 and ran for three years. We are now in the midst of the fourth framework programme, which began in 1994 and runs until 1998. Discussions on the fifth framework programme started in the middle of 1996. I emphasise that, in those discussion, we are now one of 15 countries. We are negotiating for consensus, for a common position, so that we can take programmes forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we will concentrate on European research, technology and development. I attended the Council of Ministers on 15 May, some days after the general election, to start to tackle, as a new Administration, the Commission's proposals for the management of the programme, and to sharpen the focus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today is an especially opportune time to discuss the fifth framework programme as we are at a crucial point in negotiations. I am pleased to say that those negotiations are making reasonably good progress, but there is still a long way to go. The fifth framework programme gives us an opportunity to develop a new approach to framework programme research in Europe, but we must work hard to shape that programme and make it happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Research Council, which meets next week, we will tackle major issues relating to the structure and shape, the scientific and technological content and management—including user input—of the programme. We have also had initial exchanges on the budget, and how that might be broken down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can reach a common position at the February Council, during our presidency of the Council of Ministers. It would be good if we could sharpen up and agree on the programme. That will be a challenge because the timetable for completion is incredibly tight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before dealing with framework programme five in detail, I should like to say a few words about the current programme to spell out what it does. The framework programme funds collaborative research and technology development; it involves universities and companies engaged in science for more than one member state. It is aimed at improving industrial competitiveness, supporting Community policies in transport, the environment, energy and health. It is designed to fund strategic and applied research. It excludes what is now known as "near-market research", and basic curiosity-driven research. It covers all areas of science and technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth framework programme was divided into 18 sub-programmes, which were largely organised on traditional scientific and technological lines. They are multi-annual programmes that involve major expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that Britain has a strong participation, averaging more than 50 per cent., in such programmes. We have particular strengths in research in agriculture, transport, life sciences and advanced communication technologies, where the figure is as high as 70 to 80 per cent. We are delighted at the level of UK
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
participation—it is high, and we therefore want a strong say in how the programme proceeds. We can make good use of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British industry and universities feature strongly in the framework programme. I emphasise that small and medium-sized enterprises account for just over half of industry participants. It is therefore not only big companies which are involved. Figures for UK participants in the framework four programme are: 40 per cent. from industry; 39 per cent. from academia; 21 per cent. from research organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that the biggest share of funding goes to industry; the rest is shared between academia and research institutes. Of the proportion going to industry, small and medium-sized enterprises should benefit, given that we want a heightened focus on the work of those enterprises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme so far is a good reflection of the quality of UK research in the private and public sectors. We have contributed and made a strong input into the programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions are not taken during a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I make a statement and then hon. Members are free to ask me questions for some time before we open the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Addressing the future agenda, we must ensure that framework programme five is focused on key objectives of European importance. We must deliver results that will be, of value to European industry and society. That is why we want to emphasise the proposals for key actions and to bracket them so as to target research on specific and identified needs. Our approach to the definition of key actions has been to place particular importance on the criteria of added value and subsidiarity while giving weight to the notions of attractiveness and feasibility—tying in to the general themes that we want to see pushed further forward within Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are five programme areas about which consensus is emerging. In fact, the original programme—programme four—consisted of 18 areas. We are now sharpening the focus by suggesting larger brackets so as to include programmes on life sciences, environment, information society, production and transport technologies and energy. They would be the headline areas—the brackets—within a series of 20 key actions that would spell out a series of themes within the themes and get down to the detail of the nature of the programmes. For example, the study of food nutrients and health, the cell factory and questions of genetics, bio-medical and medical ethics could be sub-sets within the life-sciences programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim is to sharpen the programme into key actions so that there is a clear sense of structure. The programme's structure is essential; it must be coherent, accessible and manageable. We have doubts about the Commission's overall proposals on structure. We think that they are over-concentrated, and virtually all member states have said that that is not the way to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
manage the programme. They want a greater say in control and management as well as user involvement in the management structure. We have proposed a more appropriate structure based on the five programmes, around which we want to try to develop a consensus at the Research Council next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of the five programmes in not unlike the Foresight exercise, which, to be fair, took place under the previous Government. We want to energise that exercise and drive it forward using a series of brackets which can act as a thematic blender within the context of the fifth framework programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that those who use the results of the fifth programme—whether they be in industry, the scientific community or the public sector—are involved in defining the research that they need. We have pressed for that from the outset; users must be involved. A broad consensus is now emerging under which advisory groups of users of research should be set up for each of the programme's major areas. Their role would be to advise the Commission on detailed research priorities, strategically monitoring the programme as it proceeds. We hope that that will add to transparency, effectiveness and openness in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of member states in ensuring proper implementation must be maintained. We must not hand over to the Commission the running of the show; member states must continue to have proper oversight of the programme's implementation through programme committees, not in order to interfere unnecessarily in directing detailed research, but to ensure that the programme is effective, efficient and in keeping with the Council's intentions. We are pressing hard for that approach in the continuing negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am keen to see thematic coherence and simplification of programme management, so that procedures are less burdensome and bureaucratic. There has been progress on that, but more is needed. We want to press for time targets to be set for the key processes, such as reaching decisions on proposals and contract negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small and medium-sized enterprises need a clear, user-friendly administrative procedure. Within the Commission, there has been movement towards a single point of entry, which will allow small and medium-sized enterprises to reach into the whole programme in a way that is helpful to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that negotiations are still in full swing. It is not a case of our putting our objectives on the table and everyone immediately agreeing to them. There is a great debate at present, and there is a range of views within all member states as to how the programme should proceed. I am looking forward to hearing the Committee's views, which will help us to get it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.37 a.m. at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind members of the Committee that they can ask more than one question, but preferably not at the same time. In other words, members of the Committee are not limited to rising once to ask a question. Questions should be brief, and I hope that there will be plenty of time for all those who want to ask questions to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Minister with interest. Presumably, the summary of his speech was that the framework programmes have been very good; he is therefore congratulating the successive Conservative Governments who have previously implemented the framework programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must ask the Minister a key question. At one stage during his opening statement, he mentioned major expenditure, but he did not mention cost at all, and neither does the motion. The motion says that the Minister will send the proposals back to Europe
	<br><blockquote><p>"to improve focus, targeting and responsiveness to user needs."</p></blockquote>
That is not good enough. The Minister must address himself to the explanatory memorandum to document 7310/97, paragraph 14—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not like to interrupt the hon. Lady, but this is the question session, not the time for speeches. I would therefore be grateful if she would put a question to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is specifically about that paragraph. It states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The UK awaits the … detailed financial proposal from the Commission",</p></blockquote>
and that that was due immediately after the intergovernmental conference in July 1997. There appears to be a difference of opinion, because the Commission proposes a 24 per cent. increase in the cost of the programme, raising it to between £12 billion and £13 billion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) is about to say. I remind the hon. Lady again that this is the question session. Would she therefore put a question for the Minister to answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is: where does the Minister stand on the issue of cost? Does he intend to negotiate in a vacuum and ignore the cost to the United Kingdom, or can he tell us exactly what amount he wants allocated to the programme and how he will stop the Commission escalating its cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more than happy to do that. Concerning timing, the Commission did not make its proposal for the FP5 budget until July, which is why it was not available earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have consistently argued for the budget for the fifth framework to be at the same cash level as that for the fourth framework: about 13.2 billion ecu, or £9.2 billion. We have asked for the budget for the fifth framework to be fixed at the level of that for the fourth framework. That is because we sincerely believe that by sharpening the programme's focus and providing better management there is scope for getting better value from the same amount of money. We have asked for the same level of resources to be allocated to the next programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady is absolutely right: the Commission presented a proposal that would increase the budget by 23 per cent. It proposed that the budget for framework
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
five for 1999 to 2002 should be 16.3 billion ecu; that would represent a 23 per cent. increase on the budget for framework four.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have resisted that proposal and argued that the budget should be no greater than 13.2 billion ecu. We have stuck with that figure on the grounds that we can get better value for money by improving the targeting of the new programme themes and by improving the management of the programme. We do not accept the Commission's view as expressed in Agenda 2000 that the European Union's research budget should grow faster than its gross national project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know our way around the research and development scoreboard. We want increased investment in research and development, but the way to achieve that is not to apply across the public sector the target that we are trying to encourage the private sector to meet. We cannot hope that by massively increasing research in the public sector we will carry the private sector along; there must be a balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we consider the Commission's budget proposal to be wrong. We have challenged it and have consistently argued for the cash level of the fifth framework programme to be exactly the same as that of the fourth framework programme—13.2 billion ecu.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister guarantee to the British taxpayer that he will achieve his aim in keeping the budget to the level of the fourth framework? Will he accept that if he does not do so, he will have failed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not accept that. I think that the hon. Lady is rehashing another question in the background. Either we are in Europe or we are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says no. Some of his earlier questions suggested that he would rather be out altogether. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] We do not take that view. We are in a common programme, shaping up a common position, therefore we must negotiate. We are negotiating tough and hard and are getting far in our negotiations to hold the budget to where we want it to be. I have set out clearly our negotiating stance and we intend to stick as best we can to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have failed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady suggested that if the budget changes that will be a failure. That suggests that, deep down, the Conservative party is still interested in pulling out of Europe and having nothing to do with it. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Conservative Members do not accept the simple notion of wanting our money back and are not prepared to collaborate in joint funding programmes. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must all learn to negotiate. We are negotiating with our partners in Europe on a common structure and a budget that reflects value for money. That is our position and we intend to work to achieve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next question, may we have brief questions and, preferably, brief answers as well as far fewer sedentary interventions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish my hon. Friend well in his negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point that concerns me is that, in many ways, the fifth programme is not a reflection of, or follow-on from the fourth. We have thematic programmes, ranging from unlocking the resources of the living world and eco systems to the sixth one referring to improving human potential. Does my hon. Friend share my concern that in the document of the five-year assessment of the European Community research and development programmes, there seems to be glowing support for the fifth programme, yet no evaluation of the fourth programme? Will he address that fundamental issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I share his view. I got the impression at the Council of Ministers meeting on 16 May that the fourth programme sort of glides into the fifth. That is the whole point of trying to sharpen up the five programme areas. The Commission moved away from the fourth framework programme by proposing six—three themes and three supporting actions behind them. We went for five and consensus is building around that. I think the European Parliament will support that five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the negotiations, some member states seem to want the continuation of the fourth framework because it has been used as what I call substitution budgeting. It is simply putting in what they could not get from other resources nationally, or substitutions for other programmes, such as the European regional development fund or the European social fund. Some countries are keen to continue framework four because they see it as a good way of addressing their priorities. However, we say that they are not the priorities of scientific research and development and that there are other ways of addressing those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the fifth framwork to be a fresh start, to some extent, with clearly identified five themes. That will be difficult because if we do not agree the shape and budget of the fifth programme soon, there will be a hangover, with the fourth programme driving into it. That is why the negotiations and the timetable are absolutely crucial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Committee being asked to give the Minister a blank cheque? There will be no opportunity for further scrutiny before the key ministerial decisions are taken at the Council in February, notwithstanding the intervening discussions during the next few days? Is that not the case, and is it not characteristic of most of the Committee's endeavours?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister comment on the dichotomy between the attribution system required of the UK by Her Majesty's Treasury and the additionality system that the 14 other member states enjoy? Is not "enjoy" the right word, in so far as extra funding is demanded of the EU for those research programmes that it would not fund itself? Is that not a mechanism for ever-increasing expenditure on the part of the EU?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the second part of the hon. Gentleman's question, the Government are trying to sharpen up the content, focus and management of the programmes, including the advisory committees that will monitor them. I thought that I had emphasised—but perhaps not sufficiently—that member states do not hand over management of the programmes to the Commission, but retain a strong role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system of attribution, sometimes referred to as Europes, imposes a discipline on Departments, which negotiate spending programmes in Brussels, across a range of programmes—not only the science programme. If there were no checks and balances, Departments would have ambitious reasons to use any European funding that they could get their hands on, regardless of its relevance or value. We need to ensure that there are brackets around the system of attribution. The Government are committed to maintaining Departmental spending ceilings until March 1999. We are currently in the middle of a comprehensive spending review. We have accepted those brackets to give us the space to undertake the review, into which we shall blend a consideration of European expenditure and its impact on programmes—whether that opens them up or closes them down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the budget for a programme has been agreed, the system does not create any disincentive to bids for funds from it because attribution is made according to the UK's assessed contribution to the programme and not on receipts. The system is in place now; the Government are carrying out a comprehensive spending review and we will consider the impact of European spending and its implications for a range of budgets in Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, regarding finance, will my hon. Friend confirm whether any Minister in the previous Government gave a categorical commitment, before Council negotiations, that they would enter budgetary negotiations and return with 100 per cent. support for their position? I am sure that the answer is "no." Therefore, we have heard much political rhetoric this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Agenda 2000 document sets out the budgetary proposals from the Commission from 2000 to 2006, that will run alongside the framework proposals. Does the Minister agree that a 24 per cent. increase would be completely inconsistent with that tight spending constraint?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to reply that I would prefer to draw a line under what happened in the past and to move on to the future. We have hard work to do now, to negotiate the shape and the budget of the programme and to ensure that they are right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend that the implications of accepting a 24 per cent. increase are unacceptable. The Government are working hard, including in what are euphemistically referred to as bilateral negotiations—when I meet Ministers from Germany, France, Holland and Austria—and we are pressing for the agreement of a sensible budget because the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Commission's proposals are unacceptable. We want an approach that is more consistent with the fourth framework programme; we do not accept the Commission's view of the next round of financial perspectives, expressed in Agenda 2000. We would prefer to focus on the content and the management of the programme. We want to ensure that the structure and the controls are in place to sharpen up the programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure Opposition Members that there is plenty of scrutiny, not least through the Committee, to call the Government to account over negotiations, including budget negotiations. That scrutiny does not only take place at the beginning of programmes, but continues until they have been completed. The Government have to account both for their position at the outset of negotiations and how it works out in practice. I hope that there is sufficient parliamentary scrutiny, and I am confident that there will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very worried by the Minister's statement that he is going to stick to the fourth framework programme's budget. Will he tell us whether the extra funding requested under the fourth framework by Commissioner Edith Cresson is likely to be forthcoming? Is that extra funding still within the financial perspective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, that is an important question about the fourth framework. Most members of the Committee will know that there was pressure to top up the fourth framework's budget. Originally, the European Parliament wanted an additional 700 million ecu, which it then reduced to 200 million ecu. At the time, we agreed that some additional funding was required, but we would not shift from a figure of 100 million ecu. We strongly supported the view that the Council should maintain a common position during the conciliation procedure, as some member states wanted much more funding. We stuck to our original line, but we did not receive support from other member states—that is negotiation. The Conservative party was in a minority of one in Europe more often than we are ever likely to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After long and difficult negotiations, an agreement was reached on a total of 115 million ecu—not the 200 million ecu that the European Parliament had proposed, nor, indeed, 700 million ecu. We carefully and patiently negotiated the figure to a considerably lower level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conciliation committee's test has been approved by the European Parliament and will go forward to the Research Council next week. We intend to undertake that test in a positive manner when it comes before the Research Council. We showed our willingness to consider additional expenditure on landmine research in line with the European Parliament's figure of 20 million ecu, which was made possible by redistributing funds without exceeding the 100 million ecu ceiling. We worked within the figures we had set, and targeted expenditure. That is how to negotiate. All member states agreed to go above the common position of 100
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
million ecu, at which point we became isolated. However, that was only after we had negotiated an agreement with the other members on a significantly lower level than they had originally intended. We did a damned good job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a politician with a scientific background, I understand that this type of expenditure is an investment, from which we can expect a return. Opposition Members do not seem to recognise that. What thoughts does the Minister have about how we can build a cost benefit analysis into the process of focusing and targeting the research? Such analysis would inform our decisions about how the money was spent, and would reassure Opposition Members that the money was being well-spent and that we will get more back than we put in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. It cannot be stressed too often that we are concerned with investment, taking a long-term perspective, supporting research, and putting that research into practice in a way that will improve the quality of people's lives throughout Europe and increase the generation of wealth. Cost benefit analysis must be built in to improve management procedures. We must be engaged in managing the programmes through programme committees, which must have the necessary powers to have effective oversight of the programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is accepted that there will be fewer programmes than there were under the fourth framework. The committee should be able to set up working groups to assist in overseeing specific areas of the programme, and I hope that they will draw on the methodology of the cost benefit analysis. Even in the five programme structure—which includes the life sciences and the environment, the information society, production and transport, technologies and energy—the life sciences alone will cover an incredibly disparate field: biotechnology, medicine, agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Billions of ecu will be spent on those sectors, so member states and the Commission will need advice from users of the relevant technologies—public policy users as well as industrialists—so that a consensus can be found on the programme's benefits. The user advisory groups for each key area can advise on the research, technology and development that will be needed to meet objectives and can monitor implementation. We are thinking this through rather than simply giving funding to create a line in a budget for a particular programme. We will continue to manage and monitor it, always returning to primary questions such as the purpose of the programme and whether it achieves its intentions. My hon. Friend's point touches a primary issue: our purpose is to look to the longer term rather than to short-term, propped-up budget support decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee—except, of course, its Liberal Members who are not here—will be delighted to know that the Minister is engaged full swing in thematic blending leading to thematic coherence. May I disrupt the flow of questions by asking him to confirm that he is right by putting what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
he might describe as a primary question? How does the Minister see thematic coherence between study at the European level of live sciences and crude nutrition and health and the principle to which his Government are supposed to be attached—as the Conservative Government were attached—of subsidiarity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Explicit to our negotiations has been an expectation that we would focus on a limited number of objectives of clear European importance. We have not taken the generic, scattergun approach of the past. That is the idea behind pulling these matters together and that is why we welcome the action concept of targeting research in framework five on specific industrial and policy needs. In the life sciences, for example, multimedia content and tools would evidently fall within the information society, so there are clear brackets. However, within the life sciences, we can also pull together group topics, projects and bids. I say gently to the hon. Gentleman that the boundaries of scientific, engineering and technology research are changing. They do not adhere to traditional disciplines. Perhaps some people still think of the disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics, but themes now cut across traditional disciplines, meaning that we have to find new shapes to fit programmes to emerging science.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, subsets. We have expressed concern that wide areas of generic research proposed by the Commission within those programmes were without proper definition and objectives. We believe that some areas are more extensive than necessary, given the pressure for generic research, and we want tighter objectives. Our approach has focused on added value and subsidiarity, and we have, throughout the negotiations, tried to ensure that the programme will bring the highest returns when research is carried out at European level. Some things are better done through European collaboration and we should be targeting the programme at those areas as well as insisting that we, as a member state, should have a say in managing the programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that for all their concerns and whingeing about getting paperwork late, all we have heard from the Conservatives is Europhobic drivel? More importantly and arising from concerns expressed earlier, if we are to stick within the framework four budget levels and get the thematic blending that seems so much perversely to amuse Opposition Members, lessons must be learned from criticisms of the management, administration and evaluation of the fourth framework. Will my hon. Friend tell us whether negotiations on evaluation and management of framework five take account of lessons learned from framework four? If not, will lessons be learned from the strong criticism of the fourth framework on administration and evaluation as well as on the new thematic approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks whether lessons have been learned, and I am tempted to say that we are still working on them. They have not yet been sufficiently well learned, and they are part of the negotiations. The Commission's proposals for framework five envisage a much-reduced role for member states. At the Research Council meeting on 15 May—it was the first one that I attended—we expressed concern about the direction of the Commission's management proposals and the lack of detail. Recent discussions between member states and the Commission and the background conversations that are building up to the negotiations have started to open up the matter, so lessons are beginning to be learnt. We hope that the Research Council will be able to agree a satisfactory package on management issues. More emphasis must be placed on the matter because it is not satisfactory to let it run on as it has done in the past or to hand it over to the Commission. We can come up with a mechanism, which may be more complicated because of our involvement, but in Britain we have insight into the processes of managing programmes and we can contribute to the way in which they are managed in Europe. We intend to take that conversation forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made clear his intention to insist on sensible budget levels and states in the explanatory memorandum:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The UK considers that there is no case for an increase in the present level of the EU's funding."</p></blockquote>
The Minister also made clear his determination to ensure the retention of member state oversight of the programme in the face of the Commission's power grab. Will he confirm that at present the UK retains a veto in this area and that he is prepared to use it if necessary? Will he further confirm that, under the terms of the Amsterdam treaty, the UK will lose that veto and that if we were 18 months down the line the Minister would not have that remedy available to him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes, yes and yes, but we are involved in negotiations. We want the programme to work, but I have the impression from the hon. Gentleman's question that the wants to cling to the veto so that negotiations may be blocked by any means. We are not at that stage. We are entering positive negotiations because we positively want to make the programme work and get it up and running. We are setting out a fair stall of how that can be done. The hon. Gentleman seems to be saying that whatever we do and whatever we come up with, he wants us to block it anyway. That reflects the divisions in the Conservative party where some would rather not even be in Europe. That is the Opposition's problem, not mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have changed my question in response to the hon. Gentleman. Will my hon. Friend confirm that the negotiations will achieve far more if we seek to develop research at a European level instead of believing that science stops at the English channel? We need to co-operate and to work together to achieve a package which is focused, can be evaluated and is flexible. We can achieve more by working together.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Conservative Members seem to want British scientists to work on their own and to have nothing to do with anyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is stupid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that is stupid at all. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I had a meeting with about 60 scientists recently at which it was said that the age of laboratories in universities is over and that in future we must build on collaboration. Collaboration is the way forward in research. The cost of equipment for scientific research in a host of areas such as physics, biology, the human genome project, nuclear research into fusion and so on cannot be carried out at national level. Nations cannot afford the equipment unless resources are pooled. We must collaborate on some of the larger programmes and that is totally accepted. I would go further and say that it is beneficial for us to develop common themes and programmes in transport, not least when considering questions of environment and energy. Collaboration is a gain for us; it is not simply the result of being unable to afford to do what we want to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not understand that once the Government have thrown away the veto, he will have very little power to influence the negotiations in the way that he wants? Does he not understand that, with a veto, the EU must consider seriously a member state's view, accommodate that view and obtain the state's vote? Without a veto a member state can be isolated and ignored unless it goes along with the majority. Does the Minister not understand that, in this case, without a veto the EU could put through a 24 per cent. increase in the cost of the programme and all he could do would be to come back to Britain, apologise for the disaster and put up taxes to pay the bill? He has put up two taxes in the House in the past two weeks. Does he really want to get into the position where all he ever does is to increase taxes to pay somebody else's bill when he loses a vote?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not really know what is happening in the Conservative party, but for the shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to appear on the Back Benches in a Standing Committee and to ask me about the veto is rather surprising. It is not our intention to alter our proposals—we shall negotiate in relation to them. I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman is not seriously interested in negotiations or in reaching an agreement—he is putting his marker down to pull out. That is why he is here. However, he should sort out his war within the divided Conservative party elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It helps if we go to meetings and negotiate with others. We must learn about the process, develop our position, argue our case and take the chair at the table rather than leave an empty chair, which is why we were isolated previously. Our aim is to negotiate and to argue for Britain's interests, and to point out that we have the expertise to help to improve the programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Yes, we have made our mark in the budget—we pulled back from topping up the fourth framework programme, and we shall stick to lines that we have already established for the budget for the fifth framework programme.

I do not share the right hon. Gentleman's lack of self-confidence in these matters. We can go to such meetings, argue our case and—occasionally—win.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important for the research teams to reflect popular opinion and research opinion? A great majority of British people would welcome the announcement that a substantial share of the increased budget will go into land mine research. Is he worried that the Conservative party's opposition to the increase reflects a continuation of its unpopular opposition to a worldwide land mine ban?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That matter was part of the negotiations on the top up of the fourth framework programme. We decided against simply having a pot of money, about the use of which we should be very focused. There was some flexibility in that programme, which will allow us to respond to what is evidently a current need around which we can reach a consensus—that would be universally welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much progress has been made with regard to defining the scientific and technological content of the programmes. In response to a request from the Council in May, CREST—the committee of the senior officials from the member states—examined the Commission's proposals in detail. Broad consensus was reached about amending them, although in one or two areas we still have to agree on even the broad programmes, including, for example, engineering technologies for a clean, safer and more efficient vehicle. We should give that matter the appropriate weight. So far, we have managed to secure key actions and define the relevant subjects in a satisfactory way, which had not always been achieved previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New developments are emerging that could be of importance to our agenda, including global change and multidisciplinary research into aging in the new century. Those areas of research emerged during current discussion and research, and we should not keep them off the agenda simply because we have set a five-year programme. We must have some flexibility and allow such subjects to emerge. We have made progress in defining and targeting generic research more clearly, but we must keep pressing with regard to other programmes. Occasionally, we can collaborate and agree on an agenda even in thematic terms. Aging was one such subject and global change and energy and the environment were others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) mentioned land mines. They were discussed during the top-up debate on the fourth framework programme. That matter is topical in Britain and throughout Europe and the rest of the world. We could take practical steps in those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was amazed to hear some of the comments of Opposition Members. The previous Government's negotiating skills consisted of saying,

"We shall take our ball home if we don't get our own way." Do not we have a clear commitment to fight Britain's case, and to do so harder and more successfully than ever the Conservatives did? Difficult and complex negotiations are involved, and the previous Government's attitude meant that no one took them seriously. The difference today is that we are taken seriously in Europe, and there is a much better chance of our getting a better deal for Britain than ever the Tories did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I was surprised about some developments in the Council of Ministers. Our intention is to get to know Ministers in other member states, and to talk to them both inside and outside meetings. It surprised me that, in the past, we did not see Britain's representatives because the contact did not exist in the way it does now. We can use the background negotiations to sharpen up agendas because that is how politics work. We can lobby and say, "If you will not go along with us in keeping the programme to this content or budget level, we will all be lost, so will you start to negotiate in detail?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is absolutely right; the previous Government effectively took their bat home and left empty chairs, so there was no one to negotiate with. That is why we did so badly and were not respected. We are now welcomed because we turn up and have something positive to contribute to drive agendas forward, and we look forward to furthering this work when we take over the presidency after Christmas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can we have any confidence in the Minister's magical and persuasive powers of negotiation? He appears to the Committee to be quite at ease with the idea of Britain relinquishing the veto in this key area of policy. As the United Kingdom is the second largest net contributor to the European budget, will not our fellow members—many of which are smaller countries—with their system of additionality, regard the UK as a soft touch? Will there be no opportunity for us to negate their excessive demands unless we persuade them—as I hope the Minister will do in negotiation—to move from the system of additionality that is so convenient to them to the system of attribution in force in this country, which rightly gives the Treasury some control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are fighting a rearguard action all the time. The veto does not remove the need to negotiate. We should bear in mind that all the other member states also have a veto but that we have to negotiate whether or not we have a veto. We are at the primary negotiations stage. I get the impression that some Conservative Members—perhaps not all but I cannot work out where the faction lines now lie—would rather that we did not negotiate at all but that is their difficulty, not the Government's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that the greatest extension to qualified majority voting took place in 1986 under the previous Government who bulldozed the Single European Act through the House of Commons in spite of our opposition? Would my
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
hon. Friend also comment on the distinction between qualified majority voting, which I support, and extending the delegated powers of the Commission? Does he share my concern that, during the negotiations, we should pay particular attention to the crucial balance between member states' control and extending the competence of the Commission under delegated powers? The problem is that the Commission tends to consider that everything European has added value without applying the scrutiny necessary to determine that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer, briefly, is yes. That is why we resisted not only the content of the Commission's proposal but considered that the management proposals took too much away from the member states, both in general terms of the balance between the Commission and member states and particularly regarding this programme, the management of which would be more effective if the users had a much greater say. I take on board my hon. Friend's comments and thank him for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to the question of the budget. He caricatured the position expressed by Conservative Members. Presumably, he considers himself to be a member of a fiscally prudent Government. His explanatory memorandum says that the UK considers that there is no need for any increase in the present level of EU funding and indeed believes that it may be possible to reduce costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He speaks of negotiation. Being fiscally prudent, and having established categorically that the United Kingdom believes that there is no case for expansion of the budget, what room for negotiation does the Minister feel he has? Must not he stand firm? Does not any concession or negotiation on that represent a relaxation of fiscal discipline?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) began by saying that she did not know our position on the budget because it was not clear. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has confirmed that it is written down—we could not have made it clearer. We have stated our position and we are sticking to it. We have consistently argued for the budget of the fifth framework programme to be the same amount as that of the fourth framework programme—13.2 billion ecu. We are pressing for that and negotiations are not yet over. We have pressed other member states in bilateral negotiations and behind the scenes to accept the common sense of that, and I think that we are winning through. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. The hon. Lady cannot tell us that we have not staked out a position and then, when her hon. Friend points out that we have, say that they do not agree with it. We have made our position clear. We are sticking to that in negotiations and are fighting hard for it. I fear to know what more we could do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members continually hark on the subject of the budget as if it could be taken out of the context of the overall European Union budget. It is not true that an increase in this budget
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
would create pressure to increase the total EU budget in future years, and that if that pressure were resisted and the EU budget did not rise, funds from other European budgets would be veered into this budget? Is it not also true that it would be greatly in our interest for a large amount of money, which currently goes to subsidise inefficient farms on the continent, to be veered towards British science and research? That might be a way around the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for widening the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I hope that the Minister will not respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am eager to do so. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is the shape of our debate and the direction in which the Opposition are driving us. I accept that we should consider the issue in the round. In considering the fourth programme, about which members of the Committee have expressed a view, I am convinced that the programme could be sharpened up to deliver greater value for money. By doing that, and with better and more rigorous management, we can stick at the level of the fourth programme. That is our negotiating position and where we have staked our ground. I am sticking with the figure. I want to see more investment in research and development and in science, engineering and technology as a whole, but in sorting out this negotiation, structure and budget, I have outlined our ground. I am reasonably confident that we can get a good result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could descend to detail and draw the Minister's attention to the third part of section 4.1.2 of document 7594/97. What effect will this magnificent European research budget effort have on the single most notable case of the utilisation of standards on a common basis, namely, Global System Mobile?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole programme in the European fourth framework involved a range of companies, institutions and universities. The general impression was that the programme provided value for money. It enhanced and increased research effort, added value to research in Britain and enabled the transfer of technology from that work to business and industry. As for bovine spongiform encephalopathy and how it was handled—I may be ruled out of order for raising this matter—Global System Mobile came almost entirely from research in framework programmes three and four. It does not have a place in framework five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend be prepared to give open-minded consideration to the recommendation of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology, which includes Conservative Members, that the policy of attribution, which is unpopular among the British research community, be reviewed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
At present, if I am researching 15th century fish, and you, Mr. Maxton, are researching safe ecological technology, and if Europe collectively decides to give you a pound more and me a pound less, the risk is that Whitehall will smile sepulchrally and take a pound from your United Kingdom budget and give it back to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a slight exaggeration, because funds are accumulated at departmental level, rather than at project level, but the basic principle is extremely disliked. The more successful people are at promoting a project at the European level, the more they are punished at the British level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Attributions are made at the level of departmental budgets, not at the level of individual university research budgets. That ought to be made plain, because sometimes an elision is made to suggest otherwise. It is up to universities and research institutes to decide their own priorities. I am tempted to suggest that if they want to participate, it is up to them to match their priorities and contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Europes system is the process of attribution through departmental budgets, and each Department has its own Europes baseline. At present, we are reviewing all of the departmental budgets, including those baselines, within the comprehensive spending review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is widely believed in the research community that amounts attributed have a direct negative effect on Departments' research and development budgets and the organisations that they fund. That is not necessarily the case; it appears so in generic terms, but it does not have to be the case. That ought to be said; there is a real debate on the matter, but, to be frank to my hon. Friend, that debate proceeds within the comprehensive spending review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That brings us to the end of the time allotted to questions, and I call the Minister to move the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 7310/97, on the European Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, and 10385/97, on the amended proposal for the Fifth Framework Programme; and supports the Government's view that the Commission's proposals would benefit from amendment in key areas to improve focus, targeting and responsiveness to user needs.—[	<i>Mr. Battle.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the courtesy of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) in allowing other hon. Members to speak first. I will not detain the Committee for long, but I want to make some fundamental points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, can the Minister state unequivocally whether we will have a further opportunity to scrutinise the fifth framework programme before the key Council of Ministers' decision is taken to implement it? If not, we are being asked to write a blank cheque. We all know that that is the normal procedure in this Committee.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
We regularly and typically write blank cheques. That is the essence of the take-note procedure. Were we not to pass the take-note motion in the name of the Minister, that would have no material consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we go through this charade, and it is important that our electorate should realise that the proceedings of this Committee are in practical terms a charade, although they give Parliament and the wider public a valuable insight into the workings of the institutions of the European Union—in this case, in the area of research and technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always been interested in that area. I started my career in the House as a member of the Select Committee on Science and Technology, and I have chaired the areospace science and technology committee of the Western European Union in Paris and the space committee of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, so I am not unfamiliar with international collaboration in science and technology; I care deeply about it, as do all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me—and other hon. Members—is whether the public are getting good value for money. Competitor countries, such as Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and Japan are quite capable of focusing their science and technological effort and their research programmes in a way that leads to the modernisation of their industry and its increasing competitiveness in world markets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To assume that we must participate in an ever more costly, bureaucratic European programme right across the board with wide thematic and other ambitions is highly questionable. We must examine the exercise against the backdrop of the financial perspective that was set at the Edinburgh summit in the previous Parliament. Some of us, it will be recalled, were not prepared to accept that financial perspective and, with the benefit of hindsight, hon. Members now understand why. Our country is paying more and more into the European Union year on year, when the money could be much better used in areas of interest to our electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I tried to get the Minister to admit, the fifth framework programme is a system of bidding. He would call it negotiation but, in essence, it is a process of horse trading, whereby each member nation hopes to get European funding for the pet research programmes that are of greatest interest to themselves. That is what it is all about, and we are involved in it too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one of the largest donors, I should have thought that we had a particular entitlement to benefit disproportionately, but that is not what our Community partners have in mind. After Amsterdam, when we moved to majority voting and relinquished the veto, they can gang up against us to ensure that the programmes that are of particular interest to themselves are bankrolled by the British.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
That is why I ask the Minister to descend to the real world, to abjure the slogans with which he usually addresses the Committee and to realise that there are fundamental problems. I sought to remind him of one of them, which is that all the other countries have a process of additionality, whereby their research budgets receive a windfall from the European Union to pursue pet programmes that they do not fund themselves, whereas we in our much more Treasury-driven way, are required to make commensurate reductions to offset the extra money that we receive from the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be infinitely more confident that the negotiation—or the process of capitulation, which I am sure it will be—would not end up as an increase of about a quarter, which the Commission expects for the fifth framework programme, if I thought that the Minister, with all his powers of persuasion, which I am sure before long will become legendary, would get the continentals to change their ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Continentals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, they are continentals and we happen to be an island nation. Those are facts of history and geography which we cannot change, so we might as well acknowledge them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should have addressed the question of Euratom's budget with stringency and careful scrutiny. The theme behind much of the research programme is one of establishing technologies in areas that will be environmentally friendly. The Labour party has not traditionally been enamoured of nuclear power and many Labour party members have been deeply worried by excessive reliance on it. I recognise that it is important for the Committee to know whether the Euratom budget will be well spent and whether it will grow year by year at a time when the United Kingdom is moving away from nuclear power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the interest in infusion programmes, such as the Counseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire and so on. This country takes the lead in such programmes throughout the continent of Europe—if I am allowed to use that phrase. It would greatly benefit the Committee to know how the Euratom budget will develop over the five years of the fifth framework programme. There is no quantification of that budget nor is there any identification of the specific programmes for nuclear research that will be funded. Again, that is an example of a blank cheque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to my original theme, I hope that in future meetings of the Committee the Minister will move away from broad-brush sloganising and address the hard political realities of seeking endorsement not only from the Committee, but from the public, for the additional spending on grandiose European programmes that are inherent in the fifth framework programme, as they are in so much else that is proposed by the European Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his first-class performance this morning. He is clearly in charge of his brief and we have great confidence in what he said. I also support the Government's position on the budget, details of which are clearly laid out at the back of the documents, although I do not know whether Opposition Members have read that far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems with the European Union budget have been expressed before in the Committee, and they arise from the nonsense of the common agricultural policy, not from research and development. Indeed, this country is a net contributor to the budget as a result of the advanced common agricultural policy structure, where richer countries are net beneficiaries. Clearly, that is an anomaly. When we can secure the reform of the common agricultural policy to which the Government are committed, we may be able to change that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to the reform of the common agricultural policy. Can he put a time scale on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, I am not important enough to answer that question. The hon. Lady must address her question to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I want the hon. Gentleman to put a time on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not debating the common agricultural policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For many years, I have felt that the policy is nonsense. I have written volumes on the common agricultural policy and want it to be changed and reduced at the earliest possible stage. This Government are the first Government to commit themselves seriously to reforming it rather than simply ranting about the net problems of the budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again. He has just said that he is an expert on the common agricultural policy, so I ask him again to put his own timetable on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have ruled that we are not debating the common agricultural policy and I do not wish to hear any more about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to move on the subject of research and development, which is what our debate is about. My previous remarks were by way of an introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Spending on research and development in the European Union and in Britain has fallen, whereas in Japan and the United States of America it has increased. We should worry about that. I strongly support our resistance to increasing the EU budget, but it is important that member state Governments and the private sector raise their research and development spending so that in the 21st century we can challenge the stong economies in other parts of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
world. We must not allow ourselves to fall behind in research and development, as it is the seed corn of future economic success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have particular concern about research on nuclear fusion, which is extremely valuable in the longer term. Even this week, Brtish scientists made a significant advance; we are getting closer to producing energy from fusion. However that still needs a 50-year time scale, which is a long time; it will be expensive and requires an international effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the shorter term—perhaps in the next two decades—we will have to adjust our energy production and expand non-nuclear methods, especially those involving renewable energy sources. This country is blessed with access to renewable sources that other countries may not possess but, even with that advantage, there is not sufficient drive behind research into renewables either in this country or in the EU. The EU is dominated by France, with its commitment to nuclear energy. Even in this country, the availability of cheap gas means that the drive behind research into renewables is not what it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1996, the research budget for nuclear fusion was three times that for all non-nuclear energy. When one adds the research budget for nuclear safety—we must not cut corners in nuclear safety—the money available for non-nuclear research is a tiny speck in the whole budget. In the longer term, this country and the EU must spend more on research in such areas, not just for our sake but for the sake of the world. Britain and Europe have taken a lead in terms of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which are a serious problem. Sadly, the United States has not followed our lead, but we must press that agenda much harder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, we are blessed with sources of renewables around our shores that we could exploit. We must put more energy—to use a pun—into research into renewables.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have finished, but I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the hon. Gentleman has finished, he cannot give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we would all agree that the terminology in the papers is somewhat confusing, and the European Commission itself seems to be confused. There is an interesting table on page 17 of document A, showing the percentage breakdown of the financial envelope of the framework programmes. In the Commission's terminology, "action" means "activity". If one compares the percentages for the fifth framework, which are shown in the table, with the percentages for the revised fourth framework—they are included in one of the two papers we received recently, and show the total ecus—one finds that there has been an enormous increase in the fourth activity, which deals with training and mobility of researchers, from 6.6 per cent. to 10 per cent. As far as I can see, the Commission has not mentioned that in its notes. The Government mention
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
it in their response. In paragraph 17 on page 6 of document R, they rightly welcome the increase. The primary objective of European support should be to facilitate research throughout the Community rather than to focus on specific projects. For example, those researching clean energy will, of course, be interested in any major European project on it. They will hope to be part of the project, and they will be interested in other people's results. However, there will be other projects apart from that single one, many of which will be international and outside the European Union. The crucial benefit that the European Union can provide to Britain and the other member states is to facilitate access to the latest research findings by promoting travel, exchange, the new Internet 2 and other communication facilities across the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To use the Commission's terminology, the Government should be promoting the horizontal programmes—the second, third and fourth activities—and exercising restraint on the first activity, which now receives 86 per cent. of spending, the lion's share. The increase in the fourth activity has been funded by a slight reduction in the first and third activities and a substantial reduction—from 5 to 3.5 per cent. of the budget—in the second activity, which is international co-operation. That substantial reduction has happened partly because the European Union is phasing out direct support for central and eastern European centres, so they no longer appear as a burden on the budget. However, the European Union is also phasing out some support for development programmes which run in partnership with third-world countries, which send developers to us, from which we and they benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third paragraph—which begins with the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"participation in programmes open to third countries without specific co-operation agreements"—</p></blockquote>
on page 37 of document A, lists the aims of the second programme and a number of countries eligible for it, but, unlike most of the other paragraphs, excludes developing countries. I urge the Minister to try to avoid an erosion of such partnerships. It is in the interests of everyone in the European Union—and, indeed, the world—to build up such partnerships with developing countries. However, I agree with the Government's support for the increase in the fourth activity—training and mobility of researchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The empowerment in information and exchange of individual researchers is slightly understated in the programme. There are two areas where the European Union could naturally provide much help. The first is information on natural language translation, which has reached a fairly advanced stage so that it is possible to provide rough translations of documents of broad interest. Secondly, there is the promotion of projects on the Internet to help researchers within the European Union find the vital information that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) mentioned two elements that were new to me. He called for public endorsement of increased spending. I was unsure whether he was calling for a
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
referendum on spending increase or whether he was referring to the Conservative policy on a referendum on the Amsterdam treaty. I am not sure whether the latter is still Conservative policy. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will clarify what he meant by "public endorsement". Was he calling for another general election?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was expressing the hope that the public would understand the issues involved and endorse any decision—at least, notionally in their own minds. They should be confident that any additional spending is in their best interests and those of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. He also endorsed the policy of Government-led research prioritising that is used in Japan, South Korea and other countries. That is a novelty for the Conservative party, which has hitherto argued that it is difficult for Governments to set priorities in research. Was that a deliberate change of policy, or merely rhetoric?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government feel that it is appropriate to focus on key policies with which individual companies cannot grapple, such as transport, ecology and European infrastructure. There is no interest or incentive for an individual company to undertake massive research into such policies. In addition to the empowerment and mobilisation of individual researchers, that is the second area that we should view as the priority for European research. I would be critical of projects that could be done just as well at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the Government's emphasis on subsidiarity, and welcome their support for researchers. I urge the Government to urge their European partners to focus on those projects that can be carried out only at a European level, and to give them the broad support that they need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been disappointed by the partisan tone into which the debate has degenerated. Having read the document and the explanatory memorandums, I expected the Minister to give the Committee a far more robust defence of his intention to stand up to the European Union in what seems to me to be a blatant power grab by the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather pleased with the tone of the explanatory memorandums: I started to get a sense of the distinction between the Commission's view of the world and what I would describe as the typically British view of the world, which is to some extent cross-party. It is clear and uncontroversial that the appraisal of the outcome of the fourth framework is considered to be shoddy, unscientific and unrigorous. Nevertheless, the Commission draws from that study the conclusion that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"only solution is to give the Commission the means fully to exercise the powers of programme implementation."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
The documentation acknowledges that there have been inadequate management and accountancy procedures. The Commission's response to that is to propose a 24 per cent. increase in budget, and a dramatic reduction in the level of member state scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would fully support the Minister if he would tell us robustly that he will not tolerate such nonsense, and that he will exercise his veto if necessary to ensure that what I have just characterised as the British view of the world—it may be shared by others, but that is how I will characterise it—will prevail over the empire-building Commission view of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman any evidence that Britain will be alone in the negotiations? It is at least possible that other member states feel exactly the same and support us, and that we might win the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has preempted some questions that I wanted the Minister to touch on. Can he tell us the state of play among the member states, whether he sees any support emerging for the British position or whether we are in a minority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also address a subject not yet adequately dealt with today? The documents refer to the importance of consultation, particularly among end users of research and small and medium-sized enterprises. However, the papers are distinctly vague on how consultation is to be achieved. Will the Minister tell us how he will ensure that in the United Kingdom—and preferably across the Union—small and medium-sized enterprises and users of research are properly brought into that process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the track record of demonstration projects funded under the fourth framework? Demonstration projects are all very well in theory but may come dangerously close to picking winners, and we have all seen that that is a discredited Government activity with no great success rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister had come to us with a robust position on all those points, telling us that he would defend Britain's interests with the veto if need be, we would have been able to support him. He would then have had to explain why the Government surrendered veto power in this area in the Amsterdam treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not recall this as he was not here, but, in the late 1980s, the UK used the veto to block the budget for the third framework programme. That did not help as we were obliged eventually to settle for a budget pretty close to the starting figure. Use of the veto does not necessarily gain what we want, as previous Conservative Governments discovered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it that the Minister believes that not having the power of veto enhances his negotiating position? There is nothing to say that because one has a power of veto one cannot negotiate.
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
Of course one can, but with a veto one has an additional power available for additional leverage in the negotiation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that to allow every country in an increasingly large community a veto over every decision would be a formula for increasing stalemate? For instance, if a veto existed in the area of BSE, we would never be able to lift the ban because one country or another would always block it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue is the exercise of the veto in the area that we are discussing. As I have said, nothing says that the veto has to be used. It is simply a weapon in the negotiating armoury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend can confirm that in an article in today's papers a Labour Minister announces that he is increasingly frustrated with BSE negotiations in Europe. Indeed, the Minister is failing to secure any of the things that the Labour party believed so easy to secure when we were in government and had a veto. Those issues are still proving difficult despite our having given away more vetos than any other country at the last—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. First, interventions should be brief. Secondly, we are not debating BSE. Please return to the main topic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention and information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister discuss the empire-building tone that I have detected in the documents, which sets my teeth on edge? I do not see that as a party political issue. The Commission sees the world in a distinctive way: budgets must increase at least in line with gross national product, and then some more. The Minister states in his explanatory memorandum that the UK sees no case for that view of the world. The Commission feels that management of the programmes would be best overseen by itself without the irritation of member-state oversight. Again, the Minister has told us that he does not share that view. Is not the distinctively British view of the world a little at odds with the view taken by the Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's comments about the empire-building tone of the documents that some members of the Committee apparently did not have time to read. I have found this debate extraordinarily depressing, in that both today and last week I have heard Opposition Members describe our European partners as foreigners, as aliens and, today, as continentals. That attitude is light years away from the enlightened approach that we need to get the best for Britain in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a crucial subject that is of key importance to higher education, industry and the health of our science and manufacturing base. The funds involved are 3 per cent. of the European Union budget and 10 per cent. of the United Kingdom's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
publicly funded research provision, and we should focus on them in some detail. The collaborative research that the previous framework programmes supported and which has been suggested for framework five is enormously important to Britain—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman: this is an extremely important—and very detailed—subject. Does he agree that the time given to scrutinise the documents is inadequate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with the hon. Lady that we need to review the overall scrutiny procedures that we inherited from the previous Government. Speaking as a member of the Select Committee on European Legislation, I believe that if we were to open up and improve European decision-making processes, we should improve significantly on the procedures that we inherited. The Government are considering that matter as part of their modernisation of the House of Commons. I—and, I am sure, the Government—will welcome her support when the matter arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reasons for us to welcome the collaborative research programme. As was said earlier, it supports researchers' training and mobility. From my contact with firms in my constituency and with higher education institutions, the programme is widely welcomed. The framework programmes have also helped to create a climate in which collaboration between a higher education institution and a company has resulted in further collaboration outside the framework programme. The Government are committed to improving links between higher education and industry, and the development is therefore to be welcomed. Valuable research is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should underline the fact that Britain has done extraordinarily well out of the previous framework programmes. Comment was made earlier on the common agricultural policy, but we are a net beneficiary of the framework funds. That fact should be acknowledged by people who constantly make a point of criticising Europe and anything to do with the European Union. In broad terms, I welcome framework five's proposals but I am at the same time constructively critical, and I shall try to highlight those matters on which the Government should focus more attention in the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programmes need to be better focused. If they are diversified, as the Commission proposes, there is a real danger that credibility and awareness will be lost among the relevant companies and higher education institutions. Despite the improvements that have been made, there is a significant need for better management control and for better reviews of the framework programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The composition of some of the management committees that currently oversee the programmes needs to be examined. They are sometimes unwieldy and occasionally they impede decision-making. Committee meetings can often involve 60 people, excluding the translators, and that is not the best mechanism to oversee those programmes'
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
management. We also need to streamline decision-making within the Commission, and, as the Minister suggested, there should be greater opportunities for the involvement of users in the management of those programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a continuing need to improve the review and validation of research. That was done under framework four but it must be developed further in framework five. As a result of discussions with major pharmaceutical research companies in my constituency, I think that the Commission's management of the programmes should be more user-friendly. Members of such companies have commented that the legal and financial departments at the Commission are sometimes unapproachable and are unwilling or unable to give advice and information. That matter needs consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider attribution. Like some of my colleagues, I welcome the call by the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology for the Government to modify attribution that is applied to research expenditure. That would give UK negotiators an interest in succeeding in the acquisition of framework funding, as opposed to failing. It is especially relevant as we are a net beneficiary at present. I am not convinced that the other 14 countries are wrong in the way that they deal with the framework funds, and that we are right. We should not make trivial applications, but the Government should consider the position when we have moved beyond the constraints of the spending limits that will exist until March 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister examine how we use and implement the funds in Britain? I welcome the acceptance by Customs and Excise that funding to UK universities from the Commission, under the framework programmes, is exempt from VAT. I understand from my discussions with universities that there are still problems, however. Each case is dealt with separately, and that practice should be reformed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to highlight one further financial matter—the impact on the programmes of the rise in the value of sterling over the past year. It means that a typical contract that has been awarded is worth 10 per cent. less than at this time last year. The Government's recent, positive statement on British entry to EMU would provide a solution to that problem—although some Opposition Members might not agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to express my disappointment with the Opposition's approach to the Committee's discussions this morning. The framework programmes are a UK success story and they show Britain getting the best result from Europe. The Opposition's view on negotiations is simplistic and naive. Any employee in the real world of business, who expected to enter negotiations and win on 100 per cent. of the issues that he or she had put forward, would be sent for career counselling. We are discussing a serious matter that involves getting the best for Britain, and the Government's plans are the most likely to achieve that, in stark contrast to what we have seen previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.17 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had some thoughtful speeches in the debate, perhaps more so than the responses we received from the Minister during questions. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood made an especially thoughtful speech. He drew attention to the real problems—unfortunately, we were unable to do that effectively because of Committee procedure—that face any serious member of the Committee of whatever party, when they consider large and complex documents in a very short time scale. That is inevitable because of Brussels bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sat on the Committee on several previous occasions, during one of which we discussed a pile of paper that was two or three times the size of the one before us today. That was the European budget, about which I had prolonged correspondence with the Economic Secretary in which she eventually admitted that she, too, had not understood what it contained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience of the Committee process makes it clear that the reform to which some hon. Members have referred is long overdue. That reform must be carried out urgently if the House of Commons is to have any effective role in vetting such documents. That applies to all hon. Members of whatever party. We all have an interest in the pursuit of democracy and in properly informed debate. That means that we must receive papers early; we must have opportunities for briefings from knowledgable officials either from Brussels or from Whitehall. That would enable us to put rational questions, which would be answered by well-informed Ministers. I suspect that the Minister has faced as much difficulty in getting to grips with the material as other hon. Members, a point to which I shall return later. In the absence of such reform, no one can be satisfied that the House is genuinely engaged in what it is apparently engaged in during the sittings of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with many of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. At our last meeting, I made the point that we received huge and bulky documentation, which was usually mostly tosh. It is difficult to wade through. That is not the Government's fault, but it is a matter that they must consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if, instead of wasting the Committee's time with points of order, that argument was put to Ministers as constructively as he has put it to the Committee, the Government might be more willing to agree to provide us with the information that he wants in the form that he wants it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the charade is intensified by the need to begin a further charade. Unfortunately, no other means were provided for making that assertion at the beginning of our debate. If the system were reformed, the need for those remarks and for the more constructive spirit that some of us are demonstrating this morning, would evaporate and we could spend time discussing the issue rather than discussing how to discuss it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) made a thoughtful contribution in which he drew attention to one of the main points on which I want to focus. Going through the large pile of documents at high speed as best as I was able, which was not very well, it became apparent, as the many members of the Committee who have read them would agree, that little distinction has been made between those areas where the principles of subsidiarity would genuinely allow a European focus and those where they would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood—we both represent the extreme Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative party—I accept—as most hon. Members on both sides of the Committee probably do—that genuine benefits can be gained by co-operation on a European or wider scale. Considerable areas of scientific research, such as CERN—the European centre for nuclear research—could not be afforded by individual member states and co-operation in such projects is desirable. However, the documents draw little distinction between projects where such co-operation has genuine added value—a ghastly term—and those where it does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the purpose of my questions to the Minister was to evoke answers which would show whether he, and therefore his officials, in discussing and considering the issues before coming to Committee, had discovered whether the vast array of terminology and prose was directed towards the admirable goal of separating those elements of research that could best be conducted at the European level from those that could best be conducted nationally or privately. I regret to say that my clear impression from the Minister's responses was that there had been no such investigation. He focused—admirably enough—on the budget and its constraints. Many Opposition Members believe, as will become evident, that his negotiating position is not as strong as we would wish it to be. Nevertheless, we commend and applaud him for focusing on it. However, he did not focus on separating projects that would best be performed at one level from those that would best be performed at another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I drew attention to food, nutrition and health, and the hon. Member for Broxtowe drew attention to the first action. The general heading in the first action under which, thematically, food, nutrition and health would fall is the first—"living world and the ecosystem". I admit that I am not a scientist and that when I read such documents I feel more revulsion than I should, and that may cloud my intellectual abilities, but I could not determine whether there was a single sub-heading under "living world and the ecosystem", where it was argued that there were benefits to conducting the research at a European rather than a domestic level. The Medical Research Council laboratory in Cambridge has, I believe, more Nobel prizewinners in microbiology than the whole of the European Community outside the UK. That research body—funded on a fraction of the amount allowed for 28 per cent. of the expenditure under action 1—shows that highly productive research can take place at the national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
I know no reason for believing that conducting research at a European level will produce any gains, except, of course, for what my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) described as the Commission's "power grab"—the more activities that are transferred to the European level, the more money the Commission controls. The Commission can then exploit that control in its intricate negotiations with member states, aggrandising itself in areas other than research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of scientific research, however, I am wholly unpersuaded that large sections of the budget can be justified in the context of subsidiarity. When I put that to the Minister, he resorted to reading out a large amount of what I would impolitely describe as official waffle. I understand his problem—I was once a special adviser to a Secretary of State—but the Minister had no answer to the question of whether the programme for nutrition and health could be justified in terms of subsidiarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then attempted to pose a further question, to elucidate an area that I think could derive an enormous benefit from European co-operation. The Minister himself pursued the question of whether the programme that he was going to negotiate in Brussels—I agree with the pessimistic analysis of my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood that he would ultimately capitulate—genuinely assisted those areas of technology that would gain from European co-operation. Third generation mobile telephony, which converges with video conferencing and data transfer, would especially benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sole success—apart from CERN—of the fourth research framework that the wider public can understand is global systems for mobile communications—GSM. By contributing to the development of GSM telephony, the European Union has undoubtedly assisted European operators to develop a framework. That was mainly achieved with private sector money, but there was also an injection of money from the European Union. The European framework has proved to be the most successful for global mobile operations, and has now spread to Asia, south America, Africa, and many other parts of the world, to the great advantage of Europeans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can find no indication in any of the papers that the EU's support will be continued for the third generation mobile telephony. When the Minister was asked that question, my impression was that he would be able to find an offical who could give him an answer in due course, but that he had not investigated the matter in advance. That suggests to me—I can well understand it on a personal level—that the Minister had not had the time to find out whether the papers addressed that kind of question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and for the tone in which he has made his helpful contribution to the debate, especially in the distinctions that he has drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hesitated in responding to the hon. Gentleman earlier because there is another EU Council that deals with information technology, which is looking
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
precisely at the question of the third generation of GSM. I do not serve on that council—the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) does. I think that there is a separate research budget supporting that council, other than that of the Office of Science and Technology. I was not sure whether the third generation of GSM was not included in the key actions because it was being dealt with by that council. That was the only confusion, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that. I am sure that we can genuinely agree that co-operation at the European level is the best way to get the international information networks right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that clarification. It is reassuring that he has attended to that issue, even if not in the context of the pile of papers in front of the Committee today. Throughout the documentation, relatively little attention is drawn to that distinction. In a forceful speech, the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) drew attention to that problem. There is a desperate need to reform the Committee's proceedings to make them more effective and to adopt a different approach to European Union documents. We should attempt not merely to negotiate about budgets at a late stage in the game, having accepted the general purport of the documentation for want of any other method of proceeding. Rather, at a much earlier stage, we should attempt to capture our own representation in Brussels—which, I fear, we very often fail to do—to ensure that, within our own ministries, the crucial distinctions between those things best done locally and those things best done at a European level are made and understood. Then, hopefully, instead of piles of papers appearing with hardly any thought being given to what we, in Britain, regard as the main issue, they will be presented in a way that at least enables us to see that the arguments have been considered. If the process is correct we shall be able to ask sensible questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to hear the Minister's statement. It is important that we should have a clear focus and clear criteria by which to assess research and development. As we have seen in the budget submission, it is easy for people involved in research and development to demand more money. I am pleased that the Government have said that enough is enough and that we must work within the fourth framework budget. It is also important to have a European-wide strategy and to work together as Europeans to achieve the best possible research and development programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to highlight one particular problem alluded to by the Opposition. Looking though the documentation, it is difficult to understand how research and development will be assessed. Page 3 of the document outlines the need for research to reflect the ethical concerns of the public. That will become an increasingly important issue for research and development because people are anxious that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
researchers and scientists should not operate in a vacuum but should be responsible to the public for the research and development carried out. I would like the Minister to confirm that that will be at the forefront of his mind when it comes to considering assessment criteria. We have talked about the Euratom project, research and development in the nuclear field, and in relation to animals and the environment. Those are important areas that need continually to be assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that, once established, the fifth framework should not be set in tablets of stone. There must be flexibility to change the programme as it develops. There is nothing worse than a programme that gathers its own momentum and drives itself along because of what was originally agreed. We all agree that value for money is important but to achieve value for money flexibility and clear assessment of projects is vital. Without that, all sorts of research will take place that may satisfy one or two research establishments but does nothing to meet the set objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's statement is welcome. Hopefully, in the fifth framework we shall have sharper focus, clear objectives and clear action plans and, alongside that, continuing assessment of projects to ensure proper value for money and flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate and I congratulate all hon. Members who have taken part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a general consensus in the Committee that the scrutiny process is inadequate for the detailed documentation and complexity of projects and the amount of expenditure that we are discussing. Not having papers ready at an early stage hampers the work of the Committee. It is regrettable that the sitting had to start in a combative manner by the raising of a point of order, but there is no other mechanism by which to draw attention to the matter, which is serious. Having served on a European Standing Committee and having appeared before it as a Minister, I am conscious that if the detailed paperwork that Ministers hold is not provided to hon. Members well in advance of a sitting, it is not possible to pay the attention to detail that such matters require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several members of the Committee are familiar with the fourth framework programme. They will appreciate that there was little financial control and, moreover, little ability to hold the commissioner to account. I am still worried about that. The evaluation process on the fourth framework programme was very difficult, mainly because of the diffusion of the projects. Careful argument by the previous Government provided more definition for projects with more objectives and benchmarks. I think that there is agreement in the Committee that the Conservative Government paid attention to detail on the framework programmes and, as many hon. Members have acknowledged, British scientists and institutions did very well out of those programmes. I do not want any member of the Committee to go away
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
with the feeling that I want to oppose everything in Europe for the sake of opposition. I do not, but I want the attention paid to detail which such programmes warrant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the Minister's comments on the financial aspect of the negotiations. He said that he has high hopes, but he has given us no guarantees. We are not discussing a small budget; it amounts to some £12 billion. We do not know what the result of the commissioner's negotiations will be, but we know that we are almost in isolation in wanting the budget reduced. I was not satisfied with the Minister's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell) asked how the strong pound will affect the outcome of contracts under the fourth framework programme. I hope that the Minister will answer that interesting question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady endorses the Conservative Government's record in such matters.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, the hon. Gentleman must remember that I do not have to answer any questions about the previous Government. The hon. Gentleman's party is now in government. If Labour Back Benchers spend too much time scrutinising the Opposition, they will fail properly to scrutinise the Government, which is what the hon. Gentleman should be doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have established that the veto is going out of the door and that we have sold out to Europe. I want the Minister to have as much time as possible in which to reply. He asked me for 15 minutes and I shall be generous and ensure that he has a minimum of 15 minutes. I am worried about other matters that we have had no time to examine in Committee. I am worried about what will happen to the joint research centre and what he will suggest for changes to structure. How does he intend to manage the participation of SMEs in the fifth framework? As we have said, others have done well, so how shall we measure and judge that in future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted the Minister to go into detail about the relationship with other programmes, such as Eureka. How will he tackle the specification of projects? I am sure that he will admit that, in the framing of projects, particular industries are favoured. The car of the future comes to mind, which undoubtedly favoured the French car industry. How will the hon. Gentleman tackle such problems? If he does not have time to tell us that in his winding-up speech, perhaps he could answer such questions in detail in writing to me and other members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that I am not a permanent member of the Committee, Mr. Maxton. I have enjoyed speaking under your chairmanship and I thank you for your indulgence. I must inform you, however, that we shall divide the Committee because we have not been satisfied that the Minister has the necessary backbone

and tools in his armoury to negotiate on our behalf in Europe on this subject. We wish him well in his negotiations; we would wish any Minister representing this country well in any negotiations. However, we are not convinced that the Minister will do anything other than go naked into the negotiating room. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reply to my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.42 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank members of the Committee for their comments. I, too, am hidebound by the structure and shape of the Committee. I am invited here to make a statement and to give evidence, as it were, after which we have a debate. I consider that, to some extent, there has not been sufficient time to cover some of the detail. It took us about half an hour to get to the detail during which time we discussed, rather unhelpfully, the veto.

I emphasise that the job of the Committee is to examine matters and I am more than happy to answer questions at any time in our proceedings, so that the Government can be held to account and scrutinised. I stress that there is a timetable for the negotiations on the fifth framework programme. The Council aims to achieve full agreement on the main issues in November and to reach a common position on the framework decision in February, after which there will be conciliation with the European Parliament in September next year. There will be plenty of time for us to scrutinise matters and for the Committee to call the Government to account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a case of there being a blank cheque or no reporting back. Even during the course of the negotiations on the fourth framework programme, a memorandum was sent to the Committee and such action will continue. There will be a further opportunity to scrutinise issues, not least because it is likely that the Commission will issue a revised proposal in the new year, which will take account of the positions of the Council and the European Parliament. The matter will return to the Committee in the form of an explanatory memorandum in any event, in which proposals will be laid down for specific programmes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister undertake to use every opportunity to lengthen the scrutiny process before the document returns to the Committee for consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To some extent, I am in the hands of the Committee and the procedures of the House. It is for such processes to set up the framework by which we can be held to account. Although I am more than happy to respond positively at every opportunity, I cannot reshape how Committees are structured, how questions can be asked and responses given or set the number of times that I am invited to attend them. I am happy to attend sittings when I am invited to do so, but it is not in my gift to decide when we discuss certain matters. Throughout negotiations, there will be opportunities for the Committee to decide when and whether it wants to scrutinise the matters further. Such matters are in the Committee's hands, not mine.

I shall now scan through some of the matters that were raised with me in detail. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood referred to Euratom. I agree that that is both fusion and fission research and is part of the negotiations in content and value. However, we have not even reached the stage of debating individual items within those larger programmes and action shapes. It is a matter of shaking up the whole and then putting the shapes into categories. In a sense, the debate is not even at that stage because we cannot yet agree on the broad categories. However, we are trying to sharpen approaches to that, and I shall say a little more about that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) mentioned energy. Let me emphasise that energy is a key theme; it is one of the new programmes. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that we need a new drive to support renewable energy sources. I am tempted to respond by saying that that is also a theme in the new programme. Moreover, it is a theme in the Energy Council, on which I have the privilege of serving. Just as we need more joined-up thinking between Government Departments here in Britain, we need more interdepartmental thinking in Europe as well, to ensure that what happens in the energy section is linked to research, which I am not sure is the case now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government support the drive for renewable energy sources, which represent 2 per cent. of electricity generation, However, with added emphasis and effort, it could be much more. We could also do more at a European level. When the Energy Council has sorted out the gas market—I know that that is not the Committee's concern this morning—we intend immediately to move on to the Green Paper on renewable energies, and I shall do my best to ensure that some connection is made with the work that is being carried out in scienc and research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under framework four spending on nuclear energy will be £1.3 billion, whereas spending on non-nuclear energy will be £1.1 billion. The figures are not far apart, but we want enhanced support for renewables as we face the challenges of global warming, pollution and other environmental matters in the new century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe referred to the increase in the proposed budget for training mobility and researchers. My hon. Friend is absolutely right; there is a glitch in that budget, which is why we need to discuss the budget headings in detail. The Commission's proposal deals with rather more than training and mobility for researchers. Under that heading, it wants to include all socio-economic research. My impression is that some countries are using the heading of of socio-economic research to secure more funding for projects that were previously funded by the European social fund; they are using it as a slide-across budget, and that is not acceptable. We agree that more money should be invested in mobility and training, but let us not use that as a cover to sneak in other programmes. The increase will depend on the overall budget in that bracket, but my hon. Friend makes an important point and we should not neglect horizontal programmes.

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe went on to say that international co-operation should include the third world. Again, we need to be sure that there is linkage between what we do under the programmes. An entire European directorate—Directorates-General VIII, if I remember rightly—deals with the third world, so we must ask what is going on in its research programmes and how they relate to other work. Again, that is a matter of making connections, so that the Commission does not operate in isolation, duplicating and in some cases undermining the efforts of other departments. That is another point that I have learnt in today's debate, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing it to my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also mentioned translation. New technologies are tackling the problems of simultaneous translation. We could save money not only by restructuring the common agricultural policy budget and, indeed, all the Commission's operations by cutting the cost of translation. That might release funds for scientific research and development programmes. I simply mention that in the hope that it may yet come to fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about the shape of the programmes and whether we had challenged the Commission's views. I can assure him that there is a difference between member states and the Commission. The British view is at odds with that of the Commission; we are challenging the Commission, but so are other member states. There are signs that other member states are coming round to our approach, and conversations have been more positive and helpful than we might have imagined. My conversations, even about the budget, with Ministers from Germany, France and Austria have shown that those countries are moving our way. We should not take the view that it is simply Britain against the Commission. European member states, in partnership, are together challenging the Commission's view and saying, "We are in charge, not the Commission."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge mentioned small and medium-sized enterprises, as did the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan). We want a larger say for small and medium-sized enterprises and more access for users—I thought that I had already spelt that out in answer to questions. We want to ensure that the user advisory groups to the framework five programme have the right membership and power. My hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) asked about the make-up of the user groups and of the management committees. That is an important question: how will the programmes be managed? The user groups must have the right power, they must genuinely represent user communities and they must influence the management of the programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Britain, we have good models of such groups and practical examples of policy handling involving interested parties. We have structures here that we can use as a pattern for the framework 5 programme. There needs to be a balance between the Council and
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
the Commission, but we have strong support from several other member states for our approach to management, structure and budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Harlow mentioned attribution and universities. I hear clearly what he says and will consider the matter further. His comments were constructive; we ought not to be undermining other programmes. We are operating within the constraints of the discussion on the comprehensive spending review, but it is important to resolve such matters within that primary discussion, rather than to leave them until later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) made a helpful contribution to the debate by focusing on what is genuinely Europe-wide and what can be devolved under subsidiarity. He is right to say that we should not use the phrase "value added" as a kind of hold-all, and hope that something will come out of that vague notion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, by and large, the programmes have so far been successful and industrialists, universities and institutes consider them to have been beneficial. CREST analysed the impact of the programmes and 75 per cent. of the responses it received were positive. People felt that they were gaining from the programmes, that products were being brought to the marketplace and that value was literally being added, because work was being generated in whole new areas of technology and science. There is user confidence in the programme, but the hon. Member for West Dorset was right to insist that we should consider whether genuine value is being added for the whole of Europe—whether there is a European value in collaboration and how we measure it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that, under the procedures of this place, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham was able to jump up and ask why the documents were not on time. I will challenge my Department to ensure that it makes papers available well in advance to members of the Committee so that they have a chance to read them and are given guidance and an analysis of them. However, we are in a sort of structural bind, given the amount of documentation that we get from Europe, and we must find a way to carve through it. That challenge goes beyond me as a Minister because it is also a challenge to the way that the Scrutiny Committee works. I think that the spirit in which the hon. Member for West Dorset posed his question was how do we boil down this material and glean the essential issues. The way that the hon. Gentleman teased out the distinction between European value and subsidiarity is helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that generous offer. Can he put a time scale on it—undertaking to provide documents 10 working days, say, before the Committee meets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is practically possible, I see no reason why not. However, some of the material comes late to us from Europe and has to be processed through to the Committee. I am tempted to respond positively and say yes, so as to be helpful as possible.

Food, nutrition and health are best dealt with at European level. There are mutual benefits in having a European focus on matters such as large-scale population studies, the links between food and disease, and dietary patterns across Europe. All European states will benefit from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to target medical research in the fifth framework programme on combinations of new advanced technologies. Multidisciplinary advances in, for example, bioinformatics or biostatics will benefit from the study of a diverse population throughout Europe. So there are benefits in expanding survey areas beyond these islands. The Medical Research Council has taken an active part in the programme and strongly supports it. I have mentioned the genome project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a correction. The GSM is not solely dealt with in the other meetings of the Council of Ministers. There is provision in the draft document for research into
	<br><blockquote><p>"mobile and personal communications and systems",</p></blockquote>
but it is at a rudimentary stage and must be underpinned to ensure that the work of the Research Council is linked to what is happening in information technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Demonstrator projects are pre-competitive. The results are generally acceptable; it is not about picking winners. The aim is to show that promising technologies can work flat out. Such projects could be especially valuable in the energy sector. Clean energy technology immediately springs to mind as an area of research that could be helpfully developed within Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ethical considerations are rapidly moving up the agenda. We are aware of the concerns that have been triggered by advances in genetics. It is crucial to have the moral and ethical capacity to deal with those new developments. The public must understand what is going on not only in science but in the programmes that support it. Those concerns will be dealt with in the fifth framework programme as well as in Britain, where we shall take the lead in ethical discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to carry forward and update the safeguards on ethical issues that are already embodied in framework four. We are confident that we are making good headway. We are on the way to achieving many of our objectives. There is much to be done and the timetable is tight, but we want the shape of the programme and its management and monitoring to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
right, and we want to stay within the budget target that we have set. We shall argue strongly for that, but we want to go to the meetings with a positive attitude, saying that we have something to offer. Our experience could be useful in a European context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We approach the negotiations positively; we are determined to work not with enemies but partners. We must adopt a different tone and approach from that which I fear some members of the Committee were adopting at the beginning of the debate. I found it mildly depressing to be discussing a veto in the way that was done at the outset. Perhaps I misread the signs, but I got the impression that Conservative Members were approaching the matter from the wrong angle. They were keen not on getting to the detail but on saying that they did not want to be involved in the negotiations. So I am greateful that, in the end, we debated some of the details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been positive and constructive. The comments that have been made will sharpen our negotiations and, rightly, challenge us to think further and perhaps change some of the detailed approaches that we have adopted so far. I welcome other opportunities to be invited to debate such matters in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
