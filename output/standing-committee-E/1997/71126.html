	<p>[MR. BOWEN WELLS 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Harmful Tax Competition</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has chosen an important subject for debate. The two papers recommended for debate are the Commission's communications that set out a proposed package of measures for tackling harmful tax competition in the European Union. That package has not been finalised and is the subject of further discussion by the Council. However, it is the presidency's intention to reach political agreement on the package at the Economic and Finance Council on 1 December 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The package comprises three elements: first, a code of conduct on business taxation; secondly, an agreement to take action on the taxation of savings by non-residents; and thirdly, a proposal to eliminate the withholding of taxes on interest and royalty payments between companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission communication of 1 October contained a fourth element in the form of various indirect tax proposals. The Commission chose not to include those indirect measures in its later communication because of a lack of consensus between member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee's recommendation for debate focused particularly on the indirect tax measures which did not make it into the Commission's second communication. However, those measures will be pursued separately. Each of the indirect tax measures is, of course, subject to scrutiny in the ordinary way, as and when the Commission produces a considered proposal. Indeed, in a number of cases, proposals have already been made, and in each of those cases an explanatory memorandum has been submitted to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the elements of the package in the Commission's second communication, which is still on the table for agreement on 1 December. The code of conduct will be a useful step in tackling the problem of harmful tax competition, which creates significant economic distortions, both in Europe and globally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In negotiations over the code, the Government have been concerned to protect member states' competence in tax. We insisted that the code should be voluntary and without sanction and that it should include an explicit statement that it is without prejudice to national competence. The Government do not believe that the code concedes any increase in Community competence over tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
The Government believe that tax competition is generally a good thing and have secured recognition in the code for the valuable role of fair tax competition. We also recognise the damaging role of harmful tax competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fair tax competition exists when countries seek to become a generally low tax environment that attracts investment. Fair competition plays a very positive role in the European Union, as it helps to preserve the Union's external competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfair competition is quite different. Countries engage in unfair competition when they adopt zero or near-zero tax rates for special niche areas—often in which their economies do not currently engage—specifically to draw investment from elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that the code draws the line between fair and unfair tax competition in the right place. We believe that our own domestic tax system is fully consistent with the principles of the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The presidency will also be asked to reach agreement on the taxation of savings, with the aim of tackling tax evasion on interest from savings by nonresidents. The aim is to agree a set of principles on 1 December and to use those principles as the basis for a future directive. The United Kingdom believes that such tax evasion continues to constitute a significant problem and agrees that action at Community level is justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to protecting the competitiveness of the United Kingdom's financial service industry. The principles of the taxation of savings explicitly recognise the need to protect the competitiveness of European financial services. In particular, we have said that any future directive on the taxation of savings must exclude the Eurobond market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The taxation of savings principle envisages member states being obliged either to withhold tax on interest paid to non-residents or to provide information about non-residents' bank accounts to their home countries. The United Kingdom has made it clear that it would not accept a solution that obliged it to withhold tax, although we would be attracted to action based on the principles of exchange of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final element of the package is a proposal to abolish source country taxation on cross-border interest and royalty payments between companies in different member states. That is in line with what we aim to achieve in our bilateral tax treaties and what we continue to pursue through our double taxation treaties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am now ready to answer questions as outlined in my statement and in the memorandum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that their questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all hon. Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has indicated that she favours the code of conduct for business taxation and, to use the phrase in the explanatory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
memorandum, if she agrees it next week, she intends to honour it. In other words, the Government will be bound by it. Does she agree with all the provisions listed and described in the document before us. If not, what amendments will she propose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have made it clear in their negotiations that the code of conduct must be voluntary, that it is a political agreement, that it should be without sanctions, and that it should contain the explicit statement that it is without prejudice to national competence. The Government believe that the code does not concede an increase in Community competence over our tax issues. We also believe that our domestic system is fully consistent with those principles. That is how we intend to proceed in our negotiations on the code. We shall represent the best interests of the United Kingdom, and we will agree it only on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph N on page 14 of the draft code is headed "Geographical extension". It states:
	<br><q><p>"To this end it encourages Member States to stimulate their adoption"—</p></q>
of the code—
	<br><q><p>"at international level, and in particular to give active support to their adoption in their dependent or associated territories."</p></q>
What is the position of the Channel Islands? Can we hope that they, too, come under that heading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government made clear in discussions the need to recognise the limit of our jurisdiction on the tax regimes of our dependent territories. Any agreement would therefore be made under existing constitutional arrangements. The Government feel strongly that unfair tax competition should be dealt with internationally but it must be dealt with within our constitutional conventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph A of the draft code cites as a criterion
	<br><q><p>"the effective operation of the Single Market".</p></q>
May we assume that qualified majority voting would apply in the implementation of the code and in the decision-making process of the Council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The code is a voluntary agreement without legal basis; it is a political agreement. It has no sanctions. I repeat that it makes clear that the Government's national competence over tax issues is paramount. It makes no proposals for qualified majority voting on any matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee would unite behind the Minister's position in protecting British interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be joking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly serious. I am relieved that the communication is not legally binding in any sense, but is a voluntary political agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Some questions arise. Can the Minister assure us that there is no long-term threat to our British VAT regime or to our position on corporation taxation? I ask this because there have been two recent reductions in corporate taxation to encourage investment in Britain, and we would be interested to know whether there has been any reaction from the Commission and whether it has any view on Britain's distinctive VAT regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have made it clear in negotiations that direct taxation and fair tax competition—a broadly based low-tax regime—is good for competition, and, as a result of our negotiations, the code specifically reflects that commitment. My hon. Friend has my absolute assurance that the code cannot call into question our corporation tax rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful if I explained what happened to the indirect package of measures which covers the VAT committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original package had five indirect measures. The first related to the proposal to change the VAT committee and introduce qualified majority voting. The Government made it clear that we are determined to maintain unanimity on tax issues. I submitted an explanatory memorandum to that committee on 29 July setting out why we would oppose qualified majority voting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second element was VAT on passenger transport. The Government opposed it on the basis that we do not accept indirect tax as a pledge to maintain the zero rating. That has not re-emerged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third item was the energy products directive. The Government made it clear that we would not accept new taxes on domestic consumption of electricity and gas, and that there were other elements of the minimum rate with which we were unhappy. Again, I submitted an explanatory memorandum to the committee on 21 May.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the fifth measure, the Fiscalis programme—co-operation, and enhancement of co-operation between member states on the European Community dimensions of VAT and excise duties—I submitted an explanatory memorandum on 16 June and co-operation has been agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fifth and final proposal related to VAT on gold—a fraught subject that has been negotiated for some considerable time, and is still being negotiated. As soon as there are any proposals, the Committee will be fully informed by memorandum. The Committee can be reassured that, on direct and indirect tax, the Government have fought to maintain unanimity in voting and national competence. There is no question of Brussels being involved in setting tax rates in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to alcohol and tobacco taxation, we were keen that minimum rates should be discussed. That is not being pursued except at a high official level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary assures us that we are safe on indirect taxation. The evolution from the October document to the November document is unclear, as the explanatory memorandum in the bundle refers only to the later document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 14 on page 6 of the later document states that the Council is requested
	<br><q><p>"to give its support to the work on the other issues mentioned in paragraph 12".</p></q>
Paragraph 12 states that the Commission
	<br><q><p>"notes, in particular, the support that exists for making progress within the TPG on many of the 	<i>indirect taxation</i> elements identified in its Communication of I October".</p></q>
The Commission seems to be taking the position that if the Council of Ministers removes one of its objectives from the original draft it will slip back in a request, at the end of the concluding paragraph, for the Council to commit itself to working on the very issue that was removed. Does not the Financial Secretary feel that she is being railroaded by the Commission to go back round the loop on this issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that no one is being railroaded. Any proposal on indirect or direct tax is subject first to negotiation and consultation and then to sharp parliamentary scrutiny. At every stage, Parliament is informed. As I explained, three of the five proposals on indirect tax are the subject of memorandums to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's approach could do with some consistency. In 1988, the Conservative Government agreed to a Council resolution that aimed to eliminate and reduce the risks of distortion, tax evasion and tax avoidance through taxation saving. The Conservative Government agreed to pursue that on the basis of exchange of information. They confirmed that position again in May 1989, in June 1989, in December 1989 and yet again at the conclusion of the ECOFIN meeting in December 1989. I suggest that, when Conservative Members read the explanatory memorandum, they remember what they committed this country to. What we are discussing today is a much better deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I return to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) about the voting status of what we are discussing? We recognise that measure is being presented as voluntary, but the Commission clearly sees it as part of a centralising process for taxation. Paragraph 2 of the later communication from the Commission to the Council states:
	<br><q><p>"The global approach to taxation was launched at the informal ECOFIN meeting in Verona in April 1996 … This is in line with the Action Plan for the Single Market".</p></q>
Surely if it is in line with the action plan for the single market, it is subject to qualified majority voting, as are all single market matters. The Government are being disingenuous if they think that they can stick out against that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the explanatory memorandum and the code, there are constant references to member states. There is a political agreement between member states and I remind the hon. Gentleman that it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
voluntary. There are no sanctions and, therefore, no need for votes, qualified or otherwise. The code, rightly, accepts national competence on tax issues. The code will be voted on at ECOFIN on Monday, and if it does not receive a unanimous vote, it will not be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reinforce the point that we have been making continuously throughout the negotiations. The latest presidency text, which emerged only yesterday, states:
	<br><q><p>"A code of conduct is a political commitment and does not affect member states' rights and obligations in accordance with the treaty. Harmonisation of taxation is not an objective of the treaty."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. The Financial Secretary referred to three earlier explanatory memorandums, which she said had been submitted to the Committee. I am not aware of any such documents; I have not seen them and I do not know whether any other member of the Committee has seen them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Legislation Committee refers those documents to this Committee and we shall have to take that matter up with it. The documents before us this morning are for question and debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wells. If it will help members of the Committee to obtain copies of the memorandums, I can give them the reference numbers. They are: 9118/97, lodged on 29 July on the VAT Committee; energy products directive, 6793/97, lodged on 21 May; and 7478/97 lodged on 16 June.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wells. When referring to those documents, will the Financial Secretary have regard to the fact that we have not had a chance to read them? I ask her to keep that in mind when she is sheltering behind what is contained in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wells, I am not sheltering behind explanatory memorandums. The documents expose for scrutiny the Government's position and I am happy to answer questions on them, but they are not the subject of today's discussions. I assure the Committee that the Government take very seriously the submission of explanatory memorandums in full so that members of the Committee can see the Government's position on the relevant issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wells. In your ruling you said that it was up to the European Legislation Committee to provide us with those documents. Does that exonerate the Government and are you saying that they are not at fault? They clearly know all about the explanatory memorandums because the Minister has been reading references from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Wells. This has put us in a little difficulty. The Minister has asserted that the documents, from which she has quoted and which are obviously material to her
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
argument, have been made available to the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) doubts that. We are, therefore, in the invidious position of the Minister referring to documents as a crucial part of her response to questions, when hon. Members present do not have those documents available to them. Perhaps the Committee should be adjourned until the documents are available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to those points of order, the explanatory memorandums, to which the Minister has referred, are in the Vote Office and available to hon. Members. As I understood it, the Minister was calling to her aid explanatory memorandums which preceded the documents that the Committee is considering this morning. As I said, those are available to hon. Members in the Vote Office, should they wish to read them. However, we are considering the package of documents, not the explanatory memorandums to which the Minister referred. I therefore suggest that the Committee continue its questioning. I call Mr. Coaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you Mr. Wells. I have been bobbing up and down for some time to ask this question. Is not the voluntary code intended to even out distortions within the Community? If we did not take any action in that regard, would we not be abrogating our responsibility to act against distortions as we find them? I draw particular attention to the continuation of distortions which allow tax avoidance and tax evasion. The voluntary code of conduct makes clear that Governments are expected to work together to tackle those problems. Has the Minister any idea of how much tax avoidance and tax evasion is occurring within the Community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I tried to make clear, the Government agree that harmful competition creates economic distortion both in Europe and globally. I draw the Committee's attention to discussions in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on the subject. If the terms are right—as the Government insist that they must be—an EC code of conduct could be a useful step in tackling the problem. The Government have said that a code must not affect the respective competences of member states, that it must be voluntary and without sanction. and that it would have to be agreed in parallel with improving the application of existing state aids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that I do not have a figure for the scale of tax avoidance and evasion. Needless to say, our European partners also think that it is important to draw a distinction between fair and unfair competition, and believe that political agreement is the way forward. So far, the balance of the code and where the line is drawn in those areas is acceptable to the Government, but the final decision will be taken at ECOFIN.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, the Minister will be aware that the United States boasts not only a single market but a single currency. How does the Minister think that the United States has managed to reach its level of prosperity and success without the benefit of nonsense such as she is peddling today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we do not need to enter constitutional discussions about the difference between the United States, which is able to take decisions, and the European Union, which needs to reach political agreements. I will not go down that path, but if I need to repeat the point once more, I will. We are discussing a political agreement between member states. That agreement respects competence on taxation. It makes it clear that direct tax regimes are not within the remit of Brussels and that there are no sanctions. It also respects the position of national Parliaments. It is a good political agreement; it is no more than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the position? As I understand it, the proposal before us is that this nation will not tax investors from abroad differently from the way that we tax everybody else, thereby creating what a layman in these matters such as myself would call a tax haven. If that is the position, can she confirm that the code of conduct does not preclude us from giving everyone a particular tax break? For example, if we wanted further to reduce corporation tax or to provide other incentives to invest in industry, we would not be precluded from doing so under the code of conduct, so long as we treated everyone in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my hon. Friend that our tax system is transparent and that there can be no challenge to the regimes in the United Kingdom under the code, notwithstanding the fact that it is a political agreement, that there are no sanctions, or that it respects national competence. Even when reaching a political agreement, the Government believe that we must use the measure of what is best for Britain. That is why we have insisted that a distinction is drawn in the code between fair and unfair tax competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We think that the economy of Gibraltar has nothing to fear from the code.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought it was your turn, Mr. Wells.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not I but my right hon. Friend the Chancellor who will attend ECOFIN on Monday. He will take the decision in line with the principles under which we have pursued our obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that exercises some Opposition Members is whether the code represents a back door way into our tax system. The answer is no. It is a political agreement and it has no legal standing. Because it is not legally binding, it cannot be a basis for litigation through the European Court of Justice. It is a political code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the indirect tax measures because the Committee did so in the notes for today's debate and to make it clear that they were withdrawn because member states did not agree on the package. I explained why the proposal on the VAT committee was unacceptable: it introduced qualified majority voting. We have supplied a memorandum on that matter. The proposal on passenger transport, which is not now being pursued, required VAT to be levied. However, passenger transport is zero rated in our system, and we were not prepared to concede that. As I said, the energy products directive considered the extension to the domestic market. We could not accept that because it would cut across our policy of reducing VAT on fuel to 5 per cent. We would be undermining a pledge that we made in the election campaign and which we fulfilled in our first Budget. The Fiscalis programme is about enhancing co-operation. There is agreement on that and the explanatory memorandum has been issued. VAT on gold would be a targeted measure that needs careful handling because of UK interests. Nothing has emerged so far, even though we have been negotiating for several years, but when it does, Members will have full opportunities to scrutinise the measure in Comittee, after having seen the Government's memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the indirect tax measures only because they were included in the first draft but disappeared in the second. The Committee made that point in its papers. I did not refer to them in the explanatory memorandum because they were no longer in the document that was on the table for agreement. The Committee needs to consider only what is on the table now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say how, since the code is voluntary and therefore non-binding and since it talks about transfers of cash to individuals and companies across national boundaries, it is to be given the force of law within each member state if not by bilateral agreements between us and each member state? If it is to be given the force of law through such agreements, why is the code of conduct necessary at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First—I know I am repeating myself—the code does not have the force of law. It is a political agreement, not a legally binding agreement. When the Government give their word, they stick to it—as do all honourable people—whether in regard to political agreements or other matters. We need such an agreement for the same reason as we have pursued the discussions through the OECD with other partners and other countries on an international basis: unfair tax competition is a problem and it can be solved only by international political agreement. The code constitutes a first step in achieving that political agreement. However, I stress that it cannot be enforced in the sense that the hon. Member suggested because it is not legally binding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to ask my hon. Friend to repeat herself again, but would she comment on the reason for the proposed voluntary code? It is important that we reduce the significant distortions in the single market and the significant loss of revenue. We should also consider the increasing loss of tax yield, the effect on the labour market and so on. Are not those important reasons for having a code of conduct? Is it not also interesting that Opposition Members' questions imply that they are willing to sacrifice tax revenues in the name of some sort of Europhobia?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. If Opposition Members read the code and the memorandum rather than pursuing phantoms, they would have a better understanding of the proposals and of the Government's negotiating position in regard to the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a question of Britain remaining competitive. A broad-based low tax environment is important for business. The code seeks to ensure a fair and level playing field in which British interests can compete. The Government have always said that we want to create a fair tax system. Tackling tax evasion and harmful tax competition through the code, and the taxation of savings if those proposals flourish, will help us to do exactly that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put it to the Minister that with 23 per cent. of Britain's national income coming from our financial services, where attractive tax regimes are important, that is a dangerous political commitment to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the Labour Government under Harold Wilson who spotted that America had foolishly imposed the interest equalisation tax, which made what was then called Eurobanking attractive in London. That wise decision was a major reason for the City of London's success over the past 30 years. The financial services industry is international, but if its tax regimes are not taken care of it can go anywhere in the world. Someone mentioned employment, but it would be extremely bad for this country's employment not to retain flexibility on that front.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman was not here when I spoke about the importance of financial services in the City of London in my opening

speech. I said that the Government are committed to protecting the competitiveness of the United Kingdom's financial services industry. The principles of the taxation of savings explicitly recognise the need to protect the competitiveness of European financial services. The point that the hon. Gentleman makes is important. The Government have consulted banking concerns, and that is one reason for excluding Eurobonds should taxation of savings emerge as a directive. The Government have been negotiating on that since 1989 around much stronger principles than are on the table now, agreed by them when they were in government. However, in consultation on that it would be vital that that principle was supported. The hon. Gentleman should consider what is on the table now, rather than what he thinks may be there in future. If he has any faith in parliamentary democracy and the principle of scrutiny, he will understand that every measure will be taken to protect that competitiveness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even the most fanatical and wild-eyed Europhobe on the Opposition Benches should by now understand that the code is voluntary, because the Minister has mentioned it at least six times. To avoid our debate turning into a festival of Europhobia, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to accept for future discussions that there may be occasions when a voluntary agreement that we are committed to carry out in full is not necessarily superior to a compulsory agreement that everybody else will be required to carry out in full.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The importance of such a political agreement is that it shows that member states accept a series of propositions about harmful tax competition. I am pleased to be able to tell the Committee that the Government have taken a positive negotiating position on the distinctions between fair and unfair tax competition; the necessity of maintaining national competence; the importance of understanding collaboration; and the need to tackle some of the difficult issues that have not been and may not be resolved. That at least indicates a willingness to discuss the matter, which is a lot more than we have achieved before. The matter is important, but let us not overegg the pudding; the code represents no concession in terms of competence, unanimity or subidiarity, and it will not be enforceable through sanctions. To be honest, I would have thought that Conservative Members would have congratulated the Government on our positive success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her opening statement to clarify the document, the Minister said that the Government were against "a low tax environment"—I took down those words expressly. She was presumably referring to a particular jurisdiction within the Union. She then went on to say that such a situation was a problem. How is that a problem? Is not a low tax environment what brings our people additional prosperity and higher employment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
How can the Minister say that she will always put our nation's interest first, rather than the Community interest, when the code says that it would incorporate a review and monitoring process and would be capable of later development and refinement? In other words, the Community will put increasing pressure on the United Kingdom if our fiscal policies remain out of line with those of the rest of the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have misheard me. I drew a distinction between fair and unfair tax competition, and described a broad-based low tax environment as fair competition. I identified as unfair competition niche provisions and discriminatory regimes created in an economy—a very low tax regime separate from the rest of the country's tax regime and designed specifically to attract mobile capital. I did not mean to refer to the broad-based corporation tax of the UK, which applies to everyone. That is not a niche regime, it is this country's tax system. Unfair competition is where little tax havens are created within countries to attract money; the UK does not do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I return my hon. Friend the Minister to indirect taxation for a moment? She explained that indirect taxation measures have been taken off the table because unanimity could not be reached. As the representative of a constituency that suffers dreadfully from bootlegging, are there any plans for us to press for indirect taxation measures to be brought back to the table as soon as possible? Can she assure me that the Chancellor will be making that case at ECOFIN on 1 December?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The minimum rates of alcohol and tobacco taxation were not included in the package, although we sought, while objecting to some elements of the package, to get them included. When the indirect tax package was removed, we continued to make the point that we require attention to be paid to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A high-level official European Union group has been established which is due to report in March on specific points concerning fraud and evasion in relation to tobacco and alcohol taxation. We are making a positive contribution to those discussions and are pursuing the best interests of the United Kingdom. The Chancellor and I continue to stress those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have undertaken the review of alcohol and tobacco -taxation that the Chancellor announced in his July Budget. That is running in parallel; it is important that information is shared and I assure my hon. Friend that the Government are actively pursuing tht policy. The Committee will be informed as soon as there is something to report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, I asked the Minister whether she could identify the items in the draft code with which she disagreed, as the Government will commit themselves to it on Monday. She replied only by listing a number of principles, including the voluntary principle. As the Government have said that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
they will be bound by the code and will honour it in all circumstances, the distinction between legal and voluntary force will mean little in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask a specific question? On Monday, will the Government accept paragraph J in the draft code, which commits member states to re-examine their existing laws and established practices. If the code is accepted, member states will have to
	<br><q><p>"amend such laws and practices as necessary, with a view to eliminating any harmful measures".</p></q>
The Financial Secretary must already have identified British tax and other measures which are deemed to be harmful and which require amendment. Will she now list them, as on Monday the Government will commit themselves to the new tax instrument, which will be binding on their behaviour and actions? We need to know which laws and practices she wants to eliminate under the paragraph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have more faith in—and more detailed information of—the British tax system than the right hon. Gentleman does. There are no harmful measures in the British tax system that would be subject to the rollback. The Government have accepted that paragraph and, at ECOFIN on Monday, the Chancellor will decide whether the code delivers the objectives that I have clearly laid out today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman will not want to, but he really should give the Government more credit on their understanding of how our tax system works. When the Conservative party were in government, the practice was to claim that Britain did not have such harmful, unfair tax competition measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the previous Government's tax policies were harmful to employment? One of the Labour Government's pledges is to get people back to work, and will not the agreement we are discussing help create a more employment-friendly tax environment in the European Community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should not read too much into the code and its likely impact. It is a political agreement that the code is an important part of making the market work better and I would have thought that the Conservative party, who introduced and signed up to the single market when it was in government, would welcome that. With our low-rate and broad-base tax regime, Britain is entirely within the code; we have nothing to fear from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Council extracted from the Commission a commitment to a communication on application of the state aid rules to fiscal measures. Does the Financial Secretary think that it is acceptable for the Commission to say in paragraph 13 of the explanatory memorandum that the consultation process on guidelines will occur in
	<br><q><p>"parallel with the implementation of the package"?</p></q>
Would it not have been more appropriate for the consultation to have taken place beforehand, so that the state aid rules for fiscal measures could have been implemented in parallel with the document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. In negotiations, the Government have actively pursued the operation of state aid and the criteria involved. We have asked for a rigorous and proper application of the rules, and for transparency in that application. It was agreed as part of the package with the code that that should be done in parallel. The code—and, more important, the scrutiny of the state aid applications—is an important package, and we shall continue to pursue it. It was no mean feat to reach agreement on the scrutiny of the state aid rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary reassured me when she said that there is no long-term threat to Britain's independence in setting its own tax rates and tax regime. Let us bear in mind those who thought that too much economic power would seep from member state Governments to the Commission. As that is not happening, and will not do so as a result of the communication, surely such people will now support the Financial Secretary's statements and the Government's position. We are putting down a marker, saying that we have independence. Do other member states feel as strongly as we do in wanting to continue to determine their tax rates and tax regimes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Member states jealously protect their national competence in tax issues—and rightly so. Indeed, the commitment under the code to respect that is important. It has been argued that, in agreeing the code and saying that there are no harmful measures in the United Kingdom, we should still fear scrutiny under it. That begs the question, why should we agree it? Opposition Members are missing the point: we want to tackle the other countries' harmful measures that damage competitiveness and the performance of our industries, of which there are examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commissioner Van Miert has undertaken consultation on state aid. I encourage all members of the Committee to read his statements. We have nothing to fear from the code, but the point of reaching political agreement is that we want to encourage other European member states to review some of their measures that we consider unfair tax competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister know that the Court will not use the agreement as part of a future judgement? There are plenty of examples of it using intergovernmental agreements in that way, especially when it can point to a wider context, which—under the document, is centralisation of taxation. The Commission has made no secret of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no obligation in the treaty to harmonise direct taxes. This is a political agreement that has no force. It has no legal status and contains no sanctions. Therefore it cannot be cited through the ECJ. That opinion is shared by other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been most cautious in ensuring that a political agreement is exactly what we have negotiated. If that is delivered, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will decide on Monday whether to agree the code, and agreement will be unanimous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><q><p>That the Committee takes note of the Commission Communications (10427/97) of 1st October 1997 	<i>Towards tax co-ordination in the European Union—a package to tackle harmful tax competition</i> and (COM(97)564) of 5th November 1997 	<i>A package to tackle harmful tax competition in the European Union;</i> and supports the Government's position as set out in its Explanatory Memorandum (COM 97(564)) of 17th November 1997.—[	<i>Dawn Primarolo.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the motion, line 1, leave out from `Committee' to end and add—
	<br><q><p>'declines to take note of a package which would commit the Government to repeal or amend United Kingdom laws deemed to constitute "harmful tax competition" and which would also require United Kingdom financial institutions to provide information to other member states, on which there has been inadequate consultation and assessment of cost.'</p></q>
The motion is interesting, and ought to worry members of the Committee. The European Commission has made no secret of its intention to harmonise taxes across the EU—partly, but not solely, because of the requirements of economic and monetary union. Indirect taxes are no longer in this package although they are being pursued elsewhere; the Government will be asked on Monday to continue that task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even outside the scope of indirect taxes, the Commission has always believed that monetary union, and in particular a single European currency, is possible only in an economic union entailing a taxation union, with centralised control and powers over at least some taxes, and elements of the budget. That was the conclusion of the MacDougall report—named after a British economist, who was chairman of the EEC Study Group—as long ago as 1987, which stated clearly that the only hope for a single European currency was the centralisation and harmonisation of budgetary and taxation powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By implication, the right hon. Gentleman is saying that harmonisation of taxation is a bad idea. Can he explain why, when his Government were in power, they used it as an excuse for introducing VAT on fuel?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not used as a reason for increasing VAT on fuel. I was in the House at the time—the hon. Gentleman was not—and was privy to those discussions and debates. That argument was not used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has never disguised the fact that its ambition was to harmonise taxation. It is significant that in paragraph P of the so-called revision clause to the original document, the Council was invited to review the tax code after two years and at that stage
	<br><q><p>"consider whether the provisions"—</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
of paragraph E in the draft code—
	<br><q><p>"should be extended to include a Member State's general business tax regime where the level of taxation is significantly lower than the Community average."</p></q>
The implication is that low taxes are a threat to the tax unity and economic unity of the EU, and that they should be harmonised upwards. That paragraph was expunged in a later draft, but that was what the Commission intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman accept that the reason that it was removed from the second draft was that no agreement was reached about its conclusion and that therefore his argument is spurious?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. I was making a different point, and I ask the hon. Lady to listen. I was pointing out the ambitions and intentions of the Commission in this respect. The Select Committee deprecated the fact that the hon. Lady and the Government did not supply an explanatory memorandum relating to that earlier document because the Select Committee was very interested in the changes that had taken place between the original and later drafts. On the fact that the Minister's explanatory memorandum covered only the latter version of the package, the Select Committee said:
	<br><q><p>"This is less than helpful"</p></q>
We are quite used in this Committee to the Government providing inadequate information. This is another example of that and the Government were criticised by the all-party Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is the dynamic behind the drive to harmonisation and the European Parliament is part of that. Earlier this year, the European Parliament passed some legislation requesting the abolition of unanimity in taxation matters. A report published in September states that the European Parliament
	<br><q><p>"demands that in future the questions of corporate taxation be a competence of the Union."</p></q>
It also called for
	<br><q><p>"majority voting in the Council on all issues concerning tax harmonisation".</p></q>
That report dates from May this year. What the European Parliament and the Commission want, they tend to get. It is a matter of historical record that every treaty advances the competence of the European Union and the powers of the European Parliament, in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister hopes to buy off our concerns by saying constantly that the code is voluntary. But she has made it clear, both in writing and orally that when the code of conduct is signed, it will be binding on the Government. She will be committed to it and will honour it. On Monday, we shall be signing up effectively to a new European tax instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman suggesting that the Government should give their word in bad faith and then break it? Is that how he expects business to be done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the hon. Lady is not listening to what I am saying. She is the one who intends to sign up to the code. We are not going to be negotiating. If she signs it, she will honour it, which is absolutely proper, but it will then be binding on the Government. The distinction between that and the supposed voluntary nature is completely theoretical. In practice, it means almost nothing. We shall be committing the Government to a new tax code of conduct that they will adhere to and honour in all its particulars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the reason why we asked specific questions about exactly what the Financial Secretary was signing up to and what she disagreed with. All she said was that there were three principles that she would pursue. She then said that it was for the Chancellor to decide whether the principles were reflected in the code. That is treating the Committee with contempt. We want to know now whether the three principles, which she listed, are fully reflected in the code; otherwise, it will be too late. This is the last chance for hon. Members, and the people whom we represent, to alter, amend or change the code in any way. We want to know now whether the principles that she advanced are reflected in the code. If not, what changes will the Government be requesting or signing up to on Monday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman restricting himself to a purely interrogative vein or does he have suggestions to make about the inadequacies of the code?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would amend the tax code at great length. If we had enough time and it was in order, I would do so. I am not the Minister now. The hon. Gentleman must address his question to the Minister if he is concerned about the tax code. I regret that I am not going to Brussels on Monday to stand up for the interests of the British taxpayer. The hon. Lady and her right hon. Friends will do so, so we need to ask her the questions and she must answer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, on the question of corporation tax, the explanatory memorandum rather innocently states that UK rates of corporation tax could not be questioned under the code. It is not the rate that matters but the effective rate. Those of my hon. Friends who know about taxation—some are members of the Committee—know that the reliefs and allowances granted to a company under domestic tax law alter the effective paid rate of corporation tax rather than the nominal rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many rates, both existing or prospective, are governed by allowances and reliefs, which could bring us into conflict with the code. For instance, if we decided deliberately to attract overseas investments to this country, perhaps to help an employment blackspot or an assisted area, we could offer special reliefs and allowances. They would not alter the nominal rate of corporation tax but could affect the actual tax to be paid by investing companies. That may fall foul of the tax code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there was nothing illegal about that and that it could never be taken to court. I remind her that article 5 of the treaty provides that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
member states should abstain from any measure that could jeopardise the attainment of the treaty's overall objectives. If the European Court of Justice concluded that, in such an instance, we were inhibiting the attainment of monetary union by taking such measures within our tax competence, they could indeed take us to court for being in breach of what is supposedly a voluntary tax code. The Minister is being far too innocent about the underlying motivation behind the code, which is already reflected in provisions in the treaty, notably in article 5, and the possible legal and penal implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is making some extremely important points; I hope, Mr. Wells, that the Committee is listening. Is it not the ratchet effect, the continued pressure, that such a political agreement will have on the Government that is most to be feared? I refer my right hon. Friend to the provision in paragraph P at the end of code, where it says that after two years the Council shall review the positions of the code and
	<br><q><p>"consider whether the provisions of paragraph E should be extended to include a Member State's general business tax regime where the level of taxation is significantly lower than the Community average."</p></q>
That is an implicit threat on the independent jurisdiction of the United Kingdom in business taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right: the fear of the occupied field is that once it is occupied—once an advance has been made into that area of taxation—it will become more explicitly legislative, and it will then move on. I have already suggested that existing European Commission reports recognise something that is always denied by this country. It is generally conceded on the Continent that monetary union will succeed only if there is a high degree of tax harmonisation and if there is a centralisation of taxation and budgetary measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because other hon. Members wish to participate in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall change gear for a moment, and speak on the taxation of savings and the apparent requirement that the Government want to sign up to, which will require financial institutions and banks to supply information about foreign deposit holders to the member state from whence they come or in which they are resident. Has the Minister any idea of the effect of that on the City or the cost of compliance? I draw her attention to a letter sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by Mr. Graham Mather, MEP, who is on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament. He wrote more than a month ago but has not yet received a reply. In his letter, he drew attention to the fact that the Customs 2000 programme, which is also an information exchange system, will be hugely expensive. The Commission has already requested an additional sum of more then 80 million ecu for the work on that information exchange. That gives an idea of the possible costs—indeed, the financial burden—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
that will be borne by United Kingdom financial institutions in having to provide information on their customers to foreign tax jurisdictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister about the consultation exercise that she must have undertaken before even contemplating adopting the proposal. The Committee has not been given a copy of the consultation document—presumably, the consultation was extensive. How many institutions were consulted? What publicity was given to the exercise, and what was the result?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The status of the City of London crucially depends on its not being over-regulated or over burdened with requests for information. If the City has to find out where all its overseas customers are based and provide other jurisdictions with information on tax, income and savings in a timely fashion, it could become extremely expensive. I should like the Minister to say what the overall costs are likely to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents state that a full compliance cost assessment has not been undertaken, which is extremely disturbing. It is no good undertaking such an assessment when the Government are committed to the proposal and are simply awaiting the directive. We must assess the costs before the political commitment is made and before the Government adopt the principle. I should like a copy of the compliance cost assessment, which must exist within the Treasury although it has not been made available to the Committee. We must have that information before we agree to the proposed motion. That is why we have tabled an amendment, which takes account of the point that I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief because I know that Europhobic Opposition Members enjoy savaging the European hound and that they will want to have their two-penny-worth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition spokesman, the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), implied that the Commission's hand was somehow tipped because the proposal was in an earlier document and, therefore, that we would be forced back to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Gentleman was speaking, I wondered what he would do when buying a motor-car. If the salesman asked him for £10,000, but, after some haggling, settled for £9,000, would he feel an overwhelming desire to return to the garage later and give the chap the other £1,000 because he asked for it in the first place? I suggest that he would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Negotiations have taken place, the Government have made their position clear and, therefore, these proposals differ from the earlier proposals—they have been improved in the interests of Britain. My hon. Friend the Minister and Government should be congratulated on that. We need not fear that we will be pulled back to an earlier position, unless that appeared to be in our interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
My understanding is that nothing in the proposal will prevent us from reforming our taxation system, so long as we treat everyone in the same way. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will reconfirm that later. Therefore, the proposal is entirely in our interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who has tried to encourage investment in this country using European funds and other measures, I know that it is difficult to find oneself in a Dutch auction with other countries and, indeed, regions of the United Kingdom—Opposition Members should not use this as another opportunity for a little Europhobia—because different proposals are put into packages and it is hard to attract the investor to one's own area because of what appear to be unfair incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more we harmonise such matters and the more we play on a level playing field, the better—it is important to treat everyone in the same way and not to go out of our way to create tax havens. My only criticism, if it can be called a criticism, of the documents is that indirect taxation should be reintroduced soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Government on pressing ahead with the matter and on talking to the Community and our partners about harmonisation on alcohol and tobacco. The sooner that we have that measure in front of us, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On Monday, the Chancellor will take the crucial decision in Brussels. The 	<i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings will not be published until tomorrow; that leaves virtually no time for Treasury Ministers or their advisers to take proper note of our arguments. As ever, they will trot across to Brussels and gladly sign up to what is put before them. I say gladly, because at heart they are enthusiastic about the proposals. They are not uneasy about acquiescing to the primacy of the European Union interest, over our own. They are essentially a quisling Government. That has to be faced and the Government will themselves, as the debates unfold, increasingly recognise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Is it in order for the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reply to that point of order, Mr. Wells?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly not a word that hon. Members should use to describe each other.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We use expressions such as "Gaullist" and "Petainist"—even "Majorite" was in common circulation. I therefore hope that the transference of a surname into an adjective to describe the Government will not be judged improper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was describing an important concept because the House has primacy in regard to taxation, and holding Ministers to account for the moneys that are raised for our constituents is our essential role—a role that has precipitated civil war and caused the secession of the American colonists. It is a matter of the utmost practical and emotional significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would therefore urge the Minister to be less disingenuous. When she talks about transparency, she should at least recognise that the Commission is anything but transparent in regard to tax matters; the committee with responsibility for VAT, for example, never publishes its minutes—and VAT is an important element in company taxation. Differential rates of VAT within the European Union are anathema to those who want to achieve fiscal harmonisation—a single currency—with an embryo European accord. On 16 January, my erstwhile colleague Phillip Oppenheim admitted in reply to an erstwhile Labour Member, Nigel Spearing, that the minutes are available only to members of the committee. We in this Committee have certainly never been informed about the deliberations of the VAT committee of the European Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such information as emerges from the Commission is most instructive on tax harmonisation. For example, the technical experts of DG XXI of the Commission produced a document only last year, 1156/96, which laid down features of a new VAT system with a common standard rate of about 18 per cent., an unspecified reduced rate, an end to the 0 per cent. rate of the United Kingdom and other countries and a central collection and enforcement administration, with a clearing house system sending funds to areas in the EU that required them—which I presume means those areas of the EU that the Commission thinks ought to be recipients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the background facts. It is no surprise that this Government, who consistently put the European Union's interests before those of our taxpayers and this country, are happy with that proposed political arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of VAT on domestic fuel, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells referred. I voted against the proposed increase on VAT on domestic fuel—thank goodness I did, and thank goodness that it did not go up to 17.5 per cent., as the then Government suggested. I did so in the knowledge that were a rate of 17.5 per cent. to be imposed, under European Union law there would be no way by which a British Government could lower it below 15 per cent. So we have already suffered a serious derogation. I presume that that, apart from fiscal implications, is why the Government were able to reduce VAT on insulation materials to 5 per cent. in the Chancellor's statement yesterday—a move that I welcome. I do not believe that the Government could have done the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
same—the Minister is nodding, but perhaps she will confirm this formally—for domestic fuel below the rate of 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No political agreement should be entered into lightly. The Financial Secretary has said that this is a political agreement that the Government want to honour. It leads irreversibly to an extension of Community competence in fiscal matters. It acknowledges the so-called benefit of fiscal harmonisation. It do not even accept the proposal for a directive on the taxation of savings. If we had a Government that were really looking after British interests, they would want the City of London to be a magnet to attract the maximum amount of savings. The more rules and regulations that inhibit the City's operations, the less effective it will be in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of a withholding tax has mercifully been ruled out by the Government, but the notion that financial institutions in the City of London should somehow get in touch with the country of origin of all transactions that lead to interest payments being made to people who are not resident in this country would lead to a plethora of work and administration that companies that are seeking to compete in the global marketplace could very well do without.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on the vexed matter of business taxation, I was delighted that in the Budget the Chancellor reduced corporation tax by 2 per cent. I was also pleased by his statement that from 1999 he will further reduce the main rate to 30 per cent. However, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells pointed out, there will be those in Europe who will be looking at the effective rate of business taxation—the whole gamut of measures that make the United Kingdom a competitive place. Surely we want to make the United Kingdom the venue par excellence for inward investment into Europe. Anything that militates against that—not only all the unnecessary burdens, costs and interferences, but the knowledge that supposedly sovereign Government decisions are pored over by experts and that our Finance Ministers have to trot across to Brussels to consult on matters that are properly theirs—is anathema to the management of a dynamic, forceful, expanding, low-tax regime, which is the means of generating prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not heard anyone suggest that we can create the favourable environment that the hon. Gentleman describes by giving tax rates to people from abroad that are not available to anyone else who wants to invest here, including our own citizens. As that is the only policy against which the proposals militate, why does he fear them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the draft code of conduct for business taxation is very different from mine. The first paragraph states:
	<br><q><p>"The Council condemns the use of tax measures that harm the Community interest, including the effective operation of the Single Market".</p></q>
If the single market it to be equitable in the eyes of Brussels, no advantage must be granted to any participating economy. If a Government are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
manifestly pursuing policies that are, according to Brussels, anti-communautaire and dramatically more favourable to business and investment, there will be howls of protest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will especially be the case when, in a few years' time, the impossibility of maintaining a single currency and single rate of interest with hugely divergent levels of economic performace, growth and overall achievement is demonstrated. The pressures for intervention through the mechanism that we are discussing, especially when the European single currency is established, will grow rather than diminish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the draft code refers to the single market, I will be surprised if there are no complaints to the European Court of Justice, despite the Financial Secretary's claim that the matter is beyond its competence. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells made perfectly plain, the matter will be regarded as falling within the court's competence, in as much as this is an instrument, albeit a political one, for closer integration and the achievement of the ever-closer union that is at the heart of the Maastricht treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the past and at today's sitting, the right hon. Member for Wells has offered some useful contributions and scrutiny. He does that, however, when he, not us, comes down from the partisan plain to get on the with the job at hand. He has done that on numerable occasions and has done so again today. Another right hon. Gentleman, who I am sure has other things to do, happily described himself a few Committees ago as an extremist, and there is no disparity on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had the real test last July and in the pre-Budget statement yesterday. We have before us details about eradicating harmful tax competition. We are not talking about harmonisation or the great imperialist scheme, as some hon. Members would have it. What would have changed in July and in the pre-Budget statement had we been operating under the code? According to Opposition Members, the hands of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor would have been completely tied and he would have to trot off to Europe—I think that was the phrase—before he could entertain the possibility of any fiscal measures. That is abject nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood wants to be offensive and throw his words around, I shall throw one back—not directly at him, because that might be out of order.

That is the reality behind the Europhobic position of some members of the Committee.

We are not talking about a great scheme to introduce fiscal unity tomorrow as a prelude to currency union the next day and world domination the day after that, as some hon. Members seem to think.

are. It is in Britain's interests that all member states sign up at the earliest opportunity to the code of conduct and adhere to it. In that way, we shall preserve our tax regime, which hon. Members have described; we shall not destroy or undermine it, but preserve it so that we are not done down at the expense of others. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my first excursion to the Committee—I am not a permanent member of it—and I am appalled by the standard of debate from Labour Members, particularly the Financial Secretary, who has not adequately responded to the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, the shadow Chief Secretary, and by my hon. Friends. The measure is of such importance that it should have been debated on the Floor of the House. The Financial Secretary will not attend the meeting on Monday; the Minister who will do so should be here to answer questions on the code: perhaps we would then be given full and frank answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code is not a small, technical matter, but the first occasion on which the European Commission has ventured into direct taxation. Therefore, agreeing the code is an enormous point of princicple. Once we have agreed it, the European Union will have been given carte blanche to venture down other roads. The Committee should examine the previous document. Words were excised before it came before the Committee, and that will be the case for the meeting on Monday. The difference between the documents is incredible, which reveals a great deal about the direction in which the Commission and some member states of the EU want to take direct tax harmonisation. The people of Europe would say the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But what good negotiators the Government are to have made a difference between the first and second drafts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that that is not the reason for the difference. The main reason for it is to avoid political embarrassment. Did the Government negotiate the deletion from the title page? Was that one of their great negotiating tactics? When the document went to various ECOFIN meetings over the past few months, its title was "Towards Tax Co-ordination in the European Union". But that has mysteriously disappeared, which reveals the direction that the EU wants to take. It is vital that the Government take the matter far more seriously. They are breaching the principle that the EU does not venture into direct taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the Financial Secretary shaking her head and saying that the code of conduct is voluntary. She has said that the Government intend to honour the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
code; therefore, it is more than voluntary. When a Government honour a voluntary code of conduct it becomes, in effect, the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come to provisions in the current document in a moment, but I refer the Financial Secretary to the final paragraph of the previous document. Paragraph P states:
	<br><q><p>"The Council shall review the provisions of this code when it has been in operation for two years."</p></q>
That phrase remains in the code. Paragraph P continues with the words that have been excised:
	<br><q><p>"It will at that stage consider whether the provisions of E"—</p></q>
the principles of the code appear in that paragraph—
	<br><q><p>"should be extended to include a Member State's general business tax regime where the level of taxation is significantly lower than the Community average."</p></q>
That is the ultimate aim of the proposers of the code and those words reveal the direction in which the EU wants to go. They want to ensure that the United Kingdom does not have a lower rate of corporation tax and a lower effective rate of corporation tax than other countries in the EU because they do not want other parts of the EU to lose business to the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the hon. Gentleman accept that that provision appeared in the previous document? We are being asked to take note of the current document. Doing that will not commit us to taking note of any other document or to going down that route. The fact that some people want to take it does not mean that we have to, now or in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the current document in a moment. We must examine the previous document because it was current until only recently. It reveals where the EU is headed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) is incorrect.

To form direct taxation policies, Britain will have to consult, negotiate with and seek permission from the European Union and its member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I come to paragraph E, I should say that a wider point of principle is involved—the concept of harmful tax competition, especially as it relates to business. Businesses do not have votes. International competition is the one downward pressure on corporate tax rates. There is no other pressure on corporations, because they do not vote. It is therefore quite easy for Governments to pile taxation on to businesses. Business taxes have to be kept down only because of the threat that companies will leave Britain. That has worked in Britain, where we have one of the lowest corporation tax regimes in the developed world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is welcome. As a result of yesterday's statement, British business will have to suffer £2 billion extra taxation per year for the next four years, through quarterly payments of advance corporation tax. That is incidental—the rate has come down, which is welcome. The hon. Gentleman should read the documents published by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary claimed in her limited answers that favourable tax regimes for non-residents cause economic distortion. She spoke of a global economic distortion. Does the hon. Lady believe that the code of conduct will apply throughout the world? Will it apply to Japan or to the United States? Investment comes to the European Union from those countries. We should attract that investment. I see no harm in a tax regime that is applicable to nonresidents, to attract investment from such countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a point of principle. What right have we to concede the decision making involved to the European Commission? Britain should decide whether it wants a favourable regime that is applicable to non-residents. With the voluntary code of conduct, the Government are handing jurisdiction on such decisions to the European Commission. It is wrong to say that the matter is minuscule—the Government are conceding a major point of principle. They and the people and businesses of Britain will regret that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph E of the code states:
	<br><q><p>"Member states commit themselves not to introduce new tax measures which arc harmful to the Community interest, including the effective operation of the single market."</p></q>
Will the Government honour that? If they do, we will lose control of certain aspects of our tax policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the second time that Opposition Members have quoted from that statement. I believe that it is part of the documents' general introduction. In annex 1, paragraphs D(i) to D(v), the hon. Gentleman will find specific details of what is regarded as harmful taxation. I do not believe that any members of the Committee would disagree with those definitions of harmful competition. Why do the Opposition keep banging away about a comment in the general introduction? The measures proposed by the document are clearly spelt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for this country to decide whether it wants measures that deal with what others regard as harmful tax competition, free of other member states' interference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Committee should ask whether the hon. Member for South Thanet was correct? My hon. Friend's assertion comes from paragraph E of the very same annex 1 from which the hon. Gentleman quoted. That annex is a draft resolution, and paragraph E carries its full force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. Paragraph G of the document says:
	<br><q><p>"In accordance with the principles of transparency and openness, Member States will inform each other of existing and proposed tax measures".</p></q>
The Government have claimed that that does not mean that they have to inform the European Commission and other member states of proposed tax measures before they make their Budget statement. However, many tax measures are not proposed tax measures when they are announced to the House in the Budget statement—they become actual tax measures then, by virtue of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the Government will be contravening the voluntary code if they do not inform other member states in the European Union of measures that will come into force once they are announced to the House in the Budget. Will the Financial Secretary abide by the code, or will she breach it? She cannot have it both ways when it comes to proposed measures that take effect on the day of the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is a huge and crucial extension of jurisdiction by the European Union into our direct tax measures. The Government should not agree to it on Monday; otherwise, we will be on a slippery slope to the European Union pushing up our tax rates, particularly business tax rates. British business and the British Government would not forgive the Government for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They are very relevant to our discussion about scrutiny, and fundamental to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are witnessing a clash of philosophies. Opposition Members—quite rightly, in their view—see the proposal as an attack on Britain's sovereignty, and believe that if we sign up to it we will voluntarily give away all sorts of powers over our taxation measures. Labour Members, however, believe that the countries of Europe will not have to give up any of their sovereignty but will be able to work together to overcome common problems and difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman genuinely believe that the Commission has no ambitions regarding direct taxation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do genuinely believe that. I believe that the Commission is trying to establish a tax regime, working with national Governments in the Community, which will enable all the peoples of Europe to prosper and benefit. There is a crucial clash of opinion about this issue in the Committee. Conservative Members suggested that it was somehow irrelevant to the debate, but it is fundamental to it. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) accused the Financial Secretary of not answering the question, but in my view—which I am sure is shared by my hon. Friends—she did. However, the hon. Gentleman did not agree with her answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between both sides of the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I was about to mention the approach adopted by the Financial Secretary and the Government, which my hon. Friends and I support. It is not about giving up national sovereignty or saying that we will accept anything proposed by the Commission. However, we believe that working with the Commission and establishing voluntary codes will be in the interests of not only the rest of Europe but our own people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that questions of national interest are tied up in this? It is not Europhobic, or even anti-European, to make a point that could just as well be made in any other member state in defence of its right to make decisions in line with the consent of its people. Does the hon. Gentleman also know that Mr. Tietmeyer has made it crystal clear that he regards it as inevitable that tax policy will follow the single market and that Chancellor Kohl has made it clear that the process of European integration and German national interests are to be seen as sides of the same coin? In other words, it would be naive, to say the least, to assume that other member states will not try to work the proposals to their advantage when at the moment we have a substantial advantage because of the lower tax regime and healthy economy developed by the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our view, there is not always a clash of community and national interests. We sometimes pursue the community's interest because to do so is in our national interest. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has made it clear that the agreements are voluntary. National sovereignty over taxation powers will not be eroded to give more powers to Brussels. We aim to work together to pursue national interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being extremely patient. He was developing an interesting argument and it would help the Committee to understand its conclusion. Is the hon. Gentleman asserting that if he were to be convinced that the agreement was destined to be much more than a voluntary agreement, his position on the document would change? If so, does he agree that the clash occurs over interpretation of facts, rather than over philosophy? It would help the Committee to know whether the brunt of his argument is that the agreement is voluntary, and therefore acceptable, or that it is acceptable even if it is not voluntary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I argue that it is voluntary and, therefore, fine. The interventions of Conservative Members clearly demonstrate my point about the clash of philosophies. Every time I try to make a point
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
about pursuing national interests through community co-operation, I hear responses such as those made by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make clear that important point about the clash of philosophies. As my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said in her opening remarks, we are trying to end some of the distortions that exist within the textbook tax regimes such as the unfair competition between member states. Should not we all be pursuing that objective? The document describes some of the consequences of that unfair competition and the problems that it causes. For example, it may have an impact on employment prospects in the community and in individual countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document states that unfair competition may reduce the possibility of pursuing some of the other objectives of the treaty, such as environmental policies. It also points out that the distortion of tax regimes between different countries is shifting the burden of taxation on to the less skilled, less mobile employees, while the burden is reduced for more highly mobile, highly skilled workers. Those difficulties and distortions outlined in the document clearly need to be addressed, as my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a pity that the later draft of the document says a good deal less about the reduction of taxation problems leading to a tax on labour? Does he agree also that a desirable objective for the Government would be to try to promote further discussions of that, to reduce the tax on labour throughout Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that point. That should be part of the scrutiny process and we are here in this Committee to discuss issues and matters of consequence that arise and which I am sure the Financial Secretary will take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point of my remarks was to highlight the philosophical difference between the arguments. Becaue the code of conduct is voluntary, it offers the UK a helpful way in which to promote objectives with which we would all agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, by working co-operatively with others we can pursue our national interest and do better for our country than we can by putting up barriers and trying to pursue a narrow, little Englander approach to these problems, which are more European than global.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members have referred to a clash of philosophies, and perhaps the debate was getting a little heated. I shall try to introduce a note of consensus—a sure way of doing that is to note for the record, with regret, that once again there are no Liberal Democrat Members with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already talked about the essential function of the Committee. I am certainly not a Europhobe, but I approach these matters with some scepticism. That is the right way in which to approach them—it is the only way we can hope to be helpful to Ministers as they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
prepare themselves to go to Brussels and do business with our partners in the Union. If we do not consider the issues critically, we are not doing our job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to support an observation that was made earlier about the timing of debates. We saw an example yesterday, and again today, of a debate being held just a couple of working days before the European meetings at which the issues were due to be decided. It would be more helpful if debates were held a little earlier—at least four or five days beforehand—to avoid the absence in the Standing Committee of the Minister who is due to attend the European meeting, which was the case yesterday and again today. Ministers would also have a chance to feed back to their colleagues anything useful that might come out of those discussions before the European meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary identified three key issues. She told us that the agreement would be voluntary and properly added that if the British Government entered into voluntary agreement, they would do so with the intention of sticking to it. My fear, however, is that some of our other partners may be rather less scrupulous about enforcing a voluntary agreement. I am afraid that once again we may see the United Kingdom acting properly while others act less properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What evidence does the hon. Gentleman have for saying that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our record on compliance with EU legislation is one of the best in the Community. I wonder whether Ministers who represent other member states have told their national Parliaments that they will scrupulously enforce the provision. I do not expect the Financial Secretary to provide an answer to that. It is probably uncontroversial to say that the UK is among the more scrupulous member states in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary told us that reference to indirect taxation had been taken out of the final draft. We have already spoken about the reference in paragraph 12 and the hon. Lady stated that indirect tax measures would be pursued separately, not as part of this measure. That gives me—and it should give Labour Members—further cause for concern. The document refers to zero-rated tax as something to be regarded as unfair and undesirable. However, hon. Members of all parties are attached to zero rating of certain products and services. It would be uncomfortable if the Commission were to start to press on existing zero ratings by means of indirect tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary outlined the three key principles with which the document deals. I wish to examine them to find out why we are sacrificing the hitherto established principle that taxation is dealt with at national rather than European level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first principle is the taxation of capital income. Will the Financial Secretary confirm that the European Union is being dragged into a debate that is essentially a matter between Germany and Luxembourg? It is the Germans and Luxemburgers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
who have a problem in that regard, and I should be reluctant to get the wider Community involved in the dispute if it meant that London would be damaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the measures proposed be effective? I doubt that people from Italy or France who want to conceal investment income from the tax authorities in their respective countries will be frightened by what is presented in the document. The City of London may have more to fear. Deposits either will be moved beyond the document's remit or they will be channelled through a place beyond that remit. The document concedes an important principle of taxation, and achieves little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum states that member states can choose between operating a withholding tax and providing information to the investor's home Government. It is made clear that the United Kingdom will choose the latter option, so I was alarmed when the Financial Secretary mentioned that a withholding tax might be negotiated into the provision in the future. Will she assure the Committee that the Chancellor will not allow such a provision to be negotiated in at the upcoming ECOFIN meeting or at any time in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the document will have the status of a convention? If so, it will not be immediately justiciable by the European Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does not my hon. Friend agree also that, under the document of direct effect, it is feasible to imagine circumstances under which an affected party goes to the European Court with a request that the document be justiciable? We have seen before that the European Court would be more than willing to intervene. Does he not agree therefore that, regardless of the actions of the Financial Secretary or the Chancellor, it is possible that a withholding tax could be imposed by the intervention of the European Court through the document of direct effect and an individual's application?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. He is absolutely right. I hope that the Financial Secretary will understand the thrust of the Opposition argument. We do not believe that she or the Chancellor is about to run off and give all the goodies away to Brussels, but we want to warn her of the danger that arises from the constant push for greater control at a European level. The Government must not be surprised by that. The Financial Secretary has assured the Committee, I am sure in good faith, that there will be no extension of Commission competence in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with the two other key principles. The matter of withholding taxes on royalty payments and interest payments between companies is uncontroversial—a technical measure—and need not detain us. But, as my hon. Friends have said, the code of conduct for business taxation potentially opens up an area in which the United Kingdom, to protect its national interests—investment, jobs, industry and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
business—should retain absolute discretion, without making special exemptions for foreign investors, to have a low tax, broad-based system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Financial Secretary acknowledge the fear that the language of the Commission document indicates that there are plans afoot to extend the competence of the European Union to bring about what those who want it would call a level playing field in tax regimes across the EU which would not tempt industry to locate in one member state rather than another because of tax breaks? The Financial Secretary might have read a newspaper report last week that a member of the French Government, perhaps unwisely, agreed with a radio phone-in caller who said that foreigners were in unfair competition with France because they had lower taxes. I am afraid that such popular sentiment exists in other EU countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there is also a risk that the European Court, which is considering that part of the code, will take the view, upon an application from a non-United Kingdom firm within the European Union, that a lower corporation tax constitutes a form of state aid? Does he also agree that we need clear assurance from the Financial Secretary that the Treasury's lawyers have investigated in depth whether that potential exists?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. He was unable to be here earlier, but we have discussed the state aid provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members believe that the European Commission has an agenda which it sees as perfectly legitimate. It is clear from the documents that the Commission believes that monetary union is in the bag and is moving to the next part of its agenda. Many observers, not only Conservative Members but people in the wider world, believe that monetary union will inevitably require harmonisation of taxation if it is to work. It is not unreasonable to probe to try to detect the beginnings of a Commission drive to that next stage, the harmonisation of taxes across the EU in support of monetary union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.43 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased by what the Financial Secretary said. I feel reassured by and happy with it. We should support the motion but oppose the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the proposal has arisen from a grand Euro design by someone in the Commission, from Germany or elsewhere, or from specific problems, not with Britain but between particular member states, is a moot point. Does the Financial Secretary have examples of specific problems that have given rise to the voluntary code of practice? Making voluntary arrangements between EU member states, rather than compelling them by centralised legislation, is a good precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a mistake to portray other member states as fanatically hell-bent on the total integration of their economies. In Germany, the president of the Bavarian Land parliament is making comments about Europe
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
that are not so different from those of Opposition Members and he is very influential in the governing party. The Bundesrat or upper house of the German Parliament recently voted unanimously to re-open the question of duty-free sales, which has already been voted unanimously through ECOFIN. Several member states have suggested that the abolition of duty free may be further delayed. Clearly, Germany is asserting its democratic, nation state right to decide on matters in Europe. Most member states—not just Britain—will jealously guard their independence in such matters. It is fundamental for member states that they establish their own tax regimes and tax rates and the fact that such matters are covered by the requirement for unanimity in ECOFIN is important. Such provisions will not be given away lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A small minority in Europe dreams of establishing the same tax regime across the whole of Europe, but it is highly unlikely that that will ever occur. Many much more powerful people and, in particular, nation state Governments will not accept that. Harmonising tax Europe wide will be difficult for those who favour it and it will be even more so after the widening of the EU, when more member states join. Harmonisation is extremely unlikely; indeed, some of the EU provisions will have to be re-examined when widening takes place.

I am pleased with the Financial Secretary's comments, I support the motion and I hope that the Committee will support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Wells argued that the proposals were a wicked plot by the Commission and that there was another deal behind it. In doing so, he suggested that the Government were either misleading the Committee or were too stupid to understand the situation, which is offensive to put it mildly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman prayed in aid the views of the European Parliament, but it has no powers over taxation. He also mentioned what the Commission may or may not like. The Government are not agreeing to any harmonisation in the present package, nor would we: the Prime Minister has made that clear; the Chancellor has made it clear; and I have repeatedly made it clear this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the right hon. Gentleman's question on article 5 is no. There is no connection and harmonisation of direct tax is not a community policy or a treaty objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also needed to know the Government's view of the package and I refer him to the memorandum, which makes it clear in the section on policy implications that the Government are pleased that the draft code of conduct recognises the positive effect of fair tax competition. That means that United Kingdom rates of corporation tax could not be questioned under the code. I hope that that is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
The right hon. Gentleman went on to ask about the principles, which are set out in paragraph 18. It is the Government's contention that they will be reflected in the code. It respects our competence over tax, functions in parallel with state aids and is a voluntary political agreement with no sanctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman spoke about the taxation of savings. Let us be clear about what has been agreed. In 1989, when the right hon. Gentleman was a Minister, his Government voted at ECOFIN in favour of a resolution that agreed a political framework for the limited exchange of information to deal with taxation on savings. Yet now he wants either to forget the past—collective amnesia is a problem for the Conservative party—or to paint an incredible picture that does not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the development of the five principles, the Government have had several discussions with representatives of the UK financial institutions about the impact of the measures. Throughout the negotiations, the Government have been determined to protect the UK's competitiveness. At this stage, member states are being asked to agree only on the need to tackle harmful taxation. Consultation will be extensive as proposals are brought forward, and the Committee will be given the opportunity to participate fully in that scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood referred to VAT on fuel. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman voted with the Labour Opposition to defeat the then Conservative Government. If VAT on fuel had been allowed to rise to 17.5 per cent., the present Government would not have been able to reduce it to 5 per cent., for which we had a clear mandate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there was the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), who said that nothing like the document had ever appeared before. Yet the previous Conservative Government agreed to a list of directives. There was the mergers directive and the parent and subsidiary company directive, both of 1990. Also in 1990, a multilateral convention set up a mechanism for transfer pricing disputes. Finally, there was 1989's Council regulation on European economic interest groupings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton went on to talk about the changes in the text. No amendments were made to avoid political embarrassment. They were made because the first document's reference to taxation levels significantly below the Community average were unacceptable to the Government. It was clear that we would not agree if the reference to corporation tax was retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) made a generous and thoughtful speech. I wondered whether any other Opposition member had bothered to read the documentation and understand its significance. Timing is a very important matter—[	<i>Interruption</i>] I do not want to damage the reputation of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge—he was just as crackers as the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
Timing is important. Negotiation has been continuing. The first document was produced and lodged with the Committee. We knew that the second document was imminent. I wrote to the Chairman of the Committee explaining that I could supply two explanatory memoranda but that that could be confusing and misleading. I explained that the Committee would want to scrutinise what was on the table for agreement. It was agreed that I would submit the explanatory memorandum as soon as possible after the arrival of the second document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what we did. I thank my officials for their heard work, and I thank the Committee for understanding that matters were moving very fast. To strengthen our negotiating position and get a code, we needed to engage in those discussions. We have done everything we can to ensure that the Committee's right to scrutiny is upheld and exercised here today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then made a point about indirect tax and the zero rate, which I thought was a bit of a cheek because it was the previous Government who gave up the zero rate of VAT on fuel. We have a clear manifesto commitment to maintain zero rates. We have a massice Parliamentary majority that supports that mandate. We have made it clear to our European partners, and they can see from the general election result, that we have a clear mandate and will defend our zero rates. The discussions on indirect tax were already taking place before the code emerged and will continue. The Committee will be given the right of full scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a large base of zero-rated products in this country, including food and children's clothes. There is a broad consensus in favour of the zero rate on food and the Financial Secretary has acknowledged that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to restate the pledge in our general election manifesto to stand by the zero rate. I am sure that that hon. Gentleman read that at the time, although he obviously did not follow the principle and vote Labour.

The attitude that wicked foreigners have a plan for us and that, like hapless lambs to the slaughter, we agree in good faith to one thing only to find that it is something else is absolutely ridiculous. It is about time that Conservative members took their heads out of the sand and started looking at what is going on in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The veto is sacrosanct—it was in our manifesto—and the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have made that clear. We keep our promises and we intend to keep that one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Is it in order for a Minister not to answer even one of the questions put to her by the Opposition spokesman? Is not it your duty to ensure that she answers at least one question? Obviously, I do not expect her to answer all those questions because most of them are unanswerable, but surely you, as our Chairman, with our interests at stake, should be sure that she at least tries to answer one of the direct questions that I asked. Is that too much to ask?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid it is. The right hon. Gentleman knows very well the rules of the Committee. The hon. Lady is entirely responsible for here speech and her contents. It is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman reads 	<i>Hansard,</i> I expect him to write an apology on the basis of the fact that I have dealt with article 5, the Community and the Parliament. I was just coming to the question of costs when he interrupted me. On the question of exchange of information and compliance costs, particularly in the taxation of savings, costs will depend on whether the information is provided automatically, comprehensively or on an ad hoc basis.

When we know what the directive contains, we will consult and then be able to assess its impact. Of course it is important to protect the competitiveness of the City of London. The Government do not need to be told to represent the interests of this country. It is clear that the code is voluntary, not legally binding, and protects our position with regard to direct control of our taxation system. All the points made by Conservative Members are totally spurious. I hope that the Committee endorses the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
