EC Preliminary Draft Budget for 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>[<i>Relevant documents:</i> European Community Documents Nos. COM(98)276, the Commission's Ninth Annual Report on the protection of the Community's financial interests and on the fight against fraud; COM(98)278, the Commission's work programme 1998–99 on the protection of the Community's financial interests; and SEC(98)774, the Commission's Report on SEM 2000 Stage III (Improved Co-operation with the Member States).]</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Last week, the Select Committee on European Legislation considered the documents that we are considering in Committee today and determined that they were sufficiently important to be debated on the Floor of the House rather than in Committee. The Government have seen fit blatantly to disregard that recommendation. Can you advise me, Mr. O'Hara, whether it is in order for a Select Committee's recommendation to be ignored in this way? What means are available to us to ensure that the recommendation is implemented and that we have a proper debate on the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The hon. Gentleman draws attention to a recommendation that was made last Wednesday. However, the Select Committee originally recommended that the debate should take place in Standing Committee. Bearing in mind the fact that the budget is time-sensitive because it has to be discussed before 17 July, arrangements were made for this Standing Committee to debate it. Furthermore, the European Legislation Select Committee published a report earlier this year in which it recommended that a Standing Committee was the most appropriate forum for scrutiny of the budget. Indeed, it described the Standing Committee format as a good one.<br><br>
I draw attention to the fact that the suggestion that the draft budget should be debated on the Floor of the House was first made last Wednesday. The hon. Gentleman is aware of the parliamentary timetable between now and 17 July. Is it in order for him to make such a suggestion, when he knows that perhaps the only way that space can be found in the parliamentary diary for a scrutiny debate would be to abandon the debate on landmines on Friday? That would disappoint the people of this country, who are anxious that the landmines convention should be ratified in memory of Diana, Princess of Wales.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the longest serving member of the Select Committee on European Legislation, I can assure the Minister that she has gravely misled the Committee in suggesting that this is the first time that a recommendation has been made that the budget should be debated on the Floor of the House. Indeed, until 18 months to two years ago, such debates were regularly taken on the Floor of the House. That was for a good reason: the matters under debate are fundamental to progress towards European union, and to the difficulties relating to our rebate and to other issues that may arise from that.<br><br>
Last Wednesday the Select Committee decided, in the light of all considerations, that the European preliminary draft budget should be taken on the Floor of the House, not in Standing Committee. Furthermore, the Modernisation Committee, which has just completed its deliberations and issued a report, has clarified the fact that a matter regarded by the Select Committee on European Legislation as of sufficient political importance to be taken on the Floor of the House, should be debated there.<br><br>
Against such a background, the Minister is in grave danger of misleading the Committee. It is perfectly clear that a matter of such importance should be taken on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Maclean <span class='memberconstituency'>(Penrith and The Border)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. This is an important matter. Idly casting aside the views of the Select Committee because it reported only last Wednesday would make a serious dent in parliamentary procedure.<br><br>
Such behaviour is unbecoming in the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. Her reference to the Landmines Bill was rather grubby. It is nonsense to say that if the draft budget is not scrutinised today, that Bill is the only legislation that could be affected.<br><br>
It is disgraceful for her to call in aid the memory of Her late Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, and to suggest that raising the issue before the Committee today is an attack on her memory.<br><br>
However, my main point of order, Mr. O'Hara, is this—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will stick to his main point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady raised the spectre of the Landmines Bill, which is a complete red herring. There is no God-given rule that hon. Members must go home at 10 o'clock every night; we used to discuss such business on the Floor of the House after 10 pm, and that is not a difficulty. The arrangements of the business managers are not the concern of the Committee. There should be ample scope to find time to deal with this matter on the Floor of the House, as the Select Committee recommended. Furthermore—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has well made his point.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0428">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Geraldine Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Morecambe and Lunesdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused. If this matter is so important to Opposition Members, why are not more of them here? I understand that any hon. Member can turn up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order, it is a question—but I am sure that it has been heard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is it not a fact that Select Committees can only make recommendations, and that it is for the Government to manage the business of the House, taking other pressures into account?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will respond to that point when I make my ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the point of order essentially that however we vote on the motion in this European Standing Committee, it will go through on the nod on the Floor of the House? Therefore we shall not be able to vote on that matter in the Chamber. However, if the debate took place on the Floor of the House, all hon. Members could vote on a matter of immense importance to their constituents. The management of our economy is affected by the European Union, and it is fit and proper for a legislature whose primary function is to control the raising of revenue by the Executive to vote on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon.</span><span class='membercontribution'> Members <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I take any more points of order, I must point out that some of them are observations on the original points of order, and they are taking away the time available for debate on the matter that concerns the hon. Members who first raised points of order.<br><br>
We have an hour for questions from when the Economic Secretary starts her speech, and the extra time before she begins will be taken away from the time available for the debate, which must conclude by 1 o'clock. If there are any more points of order, I will take them, but I will not take any more speeches on the points of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Like the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), I am a member of the Select Committee on European Legislation, and it is a fact that we changed the recommendation. The first recommendation was for a debate in this Standing Committee. The second recommendation last Wednesday, was for a debate on the Floor of the House. The lesson to be drawn from that is that if the Select Committee wants its views to be heard, it should be consistent in expressing them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I take the gravest exception—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Cash, you have already been called. The Chair is standing. If there are any other points of order, I will call someone else first.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is it not correct that any hon. Member who wishes to participate in these discussions can attend European Standing Committee B? Is it not also correct that attendence at the Committee is normally higher than would be normal after 10 o'clock for a debate on such matters in the Chamber?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is factually correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell) made a point about the recommendations of the Select Committee on European Legislation. Although it is true that there was a reversal of its decision, the subsequent decision stands in the report. Furthermore, in the light of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, we should note that there is a huge majority of Labour members on that Select Committee, and a Labour Chairman—even though, historically, its chairman was always a member of the Opposition. That causes much difficulty, because there was no resistance whatever from the majority of members of the Select Committee. That is a thoroughly bad state of affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I will take no more points of order. The matter has been well aired. It is not a matter for the Chair, but I let the points of order run because there was a serious point to be made. It was well made, and it has been recorded.<br><br>
Hon. Members can pursue the matter through other channels. The first recommendation was made on 8 June; it was revised last week. It is for the Government, not the Chair, to decide how the business of the House is ordered. The subject is before the Committee, and it is my business to chair the proceedings. I intend to do that now.</span></p>
<p>10.40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad, Mr. O'Hara, of the opportunity to appear before the Standing Committee. My party put great emphasis on scrutiny of the complicated issue of the European Union's preliminary draft budget.<br><br>
The Committee is rather unusual because any hon. Member can attend it and question the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But not vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons why so few Opposition Members have a vote is because the electorate spoke on 1 May 1997 and returned the Government with a substantial majority. That is called democracy, and the Government take it seriously.<br><br>
I take the Opposition to task for the points that they have made. They could have given up one of their Opposition days to allow the subject to be debated on the Floor of the House. However, when the section 5 debate took place on the Floor of the House, few Opposition Members attended. That was the most recent European matter to be debated on the Floor. Opposition Members have made spurious points that detract from the substance of our debate.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0429">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The European Community preliminary draft budget for 1999 is a serious and important document, especially as we look forward to the new challenges that the European Union faces. I am sure that members of the Committee have read the views that the Government have outlined in two explanatory memoranda. Therefore my introductory remarks will be brief.<br><br>
The 1999 budget covers the last year of the current financial perspectives—the headings under which EU finances are set. Therefore it presents an especially difficult problem for budgetary discipline, but also an important challenge for the future.<br><br>
The problem is caused by the weight of past commitments on the structural funds. As members of the Committee know, the current financial perspectives were agreed at the European Council meeting in Edinburgh in 1992. As my constituency is close to Edinburgh, I may add that that city did not make its usual impact in terms of budgetary rigour. Some decisions meant that, unlike other items in the budget, structural funds would have a privileged status. The Council promised to make available a specific amount of funding during the period of the current financial perspectives. The Council also decided that the funds would be made available at the rate at which member states said that they were able to use them. That has important implications for the budget that we are considering today.<br><br>
Partly because of hold-ups in 1993 in the Council and Parliament's agreeing the implementing regulations for the structural funds, but also because of difficulties on the ground, member states have been slower than expected to implement their allocation of funds. Consequently in 1999, the last year of the current financial perspective, the budget will have to bear the weight of a planned increase of some 2·5 billion euros of commitments originally foreseen in 1992, as well as an additional 3 billion euros of commitments that were not spent in the years 1994–1998. So altogether, the Council and European Parliament—the budgetary authority—have no choice, because of the decisions taken in Edinburgh in 1992, but to agree to a total increase in the 1999 budget of some 5·5 billion euros in structural funds. As a result, even if all other parts of the budget were frozen, the overall budget would still increase by some 6 per cent. in commitments and 3 per cent. in payments.<br><br>
That presents a significant challenge to budgetary discipline. As the Committee knows, over the last two years, the annual increase in budget payments has been restricted to about 1 per cent. Budgetary discipline is important, because limiting resources has a powerfull effect on improving the use to which those resources are put, and thereby helps to cut out mismanagement and fraud. It is also important because European expenditure places considerable strain on national budgets and cannot be exempt from the same rigorous approach that we apply to national expenditure.<br><br>
Especially this year, as we look forward to the new financial perspectives, budgetary discipline is crucial in view of the financial burdens that enlargement will place on the Union. Total EC expenditure is currently
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
limited by the own-resources ceiling of 1.2 per cent. of member states' GNP. Over the past four or five years, a disciplined approach to EC budgeting has enabled significant headroom to be opened up under this ceiling so that the Commission's proposals for 1999 now represent only 1.11 per cent. of member states' GNP. It is clear that for many member states, including ourselves, 1.27 per cent. represents the absolute limit for contributions to Europe.<br><br>
There is broad agreement among member states about the importance of enlargement—not only because of its economic impact but because of the wider significance of bringing the former east European bloc countries and others into the EU. If we are to make enlargement work and ensure that the own-resources ceiling remains durable for the next financial perspectives and beyond, we must do what we can to preserve and even increase that headroom in the final year before the new financial perspectives.<br><br>
The European Commission has proposed an increase of 6.47 per cent. in commitments and 3.38 per cent. in payments. By taking a firm approach and focusing on the real priorities, we can and must do better. That will be my priority when I attend the Budget Council in Brussels next Friday. However, I repeat that the burden of the structural funds causes an enormous problem for the 1999 budget and for that reason it is highly unlikely that we will do better than the 1.4 per cent. increase agreed last year. However, we shall do our best to improve on it.<br><br>
Finally, I should like to speak about the scrutiny procedure. It is a year since our last scrutiny debate, during which we heard some helpful suggestions—not least from the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), a distinguished former Treasury Minister—for improving the scrutiny process. I agreed with his perceptive remarks. Following last year's debate on the preliminary draft budget or PDB, as it is known, I agreed that there must be a better way of scrutinising budget documents. The Select Committee on European Legislation has adopted a new approach, based on the Government's recommendations, aimed at providing more timely and helpful information to Parliament.<br><br>
Our aim is to increase transparency and to get away from the mountain of often undicipherable paper work visited on members of the Committee—sometimes of such a volume as to inhibit proper scrutiny.<br><br>
The new arrangements include a separate explanatory memorandum focusing on revenue and fraud. Though the annual budget process cannot change the rules that govern the way in which the cost of the EC budget is shared between member states, we have an opportunity today to find out in more detail what is happening in the European budget. In the new process we have attempted to draw hon. Members' attention to the key parts of the PDB documents and to the Commission's budget overview in particular. I hope that hon. Members will as a result feel that they are better informed for the debate.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0430">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I am happy to take questions. Questions can sometimes be technical and wide ranging, and so as not to limit the time available too much, I shall try to deal with those that need lengthy explanations when I sum up. If any questions are particularly technical and specific I shall respond to hon. Members in writing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister commenced speaking at 10.40 and we have an hour at the most from that time for questions. In the interests of efficiency and expedition it would be convenient if hon. Members would keep their questions brief and succinct. Questions should be asked and answered one at a time—subject to the caveat that the Minister just gave—and, given the composition of the Committee, there should be time for hon. Members to ask more than one question each.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first ask the Economic Secretary about the level of United Kingdom contributions to the budget? She has shown in the explanatory memorandum that the level of our gross contributions remains roughly stable, and that once the abatement is taken into account it is set to fall slightly. However, the report produced by her Department shows that the net contribution to the EC budget is due to rise from an estimated outturn in 1997–98 of £2,305 million to a trended plan estimate of £3,025 million in 1998–99. Will the Economic Secretary tell us whether that is right? How does she reconcile those figures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a perceptive point; the hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to the Yellow Book figures that show the cash payments made and received by the United Kingdom in the budget year. Those are generally somewhat different from the underlying contributions because of the effect of exchange rate movements, which tend to shift some payments between years. The <i>Official Report</i> of our previous scrutiny debate on this matter will show that we discussed at length the impact of exchange rate fluctuation on the figures that we consider. In the end we do not pay more; the exchange rate obscures the issue. That is why an attempt has been made to show figures in sterling if possible in this year's budget documents, to achieve a clearer and more comprehensible picture of what the British taxpayer must pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first congratulate my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary on making the fight against fraud one of the priorities of the UK presidency? I assure her of Labour Members' support for her actions. Will my hon. Friend provide the Committee with more information about the outcome of the relevant measures? How successful have they been?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The fight against fraud was a key theme in the United Kingdom presidency. It relates not just to fraud as we understand it, but also to financial irregularities that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
occur as mistakes in the relevant process. The fight against fraud report and the Commission's anti-fraud work programme for 1998–99 were discussed at the 19 May ECOFIN Council, which examined the whole range of budget and financial management issues. That was important, because it raised the issue to be considered by the highest level of Finance Ministers across Europe. The Council supported the Commission's work and called for the inclusion of the principles of sound financial management and fraud protection in future programmes.<br><br>
For the first time, and as a result of our initiative, member states' responses to criticisms of them in the European Court of Auditors annual report were included in an ECOFIN discussion. That made it impossible to sweep the problem under the carpet, and Finance Ministers were required to consider fraud or irregularities that had been highlighted by the European Court of Auditors.<br><br>
Priority has been given to the work and the recommendations of the high level group on organised crime, because a number of highly publicised cases relating to Community funds have involved organised crime. Progress on that matter was reported to the Cardiff European Council of Heads of Government a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>
Progress has been made on legislation to improve the working of the transit system and on preparation of the new computerised transit system that is aimed at making the Community less vulnerable to fraud. That is an important development because in some countries the transit of goods across Europe is tracked manually. That means that it takes the authorities in those countries longer to check what has happened to materials.<br><br>
The fight against fraud is important at a time when the enlargement of the Community is likely to lead to significant changes to the common agricultural policy and to the structural funds regime. That point was recognised by the Cardiff European Council. The fight against fraud was a key part of the UK presidency, and there is now a growing recognition across Europe of the need for concerted effort.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary reflect on the report of the Select Committee on European Legislation and on the questions that it poses? It refers to the substantial cuts that have been made in the funds available for employment; they have been reduced by 15 per cent. to 34.7 million euro. At Edinburgh, a deal was reached—I would call it a stitch-up—on the arrangements for structural funds. It was designed to help Chancellor Kohl out of the hole that the tie-up between East and West Germany created.<br><br>
However, as the Select Committee points out, considerable cuts were agreed, and they were discussed at Luxembourg recently. In addition, the Economic Secretary has already said that she intends to exert pressure for a further reduction in the overall size of the budget. Structural funds in this country will be slashed, which is a matter of great sensitivity in Labour constituencies in coalfield communities. That process is being positively encouraged by the Government,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0431">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
and the Economic Secretary is kicking her own voters in the teeth. Such swingeing cuts will affect the Labour party substantially, and will also affect local government and all matters on which the European issue impinges on the domestic economy.<br><br>
Will the Economic Secretary tell us how she will explain to the voters of this country the swingeing cuts that will be experienced, contrary to the promises that were made? She is personally responsible because she is encouraging the pressure that will result in less money being made available to those voters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's approach is slightly schizophrenic. I would not describe the agreement made at Edinburgh as a "stitch-up"; that is more graphic language than I would use. However, I would say that it has created some significant problems, and that the previous Government came to a surprising conclusion when they discussed structural funds at that meeting.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman should bear in mind the fact that, because of the 1992 Edinburgh agreement, the payments we make for European Union structural funds are considerably more than the sums that we get back. I believe that the system works out at our paying £1.50 to get £1 back. That hardly seems a logical way forward. I am surprised that the previous Administration agreed to it. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) points out that not all his colleagues voted that way. I assure him that we are well aware of the schisms in the Conservative party on matters European.<br><br>
On the impact on employment, we must remember that my hon. Friend the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning is currently engaged in ensuring the development of Britain's domestic regional policy to help to secure employment. I must also make it abundantly clear that a key theme of the Government's relationship with Europe is the focusing on employment-related issues. During the Luxembourg summit, only a few days after our election in May 1997, we succeeded in highlighting the need to ensure the adoption of a legal base for the Luxembourg employment package; indeed it became a priority of the United Kingdom's presidency. That commits 150 million euros a year over three years to employment programmes, especially in the small and medium-sized enterprises sector. As a Member who represents a former coalfield, I can tell the hon. Member for Stone how important it is to establish new programmes that create work through small and medium-sized enterprises.<br><br>
Under our presidency, the United Kingdom has also virtually secured agreement to the European voluntary service, which will examine a way of advancing ancillary developments to our own welfare-to-work proposals. Further, the UK will work closely to ensure that improving employment propsects remains a high priority in the redesign of community programmes.<br><br>
We are currently looking hard, not only as a member state but more widely across Europe, at reform of the structural funds. We have to ensure that the funds are focused in such a way that they genuinely create employment in member states, but we have to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
see to it that the system is affordable, because without reform and a focusing of the structural funds the whole process of enlargement becomes unaffordable. That is one reason for our placing so much emphasis on those issues, as we have throughout our time in Government.<br><br>
The other side of the debate on the European currency is about putting in place the reforms needed to allow flexibility in economic reform—flexibility in labour markets as well as an increase in employment opportunities and transferable skills. The structural funds issue is not the only aspect; I was most surprised to hear the hon. Member for Stone of all people, suggest that there should be profligacy in the expenditure of structural funds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Spending on research and technology seems to have drifted upwards slightly since the fifth framework programme was agreed. I favour that if it leads to more research and technology, but not if it results in sloppier management of the R and T programme. I know that the Government have already done much to tighten up in that area, but can my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary expand on how we obtain value for money from that very large spend?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point that also leads us to one big issue among many that have been debated in Europe in the past year, the change from what is called the fourth framework programme to the fifth framework programme—FP4 and FP5, both R and D programmes. A number of research projects involving industry, academics and research providers have made bids for resources from the fourth framework.<br><br>
The new framework offers a different type of R and D opportunity from national programmes. It is pre-competitive and looks at collaborative research involving organisations from more than one member state in each project consortium, with the aim of complementing national R and D programmes. Indeed, the fifth framework programme, rather than merely throwing money at such projects without focusing it, will be output-focused rather than research focused; it will be aimed especially at addressing issues that have a particular European significance.<br><br>
We are hoping to see improvements in the management of the framework programme, and the Minister for Science, Energy and Industry hosted a ministerial colloquium in April to discuss the management issues relating to FP5. Among the outputs was an undertaking by the Commission to report annually to the Council to make sure that there is constant pressure on the management of FP5.<br><br>
The sum agreed in relation to FP5 represented a common position reached by the member states after a fair amount of brokering. Some member states advocated no increase in the budget over FP4, which was 13·2 billion ecu, and others advocated a budget of 16·7 billion ecu. The European Parliament, with which the budget is agreed as part of the co-decision process, has now backed the Commission in looking for a budget of 16·3 billion ecu. That is a considerable amount, and we would like the final settlements to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0432">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
about 14 billion ecu. There have to be savings in management and better targeting of resources. With that, the funds will certainly be sufficient and the new emphasis on focusing will deliver a much better outcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Cable</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister return to the UK contribution? A simple, perhaps deceptively simple, question is: how we can tell in terms of a common currency—a numeraire—whether we pay more or less than our fair share? The Treasury memorandum refers to the fact that the gross contribution share is approximately 18 per cent., but adds that the Treasury has a rule of thumb to the effect that it should be about 15 per cent. What does that rule of thumb mean and how is it derived? What does it tell us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am never very good on technical issues such as rules of thumb. I always point out that the discussions are very technical. The matter is more fully explored in the original supplementary explanatory memorandum, and if the hon. Gentleman wants to return to the question when he has looked at that, I will be happy to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a representative of a coalfield and former coalfield area, may I ask my hon. Friend to reflect on the fact that what many of the miners and ex-miners in my community do not understand is the common agricultural policy? As enlargement is not too far down the road, are we still continuing to press as hard as possible on that? We have had some success, but can my hon. Friend assure the Committee that we are continuing to press for reform of the CAP in the interests of the consumer, the taxpayer and everyone else—and in a way that also enables us to understand what is happening?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's view. Many people in this country have huge difficulty understanding the CAP and cannot understand why we spend money to make food more expensive. The Government, through the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, have been very aggressive in seeking to advance the case of CAP reform. At long last, we are beginning to see a consensus on the need for reform. That, like structural funds reform, will be a critical element of the enlargement negotiations.<br><br>
Looking at the different structures for enlargement in different parts of Europe—the wider Europe, as distinct from the EU—and using the rule of thumb that is so important in such discussions, it is easy to see the impact that the CAP could have if it were applied to the accession nations. It could dramatically thwart the intentions of the Community for efficient expenditure, including the specific expenditure in relation to the CAP.<br><br>
I turn now to the estimates in the budget this year. The Commission has produced a preliminary draft budget set at 40·4 billion ecu, which is about £27·4 billion. That is 4·8 billion ecu—£3·2 billion—below the guideline of 45·2 billion ecu, or £30·6 billion. Perhaps from now on I shall give the figures only in sterling, as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
they are getting complicated. The level is similar to that in the 1998 budget. However, several decisions have been taken in the Agriculture and Budget Councils that could have an effect on that figure, as could market developments.<br><br>
The Commission has said that it wishes to draw up a rectifying letter to the initial estimates that it made last autumn, and we shall monitor developments closely to ensure that a firm lid is kept on CAP expenditure. We are vigorously advocating the need for such a cap in the budget. The redesign and redefinition of the CAP and the structural policy will have to be a key element in future enlargement negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary has repeatedly stressed the importance that the Government attach to fighting fraud. However, the provision made in the budget for fighting fraud is to be cut by 25 per cent. How will that help in the fight?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point, because the budget provision could be misleading. One reason for the reduction is that it is now the responsibility of member states to meet the costs of the anti-fraud systems that the Commission paid to set up, which represent a significant increase in the anti-fraud effort. The fact that 3 per cent. of Commission staff are engaged specifically in finance and control activities also has to be taken into account. The establishment of the SEM 2000 initiative—for sound and efficient management—of which I know the hon. Gentleman is aware, means that anti-fraud activities are becoming absorbed within the overall operation of the Commission, which is as it should be.<br><br>
The fight against fraud should not be hung on a peg in the corner; it should be integral to all the Commission's activities. The whole of the budget of the European Court of Auditors must be taken into account when considering the anti-fraud objectives. Tougher regulation and enforcement, and increased commitment from member states to eliminate fraud, mean that more resources are being devoted to fighting fraud within each member state.<br><br>
It is important that we recognise that the budget lines on anti-fraud measures are not the only ones. We must continue to support the SEM 2000 initiative, which should result in a much greater anti-fraud culture in the Commission and mean that, over time, more resources will be devoted to better financial management. However, the onus in relation to antifraud work must rest with the member states. They have the responsibility of managing the bulk of the EC budget. Member states must recognise their responsibilities. That is why we made such a strong point during our presidency of ensuring that member states responded to the criticisms made of them in the Court of Auditors report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should all welcome the interest—albeit somewhat brief—that was shown by the hon. Member for Stone in our proceedings. Perhaps we shall hear more from him as his interest in Europe
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0433">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
develops. Obviously he is not used to the detailed scrutiny that is the normal practice in the Committee—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that this is question time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.<br><br>
Will the Minister confirm that although the hon. Member for Stone referred to a reduction of 6 million ecu in spending on social dialogue and employment, 420 million ecu have been allocated over the next three years for employment initiatives? In other words, contrary to the remarks made earlier, the budget represents a substantial increase in spending on employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is, as always, perceptive. The Committee must now be aware of how serious the hon. Member for Stone was about the significance of the debate, given that he has gone walkabout and is not at present to respond to that point.<br><br>
The emphasis on employment is increasing. That is shown not only by the budget, but in the much more fundamental way of trying to refocus the minds of the European Union and individual member states on employment issues. One of the most significant developments to come out of Luxembourg consists of the broad employment guidelines that member states must submit annually—a matter that was discussed among the Heads of Government in Cardiff a couple of weeks ago. A new emphasis has now been placed on employment matters throughout member states, which, as I said earlier, represent the other part of the jigsaw that must be applied if the single currency is to succeed and if the EU is to have sound, viable economic policies in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary may remember our exchange last year when I referred to the expenditure on tabacco subsidies. Does she know that those subsidies have increased by 5 million euros to 1 billion euros? Is she aware that the wine subsidy is 796 million euros, and the subsidy for olive oil is 2·18 billion euros, and the subsidy for silkworms and fibre plants is 856 million euros? Do her constituents and coal-mining communities approve of such expenditure? Will those subsidies help their family budgets?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I well remember that exchange, and I will never forget the hon. Gentleman describing the European Union as a "malign and alien force".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the hon. Gentleman has not changed his position.<br><br>
My constituents are anxious for the common agricultural policy to be reformed in such a way as to ensure that they and their families have access to cheap, high-quality food.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Olive oil.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman thinks that anything beyond the shores of Great Britain is slightly dodgy. Some of us have been known to use olive oil, but that does not mean that we necessarily approve of such a regime.<br><br>
Tobacco is an issue throughout the European Union, because many member states depend on the growing of tobacco for a considerable amount of employment. Eight member states grow tobacco and it is estimated that that creates 170,000 full-time jobs, including 135,000 growers. It is a key area for some member states, which is why they take a hard line on it. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood should bear in mind that it was his Government who entered into many such agreements, which we are now finding difficult to renegotiate.<br><br>
The tobacco reforms that have been introduced are not all that we would have liked. We wanted them to go much further. They are a step in the right direction, however, as they encourage tobacco growers to be more market-oriented, and provide a mechanism for reducing aid to tobacco production over time. We are vigilant about such matters, but we inherited a climate, to which the hon. Gentleman contributed, in which Britain's voice was not heard clearly because the members of the party then in government were too busy fighting among themselves.<br><br>
Since our election on 1 May last year, the major change that we have introduced is to enter into constructive discussion, and as a consequence, we are beginning to see sure signs of progress. For the record, I do not regard the European Union as a malign and alien force—nor, I am sure, do my constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that tobacco subsidies concern us all. Does my hon. Friend share my consternation that when the matter was debated in the European Parliament several months ago, action was proposed to cut tobacco subsidies but virtually every Conservative Member of the European Parliament voted against the proposal? Does not that underline the fact that what matters is not what people say but what they do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. It exposes much of the hypocrisy that we hear about; it also exposes the schisms that exist between Conservative Members of this Parliament and Conservative Members of the European Parliament. It is rare to find members of the Conservative party speaking with one voice, and between those in the European Parliament and those in the House of Commons, many speak about Europe with forked tongues. Indeed, I am surprised that Conservative Members have not suggested that there should be a budget line on forked tongues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I take the next question, I observe that although such is the nature of the subject that virtually any question would be in order, that last question was on the margins. I ask hon. Members to bear in mind the fact that we are debating the budget. I call Mr. Letwin.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0434">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I apologise for returning the Committee to the subject of the debate.<br><br>
In the light of our lengthy exchanges on the subject last year, I wonder whether the Economic Secretary would put on record exactly by how much the gap has risen, in percentage terms, between the appropriation for commitments and the appropriation for payments between last year's budget and this year's preliminary draft budget?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to give me a couple of minutes to work out the percentage figures. I shall answer him in a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Geraldine Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Opposition's problem is that they can do nothing but moan and whinge about Europe? They are completely negative. They never put forward constructive proposals. Does my hon. Friend agree that she is having to pick up the pieces to try to get a better deal for the British people, because some of the agreements made by the Opposition during their 18 years in government were not good for Britain? During the past year, the Government have done more for the people—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I let the hon. Lady speak so that I could see the shape of her question. However, I must rule that her question is slightly beyond the margins.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try not to whinge or moan, Mr. O'Hara. My question is about the possible effect of the introduction of the euro. In the past, the budget has been set in ecu and then translated into the various national currencies, so that during the year, variations occur around the ecu exchange rate. The ecu is a basket of currencies, so if one currency appreciates, the others depreciate.<br><br>
From 1 January 1999 the euro will be the domestic currency of the majority of member states. If sterling were to continue to appreciate, the Community would inherit a bonus from the United Kingdom's contribution, but if it were to depreciate—which is unlikely, given the increases in interest rates that we look forward to—the Community would suffer a decrease in revenue. Has any assessment been made of the impact of that on the Community's budget?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. From 1 January 1999 there will be much more transparency in relation to expenditure within member states and across member states, because 11 member states will be part of the euro-zone. That will help our deliberations when we come to scrutinise the budget next year, because the exchange rate will be set and we shall not find ourselves involved in the arcane discussions that we had last year about variations in the ecu basket exchange rate and the relativities between the currencies.<br><br>
As for the impact that that will have on the United Kingdom's contribution, I take this opportunity to say that whatever happens to the relativities, there is no question of the United Kingdom changing its position
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
on our abatement. We shall fight to maintain it should anyone challenge it—not that anyone has, but I put that explicit statement on the record.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked how the euro will impact on the Community. The Community will certainly benefit if the euro strengthens. Our contributions will be in sterling because we are an out country, and the sterling amounts will not change. That is the point that I was making earlier, when I was asked about the difference between Yellow Book and the figures contained in the explanatory memorandum and the budget. The considerable advantage is that those issues will become much clearer and more transparent, and there will not be the obscurity of exchange rate transactions.<br><br>
I shall take the opportunity to answer the point about percentages. I have the same difficulty as all the eight-year-olds who will not be allowed to use calculators. In 1998, the gap is 2.1 per cent. in commitments and 1.4 per cent. in payments. In 1999, the gap in commitments is 6.47 per cent. and in payments, 3.38 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to return to the issue of fraud? Is not it right that we have adopted qualified majority voting on anti-fraud legislation, whereas the previous Government did not? Is not it true, too, that the Government held the rest of the Community to ransom over BSE? How seriously could we take their approach to fraud when they were in government? Clearly, this Government are attempting to do something realistic about fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Qualified majority voting on fraud is important; it was discussed at the Luxembourg summit within weeks of the election. I am tempted to fulminate about BSE, but I suspect that I would get into trouble with you, Mr. O'Hara. The impact of BSE on our budget negotiations made it difficult to make the point that a new world had dawned in the United Kingdom with the election of a Labour Government and that we had people who were prepared to be constructive on such matters. We are now listened to and our ideas are accepted, whereas before we were laughed at.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In her introduction, the Minister explained that the increase in the budget was due in large part to the structural operations that are required under the 1992 Edinburgh agreement. She also suggested that she believed that the increase was too large and that she would seek to reduce it. Will she say in which areas she will look for reductions in the budget?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall seek to achieve reductions in every area in which there is an opportunity to do so, in line with our overall economic agenda. It is extremely frustrating to go into negotiations with our hands tied and to see a major hit in the budget in 1999 because of decisions made in 1992, and because of the failure to address certain issues between 1993 and our election to office in 1997.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0435">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
In areas such as agriculture, we are confident that we can discuss the matter with the European Parliament in a way that will ensure a more realistic attitude to the CAP. I pay tribute to the European Parliament and its Budget Council, which has to deal with matters that can be a bit of a headache. Like ours, the European Parliament comprises elected representatives with constituents to answer to. It recognises the need for sound budgetary discipline, and that attitude has made budget negotiations much easier than they have been in previous years. In my six months as president of the Budget Council during the UK presidency, I found the European Parliament very supportive of the campaign for budgetary rigour, which is important because the European Parliament has the ultimate power, and can blow all the negotiations out of the water if they fail to impose the budgetary rigour that is expected from our Governments as member states.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I welcome the statement by my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and her subsequent remarks, especially her emphasis on the fact that the United Kingdom abatement is nonnegotiable. That is a fundamental point. Britain's net contribution varies from year to year, and is sometimes affected by, for example, changes in currencies. Will my hon. Friend reassure us that over the years, our net contribution will be contained in real terms so that our position does not become less equitable? Will the Government look to a future in which we may become net beneficiaries, or at least in which our budget contributions and receipts are in balance? We are the fourth poorest member of the EU.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That point is constantly before me. Although we are one of the heaviest contributors, we are one of the poorer countries in GDP terms. Even after abatement, we are approximately 11th in the list. My hon. Friend makes a good point, but I cannot give any assurances about net contributions in the longer term because it is impossible to do that. It is like being asked, "How long is a piece of string?"<br><br>
We are now entering an important phase of negotiations on future financial perspectives. I have repeatedly harked back to the difficulties that we have experienced because of the decisions made in Edinburgh in 1992 about structural funds.<br><br>
As we negotiate the new financial perspectives, it is important to ensure that we do not make our budgetary position untenable for the future. Therefore, repeated references to budgetary rigour are not simply the mantra that one would expect from Finance Ministers, who talk about such things even in their sleep.<br><br>
It is vital for the future that the EU acknowledge that the European taxpayer's money must be soundly looked after. If the EU enlarges, and increases the family of Europe by including the accession states, that process must be affordable. The financial perspectives, as well as negotiations on the common agricultural policy and on structural funds, will be critical for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it cause the Chair any distress if hon. Members removed their jackets?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman making a point of order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Would it cause the Chair any distress if hon. Members removed their jackets?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no strong feelings about the matter. I am more concerned to give Dr. Cable the opportunity to ask a question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Cable</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minster clarify fraud in the context of our discussion? What are the Government's priorities on fraud? Does the Minister accept that in the documentation there is a continuum covering everything from the theft of public money and organised crime, to irregularities, which include failing to fill in forms correctly? Can she provide a rough ballpark estimate of the definition of hard-core fraud in relation to the large sums that the Commission's statements bandy about? That would enable us to focus more on genuine problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely delighted by that perceptive question. It is difficult to separate figures for detected fraud from those for irregularities. They are obscured and lumped together beccause of the way in which the EU deals with those matters. Genuine fraud can be lumped together with a mere clerical or arithmetical error, such as adding up a column wrongly or putting a decimal point in the wrong place, and that is unhelpful.<br><br>
The figure for detected fraud and irregularity takes into account any infringement of a provision of Community law. It is also important to recognise that detected fraud gives no indication of the extent of undetected fraud. That is why, as I said earlier, the right ethos needs to be built into the framework of how the Commission does its work. It should focus on fraud and try to separate it out more distinctly.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the Council of Ministers has been concerned about the problem, and we specifically asked the Commission to distinguish between fraud and irregularities. It is frustrating not to have that clear distinction and I cannot see the logic of lumping arithmetic errors—in some cases very minor ones—together with major fraud issues that should be highlighted at Council and member state level with a view to eradication.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Part 3 of subsection B4 on the environment shows that environmental expenditure—certainly on commitments—is being reduced by 6.3 per cent. while payments will increase by only 0.4 per cent. Am I right in assuming that that is the result of much environmental expenditure having been moved into other budgets? If so, have the Government made an assessment of total spending on environmental matters? I do not expect the Minister to answer that off the top of her head, but if an assessment has been made, will she write to the Committee to inform us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. To the extent that environmental matters are passed across to other budgets, it becomes more difficult to assess. I shall certainly write to my hon. Friend, who has raised an

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
apposite issue. The EU has been concentrating more on environmental issues and the Commission faces greater pressure to take environmental matters into account in relation to various budget programmes. I will seek to separate environmental matters out, and if I can provide a clearer answer by the end of our deliberations this morning, I shall happily do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having slipped out of the Committee for a short time. Everyone knows that members of the Committee sometimes have to comply with other commitments, even when the Committee is sitting. I gather that some cheap remarks were made while I was out of the Room, but they do not bother me in the slightest.<br><br>
I should like to ask the Minister about appropriations for agriculture. This is a good opportunity for the Minister to answer some of the questions put by the Select Committee. My question is simple. The 32nd report of the Select Committee on European Legislation states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal that appropriations for agriculture should remain at their 1998 level is consistent with the Commission's proposal to roll over current support prices into 1998–99, providing that the Commission's assumptions about the market situation for major commodities and exchange rates are correct."</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister share those assumptions, and if not, what would be the consequences for the level of appropriations? I know that the Minister, having seen the report, has a standard answer—but I should like to hear it all the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether it is in order, Mr. O'Hara, for me to repeat an answer I gave earlier when the hon. Gentleman was conducting other business and was not present in Committee. Given that he regards these debates as so critically important, it must be relevant to point out that he has spent most of his time outside, not inside, this Committee. If he looks at <i>Hansard,</i> he will find the answer to his question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coaker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister join me in welcoming a further tranche of money for the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland, especially at this time? Will she continue to ensure that that money will be maintained in future budgets?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend raised that point. Money is being set aside for the peace and reconciliation programme in Northern Ireland, and 14 other member states have recognised the importance of peace there—not only for the United Kingdom but in the interest of peace of harmony throughout Europe. I should like to put on record the fact that the Government are grateful for the supportive approach of our fellow member states on this matter. We asked our colleagues for particular help over some of the issues relating to the legal basis for that expenditure and they were extremely helpful. That is a welcome signal, and I thank my hon. Friend for raising the matter. It is especially appropriate given the events in Northern Ireland at present.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have now come to the end of the time allotted for questions.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document Nos. COM(98)300, the Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB) of the European Communities for 1999, and SEC(98)800, the Commission's Overview of the Preliminary Draft Budget; and supports the Government's efforts to maintain budget discipline in the Community.—[<i>Mrs. Liddell.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>11.41 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful exchange of questions and answers. I thank the Economic Secretary and her officials for their efforts in ensuring that members of the Committee had all the relevant documents in good time for the debate. That was not always the case during the previous Parliament when I was also a member of European Standing Committee B; nor has it always been the case during this Parliament. The sheer volume of documents always makes it difficult to scrutinise them, but if they arrive late, scrutiny is almost impossible.<br><br>
I welcome the fact that we are continuing the practice, established by the previous Government, of holding the debate on the preliminary draft budget before the first Budget Council. That is essential if the House of Commons is to have a proper opportunity to influence, and comment on, the Government's approach at the Council meeting. Will the Economic Secretary confirm that there will be a further debate, either in Committee or on the Floor of the House before the draft budget is considered at the Budget Council in November?<br><br>
However, I must reiterate my concern about the fact that the debate is taking place in Committee and not on the Floor of the House. Although it is perfectly true that the Select Committee on European Legislation originally recommended that this debate should take place in European Standing Committee B, that was before members of the Select Committee had been able to scrutinise all the documents relating to the debate and also the supplementary explanatory memorandum prepared by the Treasury. When they had done so, they recommended that a full debate should take place on the Floor of the House. It is highly misleading to suggest that the only way that such a debate could occur would be for the Government not to hold Friday's debate on the Landmines Bill.<br><br>
There are two Adjournment debates on Thursday, and although both are on important subjects, they do not have the same degree of urgency as the matters before the Committee. Furthermore, we could debate these matters after 10 o'clock at night, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) pointed out. That would enable us to discuss them before the Economic Secretary attends the Council meeting on 17 July.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that all hon. Members have the opportunity to attend the Committee and debate the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0437">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
issues, although they cannot vote? Moreover, when the motion goes back to the Floor of the House, it will be possible for the Opposition to have a division on it, even though there will not be a debate. All hon. Members will therefore be able to debate the matter in Committee and to vote on it in the Chamber. No one will be left out of the process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is fine, but hon. Members have other commitments in the mornings. The Committee does not offer us an opportunity for a full six-and-a-half-hour debate. Indeed, the Committee is somewhat obscure; for example, members of the press are barely aware of its existence. I have seen its proceedings reported on only one occasion, to which I shall refer again. Debate in the Committee is not a substitute for a full debate on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear the strong concerns of Opposition Members, who have expressed their desire to vote on the issue. Why have they not therefore tabled an amendment to the motion before us today?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not prevent us from having a vote on it. I am not necessarily saying that we will wish to divide the Committee, but it is not a substitute for proper scrutiny in the Chamber to push this matter into a Committee for a time-limited period when many hon. Members have previous commitments and are unable to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend is saying is very important. This is not a question of people being nodded through on a vote, but a question of whether they have an opportunity to participate in a debate. They might not normally have any particular interest in speaking about the more esoteric sides of the European debate, but they are concerned about the way in which the single currency, enlargement and a whole range of other matters impinge on the manner in which we conduct our business in this House and the sovereignty of the British people. There are fundamental questions. The Modernisation Committee recognises that. Rather than read it all out now, I recommend that the members of the Committee who are huffing and puffing should read what the Modernisation Committee, which has been chaired by the Lord President of the Council—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This intervention is becoming a speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I simply ask whether my hon. Friend agrees that it would be a good idea if members of the Committee read the relevant passages from the Modernisation Committee report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree, and I took note of that point when my hon. Friend raised it as a point of order on the Floor of the House last night. It is important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman ask the hon. Member for Stone to read the part of the Modernisation Committee report which says that it believes that the scrutiny process of European
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
legislation in Standing Committees is working very well at present? It merely recommends some refinements; it does not object to the overall process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not for the first time, I find myself in disagreement with the Modernisation Committee. In my view the procedure for the scrutiny of European legislation is inadequate. However, at least we have a Select Committee that has been specifically established to reach a view on the importance of European documents and to make recommendations about where those documents should be debated. For the Government then to ignore its recommendations, as has happened today, makes a mockery of the entire procedure. It is not the first time that this has happened. It happened in the previous Parliament under my own Government. There was one occasion when the Government did not accept the unanimous view of the Select Committee that a matter should be debated on the Floor of the House rather than in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point. Were his Government not reluctant to have the debate on the Floor of the House because there were too many splits and they did not dare take the risk?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whatever the reason, I disagreed with them on that occasion. I should like to remind hon. Members that on that specific occasion the Opposition spokesman attacked the Government for using a "backstairs Committee" to make decisions on fundamental issues. He moved a motion to allow a debate on the Floor of the House. On that occasion I was not on the Front Bench and I did not support the Government. Indeed, I voted against them, and as a result the Government lost the motion. I hope that one or two Labour Members might follow the same course today—but I am not holding my breath.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is so concerned to have sufficient time to debate the budget, why is he taking so much of our time to debate where it should be debated?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the reason why we have spent some considerable time on this matter is because of the number of interventions, many from Labour Members. I always try to give way if I can, as that is the tradition of this House. But I agree with the hon. Gentleman. We should now move on to discuss the topic under consideration.<br><br>
I should like to return to the first issue which I raised in my question to the Economic Secretary, the level of UK contributions to the budget. As I pointed out, the explanatory memorandum talks about the fact that our gross contribution is stable and that our contribution after the abatement is set to fall. However, the departmental report shows a substantial increase in our net contribution between 1997–98 and 1998–99. Of course, I understand that matters are complicated by the fact that one set of documents relates to financial years and another set relates to calendar years, and that further complications are created by exchange rate fluctuations. However, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0438">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
Economic Secretary's answer did not make it clear whether our net contribution in sterling terms will rise from £2,305 million in 1997–98 to £3,025 million in 1998–99. That is an increase of 31.2 per cent. How does that figure square with the figures given in the Red Book, is it correct and will it appear in the plans that the Chancellor of the Exchequer intends to publish next week?<br><br>
On the overall budget, it is undeniable that expenditure is set to increase dramatically once again. The explanatory memorandum states that commitment appropriations and the preliminary draft budget will increase by 6.47 per cent. and that payment appropriations will rise by 3.38 per cent. The Economic Secretary has explained the problem relating to structural operations, but she also suggested that she considers that those percentage increases are still too large. They are certainly above the percentages quoted in the document when one leaves the effet of the increase in structural operations to one side.<br><br>
At the Budget Council, where will the Economic Secretary argue for reductions to be made? As she said earlier, the budget has not yet gone to the European Parliament and there is no doubt that it will try to increase the budget in the areas for which it has responsibility. Therefore, we can expect the final sums to be even greater than those before us today. Will the hon. Lady assure the Committee that greater increases will not appear in the actual draft budget and that, in the Budget Council in November, she will oppose any attempt by the European Parliament to increase the budget to more than is currently proposed?<br><br>
The Economic Secretary made much of the fact that the headroom under the financial perspective and the own-resources ceiling has increased. However, it is worth noting that the gap between the financial perspective and the preliminary draft budget is principally accounted for by agriculture, the figures for which are still provisional. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stone pointed out, the Select Committee on European Legislation drew attention to the fact that the figures for agricultural expenditure depend greatly on the market position of major commodities and on exchange rates. Despite the Economic Secretary's answer to my hon. Friend's question, she has not told us what the consequences will be if those assumptions are incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may have noticed on page 59 of Preliminary Draft General Budget the reference in annex 2 to the estimate of BSE-related budget costs for the beef sector. It will not have escaped his attention that BSE is today at the top of the political agenda because the National Audit Office has issued the most stringent criticisms of the manner in which arrangements for BSE were made.<br><br>
BSE was of great concern to the previous Government, and it remains a concern to the people of this country and to the Labour Government. Does my hon. Friend not agree that the costs set out in annex 2 are relevant and that the Economic Secretary is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
responsible for dealing with the matter properly? Does he also agee that the figures demonstrate the need for a proper and wide-ranging debate on that subject?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I must admit that I did not see that item of expenditure in the budget. However, he has raised an important point that I hope the Economic Secretary will address in her reply.<br><br>
I wish to concentrate on one or two items of expenditure. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood rightly drew attention to the proposed amount in the budget that will be spent on subsidising tobacco. As he said, next year the total will again rise, to reach a figure of 1 billion euros.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary said earlier that the tobacco reforms were not all that Britain would have liked to achieved. I therefore cannot understand how the hon. Lady can justify the increase in expenditure, given the Government's claimed commitment to reduce smoking. How can the Council of Ministers agree a ban on tobacco advertising, and then approve the expenditure of 1 billion euros on subsidising not only tobacco, but the most carcinogenic variety of tobacco? Will the Economic Secretary oppose this item of expenditure in the Budget Council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, as ever, makes a most perceptive point. This is an ethical matter. The Government are supposed to have an ethical foreign policy. Does it not stick in the craw that British taxpayers should subsidise morbidity? Is not the appropriate response, as I put to the Economic Secretary last year, for the United Kingdom to withhold part of its contribution to the common agricultural policy? The Economic Secretary said that that would be against the treaty, but it least it would be an honourable action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. The European Community's approach to this matter has always been completely hypocritical and it is high time that it came to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How on earth does the hon. Gentleman expect to persuade the Economic Secretary of that point, when he cannot persuade his Conservative colleagues in the European Parliament of it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of the vote by Conservative Members in the European Parliament. I would not have agreed with them—perhaps not for the first time.<br><br>
I turn to one or two other areas of expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, Mr. O'Hara.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to allow other hon. Members to take part in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman agreed with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood in calling for the Government to break the treaty by witholding part of its contribution. Will he confirm that he believes that Britain should break its treaty obligations?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0439">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I did not say that. I said that I hoped that the Economic Secretary would oppose this item of expenditure in the Budget Council next week. I look forward to her reply with interest.<br><br>
Other lines of expenditure are less substantial but are equally wasteful, unnecessary and—in many cases—utterly ridiculous. It appears that 250,000 euros are due to be spent on the Journalists in Europe Association and that 100,000 euros will be spent on the international secretariat of the Union of European Federalists. Restaurants and canteens will receive more than 1 million euros. However, the appropriation for combating fraud in the textile sector has been cut by 500,000 euros to 495,000.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) asked what estimate has been made of the level of fraud, as opposed to so-called irregularities. Earlier this year the National Audit Office estimated that every year fraud amounts to 4.5 billion ecu. That is about 5 per cent. of the total budget.<br><br>
Last November, the Economic Secretary said that the Government would use its presidency of the European Union to promote an active agenda to tackle fraud and waste. The Economic Secretary has said that fighting fraud would be the key priority of our presidency, and she repeated that this morning. Yet the result of our presidency's making this a key objective is a cut of more than 25 per cent. in the total expenditure on preventing fraud.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary attempted to justify that cut by saying that it does not imply a reduction in the effectiveness of our anti-fraud effort. She pointed out that the main responsibility lies with member states, which I accept. But that does not justify cutting the sum devoted to this purpose in the European budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For information, would my hon. Friend care to note that page 55 of the preliminary draft budget, which I may not have fully understood, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The expenditure estimates for monitoring and preventing such activities are reduced considerably compared with the appropriations for 1998"—</p></blockquote>
giving a figure of—37.8 per cent. for this year. That seems a significant amount—perhaps more than my hon. Friend thought.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend, who may not be aware that in his absence a Labour member of the Committee accused him of not being interested in the detail of these matters. Both his interventions have shown that that is not so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not another important point the fact that this reduction has occurred because monitoring satellites are in orbit doing their job taking photographs of the non-existent olive groves and so on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend.<br><br>
The Economy Secretary attempted to justify the cut and talked about a number of programmes coming to an end. She states in her explanatory memorandum that there is perhaps no longer a legal base for the continuation of expenditure in this area. I have to say that that has not stopped the Commission proposing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
expenditure in other areas with no legal base. I repeat: what kind of message does a cut of this size send? How can the hon. Lady possibly reconcile her claim that fighting fraud would be a key priority of our presidency with a cut of 25 per cent?<br><br>
Yet that is typical of the record of our presidency of the EU. The EU stands on the threshold of enormous change. Enlargement will happen and it is important that it does. Yet achieving it will require fundamental reform, including budgetary reform. In December, the Prime Minister said that under the UK presidency we would press for the beginning of the reform of the common agricultural policy and of the structural funds necessary to make enlargement a success. The Foreign Secretary said that the following month we would take forward proposals for agricultural reform under Agenda 2000. Six months later, virtually nothing has been achieved: there has still not even been a proper assessment of the costs of enlargement, let alone of how to meet them. At ECOFIN in June, all that could be said in the conclusions was that the Council would continue to consider the important economic and budgetary issues arising from all parts of Agenda 2000. In his report on the Council, the Chancellor of the Exchequer merely said that the Council had agreed on the fundamental importance of Agenda 2000 to the future economic and financial development of the EU. It is perhaps hardly surprising that the objectives of the new Austrian presidency states that substantial progress in these negotiations has to be achieved.<br><br>
The truth is that the United Kingdom presidency represented a golden opportunity that was thrown away. There has been no significant progress on enlargement or on the budgetary reforms necessary to make it happen. It is no wonder that the <i>Financial Times</i> said that
<br><blockquote><p>"failure to inject momentum into reforms"</p></blockquote>
was the "most dispiriting aspect" of the Cardiff summit. Following the summit, all that could be said was that negotiations on the Agenda 2000 proposals had begun.<br><br>
The result is that decisions of fundamental importance for this country will now have to be taken under another country's presidency. Already, we hear that Germany and the Netherlands are pressing for a reduction in their net contributions and that, despite what the Economic Secretary said earlier, there are calls for the United Kingdom's abatement to be reviewed. Indeed, I understand that part of Agenda 2000 is the Commission's suggestion that the United Kingdom correction mechanism be reviewed as soon as the first of the east European countries accede. We are grateful for what the hon. Lady has said about the Government's attitude to the rebate mechanism. However, I must ask the Economic Secretary how the Government will respond to Chancellor Kohl when he calls for a similar mechanism to benefit Germany? Will the hon. Lady, in the light of what is clearly stated in Agenda 2000, once again make it clear that the United Kingdom will accept no change to the abatement formula negotiated by Margaret Thatcher at Fontainebleau?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0440">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
What is the Government's attitude to proposals to increase the own-resources ceiling? Will the hon. Lady oppose any suggestions of introducing a fifth resource? If EMU goes ahead on time there will, according to many economists' predictions, need to be substantial transfer payments between member states, to deal with differing economic conditions. A study published by the Commission, and produced under the chairmanship of Sir Donald MacDougall, estimated that the budget will, at a minimum, need to increase to 5 per cent. to 7 per cent, of Community GDP. Will the Economic Secretary confirm that such a massive increase is unacceptable and make it clear that if such transfers are required as a consequence of economic and monetary union, we will not be required to contribute to them if we have not joined?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is raising a topical point that worries many people, not least those in the City of London. Will he press the Economic Secretary for an assurance that the Government will never accept a withholding tax on the savings of EU nationals in another EU jurisdiction? So many are kept in the City of London; if they were to become, through a withholding tax assigned to Brussels, the fifth element of EU financing, the British people could not tolerate it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That matter is of enormous concern in the City and has already been brought to my attention by practitioners there. I hope that the Economic Secretary will deal with it.<br><br>
All the matters that I have raised are vital to this country, yet none has been tackled by the Government—even in the six months of their presidency. Instead, we have been presented with a preliminary draft budget that perpetuates the status quo. Overall expenditure continues to rise in almost every area, but in the one in which more resources are badly needed—the fight against fraud—a cut of 25 per cent. is being made. The budget is a testament to the Government's failure.</span></p>
<p>12.8 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a short contribution, because it is important for as many hon. Members as possible to speak in the debate.<br><br>
Arguments can be made, and precedents found, both for and against the view that the Opposition have taken this morning about where our debate should be taking place. However, it is crucial that the Select Committee on European Legislation should speak with one voice, and maintain a consistent stance. It is to be hoped that that will enable the matter to be negotiated with the Government and sorted out once and for all. It does not help in the scrutiny of the European budget if we have arcane debates at the beginning of each relevant sitting.<br><br>
I welcome the enhanced method of scrutiny undertaken in this year's budget, with the opening up of the budget process and the Financial Secretary being prepared to take part in a seminar with members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
of the Select Committee on European Legislation. I suggest that in future that process should be widened to include members of the Standing Committee too. It emerges clearly in all our deliberations on the issue that, compared to our national budget, the European budget is very complicated and technical. It is important that as many hon. Members as possible should be aware of the issues.<br><br>
I also ask for a sense of proportion to be mantained while we debate the issues that we are considering. The European budget is important—and it is undoubtedly important to scrutinise it—but it represents about 1 per cent. of Britain's annual public expenditure. Certainly, no other 1 per cent. of public expenditure gives rise to the desire for such detailed scrutiny as the Opposition have proposed this morning.<br><br>
As for Britain's net contribution, by the end of the century ours will be overtaken by those of France, Holland, Sweden and Austria, though, as has been pointed out by the Financial Secretary, Britain's contribution needs to be attended to further. Our relative poverty in terms of GDP is lower down the scale than our contribution justifies. That is an issue to which we must return.<br><br>
There have been double standards in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just been mulling over the hon. Gentleman's remark, and I wonder whether he wants to correct himself. I think that he meant 1 per cent. of GNP, and hence approximately 2 per cent. of our budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall research the figures again, but my analysis is that it amounts to 1 per cent. of our annual public expenditure. Whether it is 1 or 2 per cent., it is still a relatively small sum. It is right to scrutinise the figures, but I sometimes feel that the degree of ferocity from the Opposition in their determination to scrutinise these issues is out of proportion to the amount of finance that we are talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman calculates the figures, he will see that I am right, roughly speaking. Does he agree that if the speed of increase that we have witnessed in the past 20 years were to persist, the figure would rise to about 50 per cent. of our budget 20 years from now? Therefore, it is especially important to scrutinise it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the sort of extrapolation that is undertaken simply to cloud and mislead. There is no evidence that this Government will allow European expenditure as a proportion of our budget to rise to those levels. The Financial Secretary has already made it clear that we are committed to the 1.27 per cent. GNP ceiling. If we remain within that figure, the sort of extrapolation being suggested by the hon. Member for West Dorset will not happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make some progress and then give way.<br><br>

There have been some misleading contributions about responsibility for this year's financial settlement. It has already been pointed out that the vast bulk of decisons were taken in Edinburgh in 1992. Since then, in the area of structural funds, there has been significant carry over from year to year, which, in itself, is an issue of concern. If there is carry over to generate funds for a particular purpose, that is justified, but if it is simply bad management of the budget, it needs to be addressed. That is certainly what happened under the previous Government.<br><br>
There have been many references to the apparent stitch-up that took place in Edinburgh in 1992. I was not a Member at that time, but if there was a stitch-up, it was between Chancellor Kohl and the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major). The hon. Member for Stone is nodding in agreement. The previous Government are responsible for the budget that we are debating today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not get me to revise any of the views that I expressed at that time, and I reinforce them today, but that is not the point of my intervention.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has made a useful point in drawing attention to the need for perspective in terms of the amount of money involved. Does he agree that lying at the heart of many of our European debates is the problem that it is not simply a question of money but the reallocation of functions and powers and the manner in which there is an enlargement in the competence of the European Union? We do not necessarily need to spend money if there is an accumulation of power to the centre.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must intervene and rule out of order the hon. Gentleman's question, which goes beyond the considerable bounds of legitimate debate on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I shall continue with my remarks.<br><br>
I return to the issue of tobacco subsidy, which is pertinent and within the remit of the European budget. We are concerned about vast amounts of public money, from wherever it is derived, being used to substitute tobacco production within the European Union at the same time as we are pushing through a ban on tobacco advertising because of the detrimental effect of tobacco on people's health. When the issue was debated in the European Parliament, Conservative Members of Parliament, virtually to a person, voted against taking action. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood says that they are not real Conservatives. It is not political hyperbole to say that that demonstrates the fundamental splits that still exist within the Conservative party on Europe. They will remain light years away from government while they function in that fashion.<br><br>
It is difficult to compare year-on-year expenditure because of the sterling and ecu—and now the euro—appropriations. The fact that comparisons are now made in sterling makes it somewhat easier, although,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
if Britain joins the single currency, it will provide a degree of transparency, which will allow realistic comparisons to be made.<br><br>
I shall move on to the abatement. As a member of the Select Committee on European Legislation, I have met politicians from Germany and Holland who are exercised about the matter, and we may have to return to the question in future. I was pleased to hear my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary restate our commitment to the present payment procedures. Apart from anything else, to move away from them would further undermine the contribution that Britain makes in proportion to its relative wealth in the European Union.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend will also make the point strongly at the Council of Finance Ministers that to move away from the present abatement procedure—I say this as someone who is committed to Britain's membership of the EU—would provide manna from heaven to the Tory Euro-sceptics, who would take it as another argument against our membership of the EU. It is crucial that we stick to our guns on that question.<br><br>
Opposition Members have made much of tackling fraud. However, the Amsterdam treaty, which allowed qualified majority voting the better to tackle fraud, was opposed by them. How would they improve the mechanism for dealing with fraud without such a treaty?<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Twickenham that it is important that we should distinguish between genuine fraud and the problems caused by the fact that, because many procedures are extraordinarily complicated, form filling is not appropriate; yet that is identified under the same terminology. It is important that, when talking about fraud, we establish whether it is real.<br><br>
Overall, it is a sensible and prudent budget. I wish the Economic Secretary well at the Council of Ministers.</span></p>
<p>12.18 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I draw the Economic Secretary's attention to the remarks that she made to the Committee on 10 December 1997. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"A point that I made in the budget negotiations concerned the Union's tendency sometimes to set expected expenditure levels that are way out of kilter with what could be spend in the relevant period. It is important, for sound financial management, that budgets should not be overestimates."—[<i>Official Report, European Standing Committee B,</i> 10 December 1997; c. 7.]</p></blockquote>
During question time this morning, I asked the Economic Secretary to reflect on the gap between commitments and payments—the subject to which the hon. Lady was referring on 10 December. She illuminatingly came back with an answer to a different question, on the growth of payments and commitments. As illustrated by an exchange during the previous speech, that is another interesting question.<br><br>
The compound annual nominal growth rate in the budget is a matter of concern to us, but I had asked the Economic Secretary about the gap between payments and commitments. If we inspect the preliminary draft budget, we will see that the gap between commitments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0442">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
and payments—the hon. Lady did not refer to the gap in her opening remarks—is about 10 billion ecu. In the 1998 budget it was finally set at about 8 billion ecu, so it has grown substantially.<br><br>
The draft budget is interesting on the subject. At page 24, the general introduction to the budget states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The relatively high level of under-implementation of Community initiatives in past years, varying from one initiative to another, calls for major reprogramming."</p></blockquote>
We must ask ourselves what is going on. We must disentangle the matter. On 10 December 1977, the Economic Secretary drew our attention to the process whereby ever higher commitments are allowed and ever greater gaps arise between those and payments. More comments are made about such matters by the authors of succeeding documents, but absolutely nothing is being done to contain the problem.<br><br>
On 10 December, the hon. Lady was in an ideal position to attack the problem. I do not want to make a partisan speech as I accept entirely that Governments of both colours for many years in this country and elsewhere in Europe have been responsible for allowing such a catastrophic state of affairs to continue. However, the hon. Lady had the opportunity to do something about the matter when the UK had the presidency. She has not said whether she tried to do something about the problem. If she did try, she certainly failed. If the Committee is to scrutinise the budget seriously, it must take such issues in hand and consider the character of the budget. The Economic Secretary owes it to the Committee to explain what she tried to do and why she failed. There may be good reasons for her failure. I accept that it is difficult even for the presidency to exert influence over such matters, but we must know the reason for her failure, so that the House as a whole and future Governments can learn lessons to ensure that it is not repeated.<br><br>
I am not worried simply that there is a gap between commitments and payments, but that a certain attitude underlies that gap. If the commitments exceed the payments, if the financial perspective exceeds the budget or if the own-resources ceiling exceeds what is garnered in the resources, that constitutes a problem, but it is the reverse of what is considered to be the problem. It is believed that there is a need for major reprogramming—in other words, that the EU has gone wrong because it needs desperately to scramble around to find another way to spend the money that it has not got around to spending.<br><br>
That such a text should appear in the preliminary draft budget suggests that that attitude was not changed by the previous presidency. That is no way to construct such a budget. I have my own views about the current Chancellor of the Exchequer, which might be shared by my hon. Friends, but at least I can say with confidence that the right hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary do not wander round Whitehall towards the end of the financial year inciting Departments to spend up to the limits that they have been allocated.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is going into fantasy land. One of the key matters that the present Government have changed is the bizarre practice of year-end equalisation. I speak as a former member of the Scottish Prisons Board and I know why all prisons are painted the same colour. At the end of the financial year, money had to be spent or it could not be budgeted for the following year, so we ended up buying pot after pot of green paint. The Government are moving away from the system of annualisation to a more coherent and rational way of organising our accounts, so that we do not repeat the lunacies that were foisted on us by the ineffectiveness of Conservative Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for those remarks. I began the fight against annuality more than 10 years ago when I was a member of a policy unit. It was an inheritance of about 50 years that regimes of every colour had fostered. It was, indeed, lunacy, and I am delighted that annuality is being attacked.<br><br>
The fact remains, however, that, even under the annuality rules—stupid as they were—Chancellors of the Exchequer and Chief Secretaries persistently tried to find out where there were large gaps and remove them. They did not want to incite Departments to spend up when there was genuine underspending on a large scale. The problem is that that attitude has not yet pervaded the Commission. I am not making a partisan point, but it is up to politicians in various countries to ensure, on behalf of the taxpayers, that the budget is set so that it is controlled on a political and accountable basis and that it is not a device for allowing spending up to a limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend advise the Committee on whether, in such circumstances, it would be sensible to look to the European Parliament to act as a brake and to exercise its collective discipline, on behalf of the voters who elect its representatives—be they Conservative, European People's Party, or whatever? Can one have confidence in the record of the European Parliament? Has it exercised pressure in a downwards direction on the EU budget? My hunch is that it tends to exert pressure in an upwards direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows the answer to his question, which is why he asks it. He is right; the European Parliament has been part not of the solution but the problem.<br><br>
The problem is deep because it is an institutional one. It relates to what might be termed a conspiracy I do not mean that in a malign sense—between the various institutions of the EU to work out, one way and another, how the budget can continually increase without ever appearing to increase too much. The devices of headroom and of a gap between commitment and payment are, with all the rest of it, part of that mentality.<br><br>
The Minister told us on 10 December—I took her then, as I take her now, at face value—that she was determined to oppose that tendency, and said that the Government would try to do something about it. That is a noble ambition which, laying aside all party
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0443">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
politics and political interests, Opposition Members would support completely. As I said, the Minister needs to tell us what efforts she has made in that regard—and if she has made efforts, whether they failed and if so, why and how—between the emergence of the preliminary draft budget and the draft budget. If the problem is not solved it will continue to be a cancer at the heart of the European Union's operations and will continue to provoke such discussions as we are having.</span></p>
<p>12.28 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A point to start with is a sentence in my hon. Friend's explanatory memorandum of 18 May that hit me between the eyes. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The desire for rigour in the EC budget is shared by a majority of member States".</p></blockquote>
I should be interested to know whether any member states have expressed no desire for rigour in the budget and if so, which. I find the notion that any member state would not be in favour of such rigour extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but would he agree that a rational person would, if he were a major beneficiary of endless expenditure, favour the increase of that expenditure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and I could make some intelligent guesses about who might take such a position. One would shoot oneself in the foot by demanding rigour.<br><br>
On the second point about scrutiny, as a new Member I have been impressed by the level of our scrutiny of European matters—a subject in which I have a particular interest. We have a Select Committee, two Standing Committees and occasional debates on the Floor of the House that deal with European matters. Parliamentarians can scrutinise all manner of important European issues. I am sure that that helps to exercise our officials, Government Departments and Ministers to ensure that they present us with the facts and that all the issues are properly brought out. Over the past year, our level of scrutiny has been comparable to that of other member states; indeed, ours tends to be greater, even if it could be improved.<br><br>
The Opposition raised the issue of the value of the pound. It is substantially over-valued and that poses a problem for our economy. The TUC, among others, has urged the Government to consider measures that would reduce the exchange rate, especially in regard to the euro and the deutschmark. I know that the Treasury is concerned about that. The TUC suggests a reduction of perhaps 20 per cent.—even more than that may be necessary, because the rate may have been over-valued by as much as 25 per cent.—if a fair comparison were made.<br><br>
The draft budget is relatively—I emphasise the term—uncontroversial. It has not changed much from the previous year and we cannot therefore get too
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
excited about it. The problems do not vary from year to year but are fundamental problems which we have addressed at almost every meeting.<br><br>
There is the inequity of contributions and the fact that richer member states are net recipients while poorer member states are net contributors to the budget. That clearly is still a serious problem and leads to quite substantial differences. Even with the rebate the gap is about £1 billion in Britain's case, a sum that would go nicely into regional assistance, the health service or whatever. Even if we were levelled up so that we contributed no more than we received, it would be beneficial, appropriate and fair.<br><br>
I move on to agriculture and the common agricultural policy, which time and again causes us long debates. It must be fundamentally reformed. Enlargement will force us to bite on that bullet. We are taking into the European Union countries which have large agricultural sectors and much lower costs than other member states. It is clear the kind of subsidies provided under the CAP would break the budget. Change has to take place. I am pleased that our Government are committed to fundamental reform. We have not come to a conclusion on that; we are waiting to see what the reforms might be but we will be forced to address the issue soon.<br><br>
I have my own suggestion, which is not Government policy or my party's policy. We ought at least to have on the table the possibility of reverting to a system of national economic subsidies and national regulation of agricultural sectors. Every country's agricultural sector is different. Ours is very different from others. One of the reasons why we have had problems with the CAP is because our agricultural sector is small and highly efficient compared with many others. The matter should at least be on the table for discussion. I ask the Government to have that as one option.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend join me in welcoming the fact that the common agricultural policy budget has not increased at all this year, which is the first step towards reduction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. The pressure from British Governments and others over the years has got the CAP at least partially under control. For a long time, with wine lakes and butter mountains and all of that, it was nonsense. It is more disciplined than it was. [<i>Interruption.</i>] From wherever they are observed, from satellites or wherever, the butter mountains are smaller. The CAP is much more under control and it is a credit to Britain that we have constantly talked about the CAP to make sure that it is more disciplined.<br><br>
The whole system needs to be examined, however, and fundamentally reformed. I would like there to be the possibility of a debate about going back to the system of deficit financing. Why not? We can debate it. It may turn out to be neither practicable nor desirable but at least we should discuss it. For many years that system worked in Britain before we joined the CAP. It might even work in other countries.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0444">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
We have other problems in relation to structural funds. We have had rather worrying rumours this year that Germany and other countries are not happy with structural fund expenditures. That may cause a problem when enlargement takes place. I was pleased that the President of the Board of Trade was so strong in her defence of structural fund spending in Britain and said that that was a no-go area for the UK. If we start to lose out on that front even more than we do now we could have an even larger deficit in our balance of budget payments with the EU. The fact that our Government are standing up for Britain on these issues is important.<br><br>
There is an undercurrent that some of the important aspects of the budget that protect Britain are being questioned. We have had some reassurance from my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and I am pleased about that. However, we will shortly have to face fundamental reform of the budget. When that is done, I hope that arrangements can be put in place by agreement throughout the European Union that will ensure that countries contribute according to their ability and receive according to their need. That will end the nonsense of rich countries receiving more than they contribute and poorer countries contributing more than they receive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made some extremely important points, not least the one relating to fundamental reform which implies a fundamental assessment. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has had the chance to look at page 129 of volume 1 of the Preliminary Draft General Budget. It sets out a list of buildings owned by the European Union and, if members of the Committee study it, they will see that the "grand total" of their value—lists of them are set out—appears to be 1,056,993,960 ecu. That looks to me as though it is much more than 1·5 trillion ecu. Should not that incredible state of affairs be a subject for fundamental reform?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not studied that part of the report in detail, but I was aware that it referred to buildings. I emphasise that we should not look at the detail if that takes our eye off the ball game, which is the overall level of expenditure and the systems that are in place. We could consider the EU's assets and detailed spending, but it worries me that local authorities and colleagues in our constituencies get excited about receiving contributions from European budgets when they do not appreciate that we are net contributors. Even if we came back into balance, they might receive rather more if we considered the overall picture rather than the detail. There are major issues that the Government and all of us must consider.</span></p>
<p>12.38 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable <span class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I endorse the comments made by the hon. Member for Harlow about putting the issue into context. We are dealing with just 1 or 2 per cent. of British public expenditure, and, as the Treasury memorandum makes clear, only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
10 per cent. of the European budget is accounted for by the budget process. The other 90 per cent. is non-discretionary: it is accounted for by decisions on agricultural and structural matters made elsewhere. Therefore, we are dealing with a small element of the budget process. That point is relevant when we discuss the way in which the scrutiny process operates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right: much of the budget is determined elsewhere. Does he agree, however, that it is a deficiency in a budgetary process if Ministers from various countries find that they have relatively little discretion over the budget? Will it help the United Kingdom economy if the Chancellor of the Exchequer finds that there is little that he can do to adjust the budget?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Cable</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is clearly a deficiency in the budgetary process even though the other 90 per cent. is accountable to the European Parliament. There is that level of accountability.<br><br>
I wish to make two substantive points that follow from my questions to the Economic Secretary. The first relates to the problem of fraud, about which she gave me a full and helpful answer. Therefore, I shall not pursue the point about the importance of distinguishing between true fraud and bureaucratic difficulties that I made earlier. That point was fully taken on board.<br><br>
A more subtle point is important. The documentation makes it clear that most fraud is not accounted for not by the theft of public money but by tax evasion as a result of smuggling and—to use a posher word—arbitrage. A large amount of value added tax and excise duty is not paid as a result of business people taking advantage of big differences in duty rates and levies. We must ask to what extent it is in the British public interest to pursue such issues aggressively. Clearly, in some instances, there is an important principle: in this country, we have relatively high rates of cigarette duty, for good public interest reasons. We are not merely concerned about Treasury revenue; we are trying to discourage smoking. There should be tough enforcement of measures against those who are trying to undermine our public interest policies on cigarettes. We need strong anti-fraud measures.<br><br>
However, there are several other instances in which it would not be in our interest to pursue so-called fraud aggressively. Let us consider some items in the agriculture budget: in many cases, prices are fixed at ludicrous levels—three or four times greater that world prices—and businesses are selling products at prices that are closer to world prices to benefit British consumers. Of course, they are evading the levies and are acting illegally, but it could be argued that they are acting in the public interest by saving us money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is getting into deep water. I am sure that he realises that there is a distinction between avoidance and evasion. He seems to be suggesting that we should not be too fussy about that distinction. Surely, the problem and the mischief is that there is a huge amount of fraud.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0445">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
I have visited the Court of Auditors, as a member of the Select Committee on European Legislation. When members of the court speak privately, they point out that the figures for fraud set out in their report are much lower than they believe the real amount to be. That would include the irregularities that I suspect the hon. Member for Twickenham wants to cover up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Cable</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentlman is anticipating my conclusion. It is easy to work up a tremendous emotional lather about fraud. Of course, real fraud must be dealt with. However, many problems arise because of foolish policies and they should be addressed. I mentioned the big difference between world and European prices for some agricultural items.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) referred to textiles, which was a good example. The reason that so-called fraud exists in that industry is because of the utterly absurd textile trade regime in Europe, where there is a system of regulation that rivals the old Gosplan system in the Soviet Union in its byzantine complexity. There are national quotas and quotas for about 100 different products, all with many subdivisions. There is immense scope for abuse of that system.<br><br>
I do not encourage people to abuse the system, but it should be liberalised or abolished. We should be addressing the policy problems, rather than focusing exclusively on fraud and evasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is fascinating the Committee. Is he suggesting that the Liberal Democrat party has reverted to the old-style, genuine liberalism of free trade? Are Liberal Democrats moving away from the "Europhiliac" period that I had imagined they were still in?<br><br>
How can he justify the gloss that he puts on the practice of fraud in the European Union? Year on year, the Court of Auditors cannot account for about 10 per cent. of the budget. That is a horrific indictment for any organisation, especially a public body such as the European Union which administers public funds. It cannot be deliberately glossed over.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Cable</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I and my party have always strongly favoured a liberal approach to trade. The textiles regime—to which I am opposed—is a scar on the face of Europe. I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins). He suggested that the subsidiarity principle should be applied to agriculture and that there should be national decision making to support agriculture. That would be a sensible reform.<br><br>
My support for the European Union is not dogmatic. I do not agree with everything that has a European label. That would be foolish.<br><br>
I do not want to gloss over fraud. There is serious fraud and theft of public money and we must concentrate on that. However, will the Economic Secretary ensure that as well as clarifying the difference between real fraud and bureaucratic regulation abuse, we also gain a clear picture of the extent to which fraud
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
is generated unnecessarily by over-regulation of certain European markets, such as textiles and agriculture?<br><br>
Let me draw an analogy with a household deciding to put the family jewellery in front of an open window and then going out; on returning, the household bitterly complains about burglary. The obvious answer is to put the jewellery away and lock it up before going out. In the context of fraud, my argument is that prevention is better than policing.<br><br>
My second point relates to the UK contribution. Several Labour Members, and particularly the hon. Member for Luton, North, made useful points about the controversy over whether the British are paying their fair share. The issue has reverberated over the past 18 years, particularly when Mrs. Thatcher was Prime Minister. Deciding Britain's level of wealth is a genuine issue and some Labour Members said that we are effectively a poor country. We may well be, but what does that mean?<br><br>
The problem is created because we do not have a common or single currency. If the British pound appreciates relative to the rest of the world by 20 per cent., in terms of a common currency—whether the euro or the dollar—we will be 20 per cent. better off, though our living standards will not have changed one iota. We therefore need some basis for establishing our relative standard of living in relation to our European partners.<br><br>
The Treasury memorandum may provide some hints about the Government's approach to the problem: the Government seem unable to debate it explicitly. The Minister thought that I was getting very technical but I am raising a fundamental political problem. How can we sensibly judge our proper share of the contribution—18 per cent., 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. in gross terms? What rate is appropriate given our present standard of living?<br><br>
The Treasury seems to have a rule of thumb or benchmark, which is that our proper share should be about 15 per cent. If my mental arithmetic is correct, the Government also believe that an appropriate exchange rate for judging our relative living standards is around DM2.50. I seek clarification because it is so important to have a handle on the issue. We must have a proper basis for calculating our contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development standardises from year to year to take account of fluctuating exchange rates. We could debate the matter but it is fairly well established that we have slipped down the rankings in the longer term and that we now contribute disproportionately to the budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Cable</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is a fair summary of the debate. I wanted to be clear that that was what the Treasury was saying in implying that our contribution is about 3 per cent. greater than it should be, but that may be an over-simplification of a complicated argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rather than the gloomy picture that some seem to be painting, many of us are positive about Europe and do not view it in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0446">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
terms of a pound in and a pound out. That is a naive and simplistic way of looking at the budget. We are contributing to a European budget which is part of developing a broader, wider vision of the Europe of the future. This "pound in, pound out" approach ignores all the benefits of our membership of the European Union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Cable</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely endorse that ebullient approach. I am as sympathetic as anyone in the Committee to adopting a positive approach towards the European Union. I certainly do not agree with the "pound in, pound out" approach. However, I would like to leave the Minister with my question about assessing our fair share to the European budget.</span></p>
<p>12.49 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This will have to be a brisk canter. I shall not be able to take any interventions if I am to reply to all the points.<br><br>
I welcome the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) to his post on the Front Bench. It is the first scrutiny debate that he has undertaken in his new capacity. I especially thank him on behalf of my officials, who, of course, are not supposed to be seen in the Room. Last year, we had an unpleasant exchange about photocopying documents for the Committee. As hon. Members know, I do not stand over the photocopier, preparing documents for the Committee; the officials do that. Distressing things were said last year, and I greatly welcome the change of tone. The Committee entails much intensely technical work. I pay tribute to those who do that work, and I welcome the positive remarks of the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's remarks in general. He has shown the great value of getting away from posturing to tackle issues.<br><br>
We spent too much time this morning discussing whether the debate should be held in Committee or on the Floor of the House. The Select Committee recommended that the debate should take place in Committee. There are many opportunities to discuss such matters, but I believe that a scrutiny debate in Committee is useful. Perhaps it has something to do with the air conditioning in the Chamber, but more rhetorical flourishes are employed there. In Committee, we have an opportunity to deal with matters in detail.<br><br>
If I do not reply to some hon. Member's points in the brisk canter that I am about to undertake, I shall write to them. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked whether there would be further debates on the draft budget. That is up to the Select Committee on European Legislation. Last year, there were two debates; in previous years, one debate took place. I am willing to debate the matters that we have considered at any time because they are important. Such discussions can assist me in the negotiations that take place in the Budget Council.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford also asked about the level of contributions. The figures for 1997–98 and 1998–99 are calculated on two different bases. I shall describe the background to that. The figure for 1997–98 constitutes the amount for cash payments; the figure for 1998–99 covers trend payments. The Government will publish a revised figure as part of the comprehensive spending review—I shall not consider that in detail now.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford is right when he says that there is a difference in the two years. It is well known that there are wide fluctuations in the net contributions for a variety of reasons. They involve the timing of receipts and payments, and corrections to previous years' contributions.<br><br>
I shall speak about one of the major causes of the fluctuations. In 1997, a substantial recovery was made through a Community underspend in 1996. That significantly reduced the United Kingdom's GNP-based contribution by approximately £425 million. We expect to recover only £100 million for 1998 because the sequence of payments has been much more accurate.<br><br>
That relates to the point that the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) made. We agree on such matters. It is not sound financial management to include figures as a rough outline of potential expenditure, but it will take time to change procedures. The SEM 2000 initiative is aimed at sound and efficient financial management, and a logical way in which to conduct accounting processes.<br><br>
I shall deal briefly with the technical term, "the rule of thumb", and perhaps provide a more technical answer. I thought that the hon. Member for Twickenham had tried to make a more technical point. We are trying to create a benchmark that is based on our experience of the fluctuation in the exchange rate between the pound and the ecu. That will, as the hon. Member for West Dorset said, ease from 1 January 1999, when the single currency will be introduced in 11 countries.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the consequences of the Commission's assumptions about the common agricultural policy and about what would happen if they turn out to be wrong. If one looks at those assumptions retrospectively, they appear prudent, because the Commission knows what fluctuations are likely over a year. The most likely consequences are that there will be savings in the budget, but I shall press for more accurate figures. To make a point that links to my previous one, that is why I have agreed to a late letter of amendment in the autumn. Such a letter makes provision for the Commission to put forward a more accurate estimate, based on market fluctuations and real conditions, which gives a more accurate figure of what should be included in the budget. That is one step along the way of ensuring that we have coherent figures, rather than educated guesses, in the budget.<br><br>
On payments. I shall continue to argue for reductions that are more likely to reflect the outturn in the budget. As I said to the Member for West Dorset about the fluctuations that obscure the real picture, the budget has in previous years underspent. On

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
commitments, I shall seek to adjust them for the fifth framework programme, to the level agreed by the Council. I would also look for reductions across a wide range of budget lines because my judgment is that the Commission's proposals are excessive. I shall not go into too much detail on that because I do not wish to destroy my negotiating position whenever the budget discussions take place.<br><br>
The European Parliament has a huge amount of power in that area. The previous Government, who signed up to it, know more about that than we do. It is easy to carp and posture about the presidency, but it has been a business-like presidency, which has achieved real successes—one of which has been getting the European Parliament to agree that the budget should increase with the increase in member states' budgets. That is a logical position because it means that the increases will not be out of line with our own, internal budgetary rigour.<br><br>
Members of the Committee should believe me when I say that we will not allow the European Parliament to forget that commitment. However, as Opposition Members know better than we, the European Parliament has a considerable say in such matters; the Council does not have the final say. That is why cooperation between the Council and the Parliament, and inter-institutional agreements, are important—to ensure a proper balance of power and that discussions take place about the various aspects of the agreements that are being drawn up.<br><br>
On Agenda 2000, it is naive to think that substantial negotiations on such a wide-ranging framework can be achieved in the blink of an eye. It will take time to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
negotiate the issues. Several of our fellow member states have general elections coming up in the next few months—which are, naturally enough, occupying their attention, as happened here in the run-up to 1 May 1997. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North made the point about sterling; two-thirds of the increase in sterling took place before the general election. The Select Committee will have an opportunity to consider the matters soon; an explanatory memorandum will be produced in response to the Commission's announcements on Agenda 2000.<br><br>
I confirm that, importantly, we shall make no concessions whatever on abatement. Other countries have sought an ameliorating relationship in regard to their contributions. I would ask them to consider the CAP: reform of the CAP could considerably change the entire structure of net contributions.<br><br>
Even though I have cantered through them, I have not managed to get to the very end of my notes. None the less, we have had a full discussion. I shall write to hon. Members on points that I have not covered.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
