	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Agenda 2000: Structural and Cohesion Funds</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this scrutiny debate on the structural and cohesion fund elements of Agenda 2000. Before I go any further, it might help Committee members if I explain the scrutiny arrangements relating to the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agenda 2000 covers the medium-term future of the European Union in the years 2000 to 2006. One key element of that will be the prospect of EU enlargement. Another key element will be the future financing and expenditure of the EU and the question of reform to the two largest elements of that expenditure(the common agricultural policy and the structural and cohesion funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government submitted four explanatory memoranda on the document: one from the Foreign Office on enlargement issues; one from the Treasury on future financing; one from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on reform of the CAP; and one that I produced on structural and cohesion reform. The Select Committee on European Legislation recommended for debate the memoranda from the Treasury, from MAFF and from the Department of Trade and Industry. We are this morning examing the DTI memorandum. Tomorrow, the Treasury memorandum will be considered and European Standing Committee A will examine the MAFF memoradum. That will enable the House of Commons to consider each of the key elements of the propsals before they are discussed at the Luxembourg European Council on Friday and Saturday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between them, the structural and cohesion funds take up one third of the EU budget. They are the principal European financial instruments for promoting economic and social cohesion and for regional policy. The funds face major changes roughly every six or seven years, and the discussion is starting on changes to the funds for the period from 2000 onwards. The last major changes to the regulations governing the funds occurred in 1993 and came into effect in the programmes that started in 1994. There are currently 30 main programmes operating across the United Kingdom. Those programmes will continue until the end of 1999, by which time the regulations will need to be reviewed. The European Commission published its suggestions for the reform of the funds in its communication Agenda 2000 on 16th July. It is likely to produce detailed legislative proposals in the spring of next year. When it does, we
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
shall provide a further explanatory memorandum, and there will be a further opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU faces significant changes over the next decade, particularly if it is to enlarge to include new member states from central and eastern Europe. The CAP needs to be reformed, and the EU's structural policies need to adapt to the changed circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In approaching the question of reform of the structural and cohesion funds, the Government believe that the new arrangements need to be fair to all Member States(especially to the United Kingdom and its regions(that they need to be affordable and durable, and that they need to be simpler and more efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is the second largest net contributor to the EU's finances. We are net contributors to the cost of the funds. That means that we need to pay close attention both to the total cost of the funds and to our receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government strongly support EU enlargement. That will enhance security and stability of central and eastern Europe and boost the UK's trading opportunities with that rapidly growing market. It will also bring the EU wider political and economic benefits and meet the applicants' aspirations to fulfil their historic destiny. However, the accession of poorer countries will have significant implications for the finances of the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Commission recognises, the overall EU budget must be contained within its current share of gross domestic product. With enlargement, that will mean that the structural funds will have to stretch further and that all existing member states will have to accept a significantly lower level of receipts in the next century. The UK's net contribution will rise on enlargement(we accept that that is the necessary price of bringing countries into the EU. However, we cannot accept the UK's net contribution moving even further out of line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We set out our beliefs about what the fundamentals of reform should be in the explanatory memorandum. Those beliefs are as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The overall cost of the Structural and Cohesion Funds should be contained below 0.46 per cent. of EU GNP, both before and after enlargement.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Funds' effectiveness should be improved, and substantial administrative simplification is needed.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The reform of the Funds should be durable, and fair to acceding new Member States.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>All existing Member States should expect cuts in their receipts if costs are to be contained.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>While recognising that there will be a drop in receipts, the new regime should be fair to the UK in comparison with other Member States."</p></blockquote>
I will explain what we understand by fairness. The UK is the fourth or fifth poorest member state in the EU, in terms of GDP per capita, but, as we understand them, the Commission's proposals will not make us the fourth or fifth largest per capita recipient. Therefore, we are not convinced that the Commission's ideas for distributing the funds are fair, and we are discussing how to establish a fairer system with the Commission and with other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
We do not presently know how individual regions or localities will be affected by this reform, and we will not know until the Commission puts forward detailed proposals and they have been negotiated in the Council of Ministers and approved by the European Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the negotiations on the future of the funds, the Government will aim to protect the interests of the United Kingdom as a whole. We are still developing our detailed approach at this early stage, and we will take account of points raised in Committee today and those raised by others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. Members are reminded that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. All Members are likely to have ample opportunity to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why, in paragraph 10 of the explanatory memorandum, she says that countries will be eligible for the cohesion fund whether they join the third stage of EMU or not? On page 20 of the document, we are told that eligible countries will be the following:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Member States whose	<i>per capita</i>GNP is less than 90 per cent. and which take part in the third phase of EMU".</p></blockquote>
That discrepancy was identified by the Select Committee itself. Which of those formulae is correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see a discrepancy in that context. Some room exists for different interpretations(the hon. Gentleman will know that the Government interpreted the proposals in one way, while the Select Committee thought that countries that joined the first wave of EMU might still be eligible for the cohesion fund. We believe our interpretation to be correct, but we will seek clarification on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased and reassured by what my hon. Friend has just said about the implications of Britain's net contributions, subject to changes in the structural and cohesion funds. My hon. Friend says it is difficult to say how Britain will be affected in any detailed way at this stage. Will she assure us that studies will be undertaken to ascertain how we will be affected, both under different headings and in terms of our overall net contribution? Will she attempt to ensure that, whatever changes take place, Britain is treated equitably in comparison with other member states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for those remarks. I can give him an absolute assurance on his questions. We will probably not see the Commission's detailed proposals until the spring, but we are already emphasising to the Commission the broad underlying principles that we want for the funds. I was in Brussels last week, and I took the opportunity to reinforce the points that I have made to relevant Commissioners about the approach that the United Kingdom would take. I can give my hon. Friend the assurances that he seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government agree with page 13 of the document, where the Commission says that policies on pensions and health care systems should be co-ordinated across Europe and that a new regulatory framework for pension funds may be justified at European Union level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are matters for my colleagues at the Department of Health and the Department of Social Security. The hon. Gentleman will get a suitable and coherent answer if he addresses his question to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Point 7 of the Minister's explanatory memorandum of 19 September refers to geographical targeting of objective 2 funds. Will the Minister expand on that? Does it mean that high unemployment or deprivation in a particular area will not be the deciding factor in whether objective 2 funding is made available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to consider the situation in the round and to see what the overall effects will be. We are in the early stages of negotiation, and, as I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), we do not yet know what the final position will be. We want to consider several factors. We believe that gross domestic product has to be considered a more effective measure than unemployment in the existing economic situation. Unemployment tells us something about current economic cycles, but gives a picture that is not perhaps as rounded as it might be. Unemployment can help member states to target funds at regions or areas, but GDP is a better way of considering the complete picture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that per capita GDP is the only measure of regional performance? How does she square that with the regional competitiveness indicators published earlier this year by her Department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we are not saying that. Several factors must be considered. There is a difference between regions and member states. In considering member states, GDP is a better measure. In targeting support on a regional basis, unemployment is clearly important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission's document suggests criteria that should be applied to identify future objective 2 areas. Those criteria concentrate on unemployment and industrial change. Does the Minister consider that the Government should press for a further criterion of environmental degradation in particular areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, the Commission's proposals examine three new objective areas. Objective 2 covers industrial, urban, rural and fishing areas. We believe that environmental concerns could be included in the new objective 2 status. My hon. Friend is right to mention environmental considerations, which are extremely important in areas of industrial re-development. I am sure that his concerns can be catered for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred(if I may paraphrase her opening statement(to the United Kingdom accepting the costs of the accession of new members, but not being prepared to see an increase in the UK's net contribution. That is an acceptance of the idea of accession but "not in our back yard".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 30 of the explanatory memorandum, there is a reference to estimates of the consequences for individual member states or regions. Has the Commission prepared such estimates? If not, has the Department of Trade and Industry or the Treasury prepared any estimates of the likely impact of the document's proposals on the United Kingdom as a whole and on specific regions of the United Kingdom? If not, how can the Government go into the negotiations without having a baseline estimate of what the impact on the United Kingdom would be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall put the hon. Gentleman right. I understand that it is difficult when someone is making an opening statement to take it all in. The UK's net contribution, like those of many other countries, will rise on enlargement. We accept that that is a necessary price for bringing those countries into the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we cannot accept that the UK's net contribution should move even further out of line. We accept that there should be enlargement—like the previous Administration, we think that it is a good thing, not only for the Union, but for security in Europe as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are currently waiting for further details to be published by the Commission. We are now setting out before the Committee the basis on which we shall go into the negotiations. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman that we are attempting to press for more transparency, simplicity and openness, and for less bureaucracy in the administration of funds. We hope to do considerably better than the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which geographical units will be eligible for funding under objective 2? Will the Government push for population units smaller than the whole region to be eligible? What is the Minister's view of similar communities in a region(for example, new towns across the south-east(grouping together to seek funding under objective 2?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes some interesting points. One of the important aspects of the scrutiny process is listening to what hon. Members of all parties have to say. As we do not have the detailed proposals, it is too early to answer the question, but we shall certainly take my hon. Friend's point into consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to you, Mr. Jones, and to the Comittee for being late. If by being late I have nullified my question, I hope that I shall be forgiven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does Agenda 2000 stipulate that the five countries that are expected to join the European Union must participate in an exchange rate mechanism and avoid excessive exchange rate
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
changes? This country, which is already in the union, has explicitly eschewed membership of the exchange rate mechanism; the Chancellor has forsworn it, at least for the foreseeable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has fully set out the Government's position, which Labour Members warmly endorse. The hon. Gentleman's question may take me into areas for which you, Mr. Jones, would rule me out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the section on agri-environmental policy on page 33 offers interesting dimensions? There is a reference to the considereable overlap between less-favoured areas, which receive one kind of support, and areas of high natural value, which receive another kind of support, and a suggestion of optimising that by encouraging low-intensity farming in areas of natural beauty. In Scotland, for example, that would be a particularly welcome development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an interesting point, which will certainly inform our discussions. The Government favour equity and fairer distribution, and we shall convey to the Commission what has been said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to draw the Minister's attention to page 73 of 998(97), which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"reform of the common agricultural policy"</p></blockquote>
which the Government have stated several times that they support—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will, in the first instance, entail additional expenditure."</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister quantify that additional expenditure and tell the Committee how it relates to the World Trade Organisation agreements? In particular, will she say how the sugar-beet and sheep regimes will be affected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises some very interesting points, which I am sure he will be able to put to my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when the matter is discussed in European Standing Committee A. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is a member of that Committee, but he can attend in order to ask his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jones. That is the third occasion on which the Minister has declined to anser a question and referred to it another Minister. Is it in order for the Minister to decline to answer questions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Gentleman. There will be two more debates in Committee on different topics and, having taken advice, I understand that the question that I allowed the hon. Gentleman to put related to a debate that will take place later, so the hon. Gentleman's original question did not strictly relate to the document that we are discussing today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Jones. The Committee is in some difficulty because several pages in the document are a preamble to all three issues that will be discussed in successive meetings of the Committee. Indeed, the question that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I put to the Minister relating to page 13 of the document, on policy co-ordination and modernising employment, comes before the three detailed proposals on agriculture, financial standing and structural funds. Further to the point of order raised by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), I also wonder whether it is in order for the Minister to decline to answer questions on behalf of the Government on the preamble to the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that it is in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me for pressing her on the geographical criteria for objective 2 funding, and that she will also forgive me for being parochial. My constituency includes Thanet, which is probably the smallest objective 2 area, at least in the United Kingdom and possibly in the whole of Europe. My fear is that if the criteria are applied in the way the Minister described, Thanet will lose its objective 2 status and have no hope of regaining it. So I should like to ask the Minister to comment further on the likelihood of areas, such as Thanet, retaining objective 2 status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me if I do not address my remarks to specific areas in advance of the detailed proposals. Government statisticians are discussing with Eurostat the statistical information that needs to be obtained. I am loth to comment further because the Government have been rigid in their approach of not interfering with the exciting world of statisticians, who, quite rightly, jealously guard their independence in that area. However, I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman's remarks are conveyed because I recognise that concerns exist. That is why the Government want to bring the general principles to the Committee's attention at an early stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I understand the Minister's reluctance to be drawn to comment on small areas of our country, I would ask her to comment on an article in the	<i>Financial Times</i>about 10 days ago, which suggested that the Commission had in mind that Northern Ireland and the highlands and islands of Scotland should both lose objective 1 status. If carried out, those would be major policy changes consequential on the enlargement process. For the sake of industrialists and commerce in those areas, will the Minster vouchsafe a clear answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly recognise that the hon. Gentleman's points are important, and I understand his concern. We recognise that the GDP per capita of Northern Ireland and the highlands and islands is around 80 per cent. of the EU average. I reassure him that the UK will press for the best possible deal for Northern Ireland because of its special circumstances and because we are concerned to underpin the peace process. We are also concerned about the low population density in the highlands and islands. As I said earlier, we shall be waiting to see details of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Commission's proposals. We appreciate and welcome its proposals for the transition and we will be fighting very hard for the UK's interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) about Thanet, the explanatory memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government is developing its own regional policy".</p></blockquote>
Will the Government be taking account of any region that might be affected by changes in European structural funding when they develop their regional policies? If that is not the case, serious divergences of living standards might arise in areas such as Thanet and my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend will appreciate that the two measures are different, although I understand what he is saying. The Government place great importance on regional development, which is why my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made a welcome announcement last week about the regional development agencies. The agencies will play an important role in the development of regional policy. They will also be able to ensure that there are no disparities between the regions. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point raised by the hon. Member for Luton, North, the Minister referred to the linkage in the explanatory memorandum between European regional funds and the development programme of regional support in the UK. If I was not in this Committee this morning, Mr. Jones, I would be in a Select Committee considering the proposals for the regional development agencies. How will departmental responsibilities work together to co-ordinate European funds with domestic programmes that might be established under the aegis of the regional development agencies? Will the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions be the primary Department responsible for regional assistance within the UK, including European funds, or will there be a division between European funds which will be dealt with by the Minister's Department and domestic funding programmes which will be established under the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was all clearly set out by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister last week. The lead Department for the European structural cohesion fund and regional selective assistance(state aids(will continue to be the Department of Trade and Industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my previous question on agri-environmental policy, Ministers in other Committees have stressed the importance of paying greater attention to animal welfare in agriculture. Is my hon. Friend the Minister willing to press for the inclusion of animal welfare as a criteria for targeted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
agri-environmental measures? I understand from contacts on the continent that some other Governments would welcome such a move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tempting as that question may be, it may stray into areas that are not properly my responsibility. I note my hon. Friend's understandable concerns and I will certainly convey them to my colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister will look at page 16 of document 9984/97, which lies within the precise remit of our discussion this morning. What investigation has the Minister's Department made of the proportion of the 45 billion ecu there mentioned which will go to the various countries which are due to accede? In the light of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), does the Minister believe that the zloty and the florin, once locked into the ERM, will be able to survive on the basis of their proportion of the 45 billion ecu?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury will attend the Committee tomorrow to talk about other aspects of the matter and the hon. Gentleman can address that question to her. Estimates have been made([	<i>Interruption</i>]. The hon. Gentleman asked me a proper and serious question, and perhaps he will do me the courtesy of listening to the reply that I am anxious to give. Estimates have been made following our discussions with the Commission and we believe that the figures are sustainable. However, matters concerning the ERM overall are for my colleagues in the Treasury who will have an opportunity to attend the Committee at another time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect that new member states will receive 4 per cent. of GDP by the year 2006. We believe that that is about right for them to be able to absorb the programmes that will lead to enlargement, but the hon. Gentleman will have the opportunity to question my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary in detail at a subsequent sitting of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be argued that the Commission has squared the circle in terms of the structural funds being adapted to cope with enlargement by taking an unrealistic view of growth rates at 2.5 per cent. within the EU during the period 2000–06. What is my hon. Friend's view? If the 2.5 per cent. growth rate is not achieved, will the Government remain with the figure of 0.46 per cent. of GDP and, if so, how will they accommodate that situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have some concerns about the overall amount. We would like the overall figure to be set below 0.46 per cent. and I emphasised that when I spoke to the Commission last Monday. This is an opportunity for the United Kingdom to ensure that we do not have overall amounts increasing and I shall certainly bear in mind my hon. Friend's comments and continue to mention them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
We expect a margin between planned expenditure and any ceiling, which should allow some flexibility on growth rates. We would prefer an amount below the Commission's proposed 0.46 per cent. and we shall press hard for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well understand the Minister's refusal to be drawn on the paradox demonstrated on page 49, paragraph 3 of the document between the United Kingdom's continued refusal to enter the ERM and the requirement stipulated by the Commission on applicant countries to lock their exchange rate mechanisms within a more or less fixed bank of parity. Can she not comprehend that the adoption of the ERM by applicant countries could lead, if the band of parity were inappropriate, to significant levels of unemployment and grave economic damage to the Community as a whole if it was required to pick up the tab for a significant increase in structural funding? Have the Minister and the Treasury come to terms with that? It is an inherent fact about the system of which we are supposed to approve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns. I say in all friendship that I know that he has made those points consistently and over a long period. He knows that he and the Government do not share the same view of the matter, but we do share some of his concerns about getting the structural and cohesion funds under control. Doing so will ensure that they are less bureaucratic, more transparent and less of a burden to the Community. We are keen to protect the United Kingdom's interests in that regard. Tomorrow, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury will make a statement to a European Standing Committee. The hon. Gentleman should put his questions to her([she and the Treasury have primary responsibility for the matters that he raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) read out a very clear passage from the document about the link between future access to cohesion funds and membership of the economic and monetary union. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood asked about the requirements on candidates for accession to the exchange rate mechanism. The Select Committee on European Legislation drew attention to the apparent discrepancy between its interpretation of what I believe is a clearly stated requirement and the Government's interpretation([and the Minister conceded that the Government and the Select Committee differed over that matter. In view of the passage that my hon. Friend read out, how did the Government reach their view that it will not be necessary to be a member of the third stage of economic and monetary union in order to have access to cohesion funds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hard to reconcile the continuation of cohesion fund receipts for member states who get into the first wave of EMU with our general understanding of the situation. Other matters relating to the structural and cohesion funds will probably
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
need to be negotiated. Our reading of the Commission's proposals is that the cohesion funds could potentially benefit those countries that have joined the single currency and those that have not yet done so, but which are meeting the Maastricht convergence criteria. I appreciate that the Select Committee and the Government have different interpretations and that the matter is open to interpretation(as, indeed, is the treaty provision. This is an important matter, which we are seeking to clarify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to discuss respect for minorities, and I am aware that doing so will stray on to the edges of the Minister's responsibilities. The Commission appears to take a very laid-back view of the fact that one quarter of the population of Latvia and Estonia are disfranchised. Page 45 of the document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no evidence that these minorities are subject to discrimination except for problems of access to certain professions in Latvia."</p></blockquote>
The problem of access to the basic right to vote is pretty fundamental. If a member state is seen to be systematically neglecting a large section of its population in that way, that could cause long-term cohesion problems in the EU. Will the Government encourage the Commission to take a slightly more activist stance in that regard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tempted as I am to stray on to matters that are the jealously guarded prerogative of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office(my hon. Friend was kind enough to say that this is a subject for which I am not responsible(I would be unwise to do so. I recognise the serious issues raised by my hon. Friend and shall convey them to my Foreign Office colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to page 20. Has the Minister actually read the Commission's wording? It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Member States whose	<i>per capita</i>GNP is less than 90 per cent. and which take part in the third phase of EMU should remain eligible for assistance from the Fund."</p></blockquote>
How can she say that that is open to interpretation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing like old times. The hon. Gentleman and I have swopped linguistic interpretations of texts at various times. I will not be tempted back into the Wireless Telegraphy Bill, but he and I had a long, but interesting, debate about interpretation of that measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reading the document, one must take into account the specific purpose for which the cohesion funds were created. It is difficult to believe that once that purpose has been fulfilled, availability of funds should continue. As I have said, I accept what the Select Committee said about the difference of interpretation. The Government are anxious to resolve that difference urgently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to page 16 and the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood? The countries that will accede under enlargement have a population of about 100 million. That is approximately one quarter of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
enlarged population, and about one third of the current population. Those countries also represent about 5 per cent. of Community GDP. The current cohesion fund is around 200 billion ecu and it is estimated that 45 million ecu will be added to that, or about one fifth of the enlarged fund and one quarter of the existing fund. How can the Minister explain adding only one quarter to the existing cohesion fund when the countries that will be locked into stage 2 of economic and monetary union, which will not be able to compensate by altering exchange rates, and which have only 5 per cent. of total GDP or a quarter of GDP per capita, are being added? If 100 million people are being added, how do those figures add up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the hon Gentleman's interpretation of how EMU will work. His entire question is based on his interpretation. He will have an opportunity to press his point tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obviously important to increase cost effectiveness. Does my hon. Friend think that increasing decentralisation will help us to do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There should be as little bureaucracy as possible in all Community matters and we will press(more effectively, we hope, than did the previous Government(for a reduction in bureaucracy. We want to make sure that decisions that can be taken by member states will be taken by member states. However, we also welcome the development of regional policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why the Commission has adopted such an arbitrary definition in relation to the applications of the three Baltic states? Is not the European Union supposed to be in the business of cohesion and integration? How can such invidious distinctions help those processes? Is not it true that all those countries are democratic and, to a greater or lesser extent, have modernised economies? In the past two years, I have led parliamentary delegations to Estonia and Latvia and have found little difference between the economies of, say, Riga and Tallin. Why do the Government support a policy that may bring greater discord among countries that deserve to be treated as one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tempts me again. My responsibility is for the cohesion and structural funds, not the cohesion of Europe or the European Union, much as I should enjoy such a responsibility. His questions are important and my colleagues at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will be only too delighted to answer them at the appropriate time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take the Minister back to a question I asked earlier. Did she tell us that her Department has made no estimate of the impact of the rigid application of the 75 per cent. of GDP per capita rule for objective 1 and the redistribution in population cover of the geographically targeted objectives? What is the estimate(if there is one(of the impact on the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult fully to understand the hon. Gentleman's question. The figures are well known. We know what criterion the Commission is suggesting for new objective 1 status; it is 75 per cent. When we discussed Northern Ireland in response to a question asked by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, I said that the figure was 80 per cent. I also said, both to the hon. Gentleman and to his hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood(representing Hornsey and Wood Green I know that it is important to get constituency titles right(that we would be pressing our case hard. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that in this period of negotiation, we are waiting for the Commission's detailed proposals to emerge. I am sure that he will accept that we shall do our best in discussions to ensure that we get the best possible deal for the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the new objective 2, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Minister and our colleagues. My constituency of Halton has objective 2 status. Specific points have been made in the Committee on the difficult structural problems facing declining areas, crisis-hit areas dependent on the fishing industry and urban areas in difficulty. My area is dependent on the chemical industry, which is the largest employer in Halton. ICI(the single largest employer(recently announced that it is pulling out and that it hopes to sell off its businesses. There are major concerns about the future and the difficulties that might arise from the possible loss of objective 2 status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially interested in my hon. Friend the Minister's comments on statistical information. I understand that she does not want to comment further on that, but how are specific areas of regions, which are obviously on a much smaller scale, identified if they have particular structural problems? I ask her to take account of my comments in future discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly give my hon. Friend those reassurances. The new objective 2 area will cover other industrial areas not covered by new objective 1. It will include urban areas, rural areas and fisheries areas facing restructuring. We do not know what detailed criteria will be applied. I assure the Committee that I have told the Commission that it is best to collect statistical details, especially those on local, small areas, at a national rather than a European level. They are more accurate and thorough, and are all-encompassing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for an earlier answer in which she clarified what she believes she is responsible for(the cohesion fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The structural and cohesion funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister believes that she is responsible for the structural and cohesion funds. Laying aside European monetary union and stage two, I want to return to straightforward figures. The Minister acknowledged that we are adding about 100 million people from the newly acceding countries, which is equivalent to one quarter of the new population. She accepted that that represented,
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
roughly speaking, one quarter of GDP per capita of existing states. She has also acknowledged(as I think she had to because it is in the document(that 45 billion ecu is being added to the funds for which she says that she is responsible. That is approximately one quarter of the current cohesion fund. Acceding countries have one quarter of GDP per capita and one third of the population, yet we are adding only 25 per cent. of the amount currently given to the cohesion fund. How can she make those figures tally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's point and do not see the problem in making those figures tally. The overall figures are in the document and the money will be phased in from accession to 2006. As we said, it will be 4 per cent. of GDP. The hon. Gentleman is scrabbling around for figures and his interpretation of those figures does not make sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New objective 3 identifies four areas of human resources strategy: accompanying economic and social changes; lifelong education and training systems; active labour market policies to fight unemployment and combating social exclusion. That sounds very much like the Labour party manifesto. Will the Minister welcome and enthusiastically support the introduction of the objective, which I imagine might result in substantial support for some of our programmes in less developed areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support the overall approach of new objective 3. Clearly, the new Government's work on education and training and on the important problem of social exclusion is in line with the new objective, and we warmly support the Commission's approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to new objective 3, the Commission states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is required both to make their economies competitive and for reasons related to safeguarding the European model of society."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain what she understands by the "European model of society" and, in view of the increasing globalisation of the economy, does not she feel that that phrase betrays a somewhat inward-looking mentality on behalf of the Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think that at all. I am very much looking forward to the United Kingdom taking over the presidency of the EU on 1 January 1998 when we shall be pressing the key areas of flexibility, employability and competitiveness. In April, under the UK presidency, we will hold an important event in order to encourage enterprise. That will be a watchword of our presidency, and it has been warmly welcomed by the Commission and by our EU partners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that very point, I welcome the Minister's attitude to the process. Clearly, she will be batting for Britain. On the matter of the presidency, what does the Minister think the difference will be between our attitude and approach and that of the Conservative party a few years ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise to be as restrained as possible in my response to that question. The UK will play a leading role in Europe and will put on the agenda the issues of flexibility, employability and competitiveness, at the same time as getting a fair deal for the UK, especially in terms of the structural and cohesion funds. The fact that the Government are positively engaged in Europe will help the United Kingdom considerably to reach its aims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 29 of the explanatory memorandum, on the financial implications of the document, states that by combining the structural funds, the cohesion fund and pre-accession aid, the Commission estimates that 35.2 billion ecu could be committed in 2000, rising to 42.8 billion ecu by 2006, at 1997 prices. That implies a significant real increase in the cost of the funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister satisfied that the electorate in the UK will acquiesce in that? In its section on policy implications, the Minister's explanatory memorandum notes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Structural and Cohesion Funds are to remain affordable following enlargement of the EU, all existing Member States will have to accept a significantly lower level of receipts in the next century."</p></blockquote>
Is that a price worth paying, or, as the Commission postulates, will the European Union have to adapt its own resources formula to secure more revenue for expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the serious points that the hon. Gentleman is making. I talked earlier about our principle, which the Commission recognises, that the EU budget must be contained within its current share of GDP. That is why we have said that the overall cost of the structural and cohesion funds should be kept below 0.46 per cent. of EU GNP before and after enlargement. That is why we want a lower figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I try just one last time to get the Minister to tell us(now or in writing(how 45 billion ecu has been calculated as the sum to cover the acceding countries in the cohesion funds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the details are in the documents. These are interesting matters, but if the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If no more members wish to ask questions, we shall proceed to debate the motion. Before that, it may benefit the Committee if I clarify the scope of the debate. Agenda 2000 has been referred for three separate debates in European Standing Committee. Today's debate is about structural and cohesion policy. The common agricultural policy will be dealt with in European Standing Committee A tomorrow.

	<p>11.28 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Fallon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sevenoaks)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I offer you a belated, but warm, welcome to the Chair, Mr. Jones, and thank you for your guidance on the scope of the debate. Some confusion arose because the Commission clearly sees the funds as having a wider purpose of generally improving employment and the economy of Europe. It is, therefore, disappointing that our questions about the preliminary chapters, which cover all three aspects of the document, were simply shrugged off by the Minister, who advised us to write to some other Minister about them. She has ministerial responsibility for the funds and should be able to answer particular questions on pension funds and health-care systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum with which the Minister has furnished the Committee is certainly one of the shoddiest that I have seen. She denies overall responsibility for the document as a whole, and what she sets out in paragraph 24 as Government policy is almost exactly the same as Conservative policy, as expressed to this very Committee on 19 March. It was the former Minister for Industry, Mr. Greg Knight, who first set out the policy that any new regime for the structural funds in an enlarged European Union should have a ceiling of 0.46 per cent. of the EU GNP or preferably lower. Mr. Knight said that the structural fund's reform should be "fair" and, at column 4 of the Committee's proceedings on 19 March, "affordable". He also said that that reform should be "durable" and that the funds should be more effective and administratively simpler. The Minister has just copied out the Conservative policy on structural and cohesion funds, which is rather disappointing after six months in Government. She could not even think of any new adjectives with which to describe that policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman describes the presentation as shoddy, is that comment related to the alleged resemblance to the Conservatives' programme? Is he claiming that the Opposition are responsible for all areas of the document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may assist the hon. Gentleman, the document is the responsibility of the Commission. I am discussing the explanatory memorandum, which is what the Minister uses to set out the Government's policy. I am accusing the Minister(although I did not want to use such a word(of laziness in replicating the exact phraseology of Conservative policy on the structural fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more serious that, in paragraph 25 of the explanatory memorandum, the Minister simply says that it is too early to estimate the impact of the proposals on the United Kingdom's regions. It is not acceptable for the Select Committee to recommend documents for debate and for the Minister to say that she has no policy of her own, that she is happy to copy

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
out the Conservative policy and that she cannot be bothered to measure the estimated effects of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 19 March(only nine months ago(the Labour party's policy on structural and cohesion funds was described fully by the hon. Member for Pontypridd Dr. Howells), who is now the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment. I do not know whether the Minister has forgotten that policy, whether she is ignoring it or whether it has been reversed in another U-turn. I will describe Labour's five-point plan for the structural and cohesion funds, as it existed in March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the hon. Member for Pontypridd called for a higher proportion of the programmes to be addressed to small and medium-sized enterprises. I should have thought that that objective would commend itself to the Minister, as she has responsibilities for small business. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman suggested that only one fund should be applied to each region, rather than a multiplicity of funds applying in different regions. Thirdly, he drew attention to the problems that the voluntary sector experienced in becoming eligible for the funds as a result of the rules about contributions in kind. Fourthly, he suggested that match funding should be reduced. Fifthly, he suggested that small and medium-sized enterprises(which are allegedly a cause that is dear to the Minister's heart(should have direct access to the funds. That was the Labour party's policy on 19 March, but it now seems to have vanished without trace and not to have reappeared in the explanatory memorandum. No doubt that Minister will explain the disappearing Labour policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may come into the hon. Gentleman's mind as the social security debate proceeds tomorrow(but I must not be tempted further down that path. I suspect that we shall all be driven to rereading the appropriate chapters of "Animal Farm".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not endorsing Labour party policy; I am telling the Minister what Labour's five-point plan was for the structural and cohesion funds as recently as March in European Standing Committee B. Will the Minister explain what has happened to her party's policy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to paragraph 25 of the memorandum and the question of impact, to which my hon. Friends have drawn attention. It will not do for the Minister to say that she cannot estimate the impact of the changes on the regions of the United Kingdom, or to say, as she did at one point, that the impact has not been estimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to inform the Minister that the impact on UK regions was spelt out in great detail by the Director-General for Regional Policy and Cohesion in the Commission, Mr. Landáburu Illarramendi, on 30
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
November. He said very precisely that Northern Ireland, which currently receives some£830 million-worth of assistance, and the Scottish highlands and islands, receiving some£210 million-worth of assistance, would disappear from objective 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, Mr. Landáburu said that South Yorkshire would be added, in view of the coal mining redundancies, real and anticipated, resulting from the Government's lack of a coal policy. Moreover, he stated that Cornwall had failed in its application, and would be unlikely to receive objective 1 status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Commission can make that estimate of the impact of the changes, surely the Department of Trade and Industry has done the same? Of course it has, but the Minister is not prepared to reveal its estimate to the Committee. That is a shoddy way in which to treat the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission proposes a reduction in overall coverage from 51 per cent. of the current 15 member states of the European Union to around 35 per cent. to 40 per cent. The Minister has again told us that she cannot estimate the implications for the United Kingdom. It is not too difficult; with the assistance of the Library, I was able to do so yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer the Committee some figures. Around 40 per cent. of the United Kingdom population is currently covered by the funds(approximately 23 million people. Of those people 3·4 million are covered under objective 1; just under 20 million are covered under the other objectives. I can tell the Committee that the Commission's proposal will reduce coverage by between 22 per cent. and 31 per cent. (an average of 25 per cent. Under the proposals, the population of this country covered by the funds will therefore fall to around 30 per cent. Does the Minister agree with that estimate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a range of other issues on which hon. Members have had no clue about the Government's thinking. I hope that the Minister will address each of them when she comes to wind up the debate. The Commission proposes transitional periods for regions that will lose their objective 1 status. That is especially important for Northern Ireland and the Scottish highlands and islands. However, the Commission does not stipulate how long such transitional periods should be. Does the Minister know what the Commission's thinking is on the matter? How long a transitional period does the United Kingdom want?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission wants to keep the cohesion fund roughly as it is for existing member states(I shall discuss the position of applicant member states in a moment. Do the Government agree with the cohesion fund's current coverage? Do they think that it should continue to apply, for example, to the whole of the Republic of Ireland? Do they agree with the cohesion fund's scale(it will amount to some£3 billion ecu from the year 2000? The explanatory memorandum contains no policy at all on the cohesion fund. My hon. Friends have pressed the Minister on the question of enlargement, about which we especially want to know and which I shall discuss later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I hope that the Minister will respond to two matters that the document raises. First, the Commission is proposing, I believe for the first time, that a substantial proportion of the structural fund at least 10 per cent.(should be kept back in a reserve and that, under the regulations, it would be allocated later in the cyle on a performance-related basis. Does the Minister agree that the Commission should hold back funds in that way and allocate them on a performance-related basis, as regions improve their economic prospects and demonstrate that they are using initial allocations wisely? Does she suspect that that sort of reserve might later be applied more loosely than the original funding allocations? It may even be used for political purposes(who knows?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the document suggests that the structural funds should be accompanied by other state measures, which are helpfully listed by the Commission on page 22. The Commission believes that the multiplier effect of structural funds should be increased by greater use of other forms of assistance, which amounts to an open invitation to member states to multiply the number and extent of state aids. Helpfully, the Commission makes no bones about the matter: it refers to publicly funded "interest-rate subsidies", to "guarantees", to state-organised "venture capital holdings" and to what are coyly called "other holdings", which I think means a direct public equity stake in a failing business. What is the Government's view of those subsidies? Do they think that it is a good thing to encourage member states to go down the path involving those subsidies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to enlargement, the Opposition have always taken a wider view of the European Community. We have often suspected that the integrationist agenda of some of those in the Commission in Brussels has been designed to frustrate efforts to achieve the enlargement that we have always supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my enforced absence from the House of Commons I spent some time travelling round the poorer countries of eastern Europe, including Bulgaria, Romania and Lithuania. Those countries desperately need trade with the EU, access for their agricultural produce and early assistance to accede to the Union. The previous Government arranged for the industrial products of those countries to have access to the EU(under the general agreement on tariffs and trade, there are now no barriers to industrial produce, although there are still barriers to agricultural produce. it appears that the Commission is erecting a wholly new barrier. That is contrary to the Maastricht treaty, which allowed for member states to opt out of the single currency. The Commission will now insist that if member states are to qualify for assistance from the cohesion funds, they must be involved in the third stage of economic and monetary union. That is why the Opposition are puzzled by the Minister's attempts to pretend that paragraph 3 on page 20 is open to misinterpretation. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is proposed that this fund be maintained in its present form; Member states whose	<i>per capita</i>GNP is less than 90 per cent. and which take part in the third phase of EMU should remain eligible for assistance from the Fund."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
The document does not say "may" take part in the third phase of EMU, and it does not say "or" which take part. The document makes it clear that eligibility is to be restricted to members states that participate in the third phase of EMU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises a horrifying scenario in which the Commission has two choices: either to continue to block accession of the poorest member states, such as Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania, on the ground that they cannot participate in the single currency; or, having half lured them in, to set this condition for receipt of the funds and tell the richer member states that the 0.46 per cent. ceiling must be broken, with a massive increase in the structural and cohesion funds to facilitate enlargement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree with that scenario? How does she justify her so-called misinterpretation of one of the plainer sentences in the document?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other members of the Committee will wish to speak. The document seems to develop the Commission's fledgling industrial and social policy. There are some dramatic references in the document to the need for a common health care system and a common pension fund system. However, the outline of the social industrial policy should alarm us most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one of its rare expressions of a view, the Government questioned why the community initiatives(currently about 13(should not be reduced to just three. Cross-border and transnational co-operation is understandable, rural development is obviously not unhelpful to the UK but the third initiative is equal opportunities. In promoting more flexibility, employability and competitiveness, why should the Minister or the Commission think that promotion of equal opportunities should be among the top three initatives promoted by the Community?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On industrial policy, I have already drawn attention to the key final paragraph of page 22 in which the Commission invites member states to multiply the effect of the structural funds by resorting to a battery of state aids to industry and employment. Those aids were originally to be policed under competition policy and reduced. The Opposition see this point as a dangerous start to a more determined effort by the Commission to construct its own European industrial policy. It embodies the old concept of taxing successful businesses to subsidise the unsuccessful that we have slowly and painfully stripped out of our own regional policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a role for Government in regional policy. The Conservative party has a considerable record. The Minister will recall that Stanley Baldwin was the first to channel assistance towards special areas. But the Conservatives have been careful about regional policy, seeing its role as improving the infrastructure to the regions where recovery is desired and refurbishing industrial environment. Specific help for specific industrial sectors should be targeted, should not be permanent and, above all, should not be distortive. The Opposition believe that the Commission's proposals fail that test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard standard Conservative party tub-thumping and I have no doubt that as the contributions from the Opposition Benches proceed during the next hour, we shall hear the usual gamut of xenophobia and Europhobia that we are always privileged to hear in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome my Friend the Minister's open approach to the document and her comment that nothing is locked down in it and that it contains only proposals. She said that the Government will listen to constructive contributions on how those proposals can be improved and that they will go out and bat for Britain to win those improvements. I welcome that approach and congratulate the Minister and the Government. I have no doubt that the Government will also listen to some of the views previously expressed when we were in Opposition and will take account of many of the points made by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), some of which are included in the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall miss an opportunity when negotiating on the document if we do not look more deeply into the way in which the funds are administered and distributed, and the document refers to that. This country has considerable experience of the way in which funds are administered and we could build on that to improve the process in future. My constituency includes Thanet, which is one of the smaller objective 2 areas. It is a single district council area and is unique in being the only district council area that receives objective 2 funding in its own right. That is significant because that objective 2 area is coterminous with a district council which has a leader, chief executive, ruling party and an opposition party. All those groups and individuals focus on the way in which objective 2 funding is administered in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other areas, objective 2 funding is spread over several council areas, so a partnership body is created to administer the funding and it is difficult for a particular council, group or individual to focus on the way in which the money is administered because it is the responsibility of many people. Confusion often arises, but we do not have that problem in Thanet because we are very close to the way in which the funding is distributed. That has allowed me to observe some of the problems that we should tackle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem is the tension that arises between the Government office and the European Commission and the case-workers responsible for objective 2 status. Tensions arise from the way the objectives of the fund are interpreted. Individuals within local communities work on projects and put forward action plans which go all the way through the local process to a Government office where they may be kicked out. They are then rewritten and eventually put forward to European offices where they may again be kicked out because they are thought not to meet the view of the objectives of the Commission in some way. Often, those objectives are interpreted by relatively junior case-workers whose views are not taken into consideration sufficiently early in the process. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
causes the most tremendous confusion and demoralisation within the local community. It also means that it takes a long time to spend the funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document suggests that there should be rewards for those areas that are efficient at spending the funding. I take that to mean that if one produces an action plan for spending in a particular area and, during the three or six years of the programme, one keeps to that action plan and spends the money on time and exactly as it is supposed to be spent, one will be rewarded with extra money. That sounds great, but the problem is the administrative nightmare and bureaucracy that must be gone through in order to spend the money, which means that there is no possibility of the money being spent on time, which means that there will be no reward. That will only make the problem worse, so that there will be even more money left over at the end of the programme. These difficulties must be recognised, and we should use this opportunity to talk not only about the amount of funding that will be available and the overall criteria for distributing it, but about the possibility of using the process to determine an easier and better way of spending the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the attitude of the previous Government, I was reading the documents when I had a blinding flash of inspiration and realised, for the first time, what the industrial policy of the previous Government had been. Their policy was to try to reduce the domestic output per capita in this country to such a low level that the entire nation would become eligible for objective 1 funding. As we tried to spend objective 2 funding in Thanet, it became clear to me that the principles of additionality were not being applied in this country. The money from obejective 2 funding was not added to money that was already available to Thanet; it was used instead of Government funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talked about funding for research, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) said that spending money from Europe, in addition to money that is already available, was a trick played by foreigners in order to take advantage of us nice Brits, who were doing the sensible thing and using it to substitute for money that would otherwise be provided by the Government. This is not the basis on which objective 2 money is provided. Objective 1 and objective 2 funding is supposed to be provided on the basis of additionality. I can give the Committee an example of how that is not working in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As objective 2 funding must be matched by other funding before it can be spent, Thanet, which does not have any money, was given£12 million in the first round of objective 2, but we could not spend it because we could not match it. So we applied for single regeneration budget funding and, in round one, we magically received enough money to match our European funding, so we were able to spend it. By the time of SRB round two, we did not have any more European money that we needed to match, so we did not succeed in getting any SRB round two money. But, by the time of SRB round three, once again, Europe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
had given us some more money, which we could not match, so we were successful in getting SRB round three money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has been the process in Thanet, with the previous Government trickling down to us just enough money to enable us to spend European funding. Whenever we have proposed a project, Government Departments completely dissociated from European activities have formed an opinion and said, "No, that is not a project that we would want the Government to fund." Under the previous Administration, the Department of Trade and Industry scrapped a major leisure project in my constituency on the ground that it did not think it worthy enough. There is example after example of additionality principles not being applied. If we are to take advantage of the new regime of funding, whether under objective 1, 2 or 3, we must get it right. Additionality must be applied. We must ensure that funds are administered efficiently and that the views of local people on how the money is spent are taken into consideration. If we do that, we shall go a long way to making the funding work for Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) used typically emotive language in his opening remarks. He accused us in our scrutiny of the documents, as others have done in previous sittings, of xenophobia and Europhobia. To be candid, such allegations do not stand sensible critical examination. Our duty is to our constituents and our country. Just because we put those responsibilities first does not mean that we care any less for other countries in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Government are being malign in their approach to these matters. I do not even think that they are being wilfully stupid. I merely think that they are being pathetically naive. That is the problem. The Government are full of good intentions. If those good intentions lead to photo opportunities and to excellent media coverage, so much the better—they do not hide their light under a bushel—but their naivety is truly alarming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 14 of Agenda 2000, paragraph 1 of the section on economic and social cohesion is called
	<br><blockquote><p>"Continuing to Strive for Cohesion".</p></blockquote>
Its sub-heading is, "Maintaining the political priority". Those headings say it all. The paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The treaty on European Union turned cohesion into one of the three pillars of the European construction alongside economic and monetary union and the Single Market."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the treaty on European Union was ever-closer union. Do our constituents want us to approve measures for the extension of cohesion and structural funds to 2006, which has particular relevance to the applicant countries to the Union? Do they want those funds to lead to an ever-closer union in Europe which will diminish their control over the decisions that determine their economic destiny?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
The Minister referred to the workings of Eurostat, by which all will be decided. Eurostat will, I presume, rule whether a region has a	<i>per capita</i>gross national product less than 90 per cent. of the EU average, in which case it will qualify for cohesion aid. Eurostat will decide whether a region has 75 per cent. or less of GNP per head to qualify for objective 1, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statistical processes taken on the continent are very remote from the lives of our citizens. Statistical decisions could crucially affect the marginal profitability of enterprises on which our constituents depend for their livelihood. I would argue—anyone of my persuasion would do the same—that to generate sustainable growth, prosperity and good employment prospects in our country, we must ensure that the interests of our people predominate and that our constituents affect the decisions of Government in a way that will ameliorate their own condition. The trouble is that governance is coming increasingly from Brussels and that the Labour Government here in Westminster acquiesce to that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks, who has great experience of eastern Europe, eloquently discussed trade and agrucultural products from those countries. They do not want to perpetuate our continent's divisions—there have been enough of those since 1945. They want to be brought into the community of free, sovereign, democratic nations, each of which decides its own economic destiny. In many instances, the largest export products from central and eastern Europe are in the agricultural sector, and they are specifically excluded by the malign influence of Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process of separating sheep from goats perpetuates a feeling of invidiousness and, in some cases, a disappointment that verges on despair. All my political life—for what it is worth—I have fought for freedom and self-determination behind the iron curtain. That curtain came down, and the countries did everything right—they modernised their economies, privatised, set up privately owned banks and liberalised their trade. But then what were they told? Latvia was told, "You happen to have a lot of Russians within your borders who continue to insist on speaking Russian and do not therefore qualify for citizenship. Consequently, you must take second status to Estonia." What about Lithuania, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks referred? Is it helpful to make such invidious distinctions? I do not believe that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a much more comprehensive policy that will give products from those countries free access to our markets and we want to move away from the increasingly costly and mechanistic process of providing EU support via cohesion and structural funds. That system does not benefit our citizens in the medium or longer term. As those funds are increasingly diverted to applicant countries in central and eastern Europe, the money that is available to the United Kingdom—to the highlands and islands, for example—is likely to decline, which is very sad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Minister has taken to these important matters. I want to put three points, which are of serious moment and considerable concern, to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I do so, however, I must respond to the speech of the hon. Member for Sevenoaks. I shall long remember his pearl of wisdom; he said that the Labour party was following the Tory policy towards the European Union. I shall remember his observation the next time that there is a debate on the Floor of the House and the hon. Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Stone (Mr. Cash)—and other Conservative Members—criticise the Labour party for its policy towards the European Union. That pearl of wisdom is now on the record and it will be used in future debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we examine the hon. Gentleman's statement in more detail, we expose it as the nonsense that it is. Does he believe that the Government will follow the previous Government's policy? According to a Court of Auditors report, less than 1 per cent. of the funds that were available for small and medium-sized enterprises were taken up under the previous Government. The report also states that less than 48 per cent. of that meagre amount was targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises. Those are not my or the Labour party's words; they come from the Court of Auditors. If that is what the hon. Gentleman meant, he is right to say that this Government will not follow the previous Government's policy. If he means that we will not follow their policy of making not one under objective 4, which deals with critical retraining for people who need to acquire more skills, he is right. We will not follow that policy, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm. We intend to be positive towards the European Union, even where we are critical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's reference to cohesion funds is rich coming from a former Conservative Minister who took part in opposing, tooth and nail, the setting up of the cohesion fund. We need not take any lessons from the hon. Member for Sevenoaks about the fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"to meet the challenges of the single market."—[	<i>Official Report, European Standing Committee B,</i>19 March 1997; c. 20.1</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recall that statement, which I made as a criticism of the previous Government's record on small and medium-sized enterprises. I shall leave my hon. Friend the Minister to answer the point in detail, but if I were the hon. Member for Sevenoaks, I would
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
not hold my breath. The Government's policy towards SMEs is completely different from that of the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks also talked about the Commission's power, and I agree with him on that. I was extremely disappointed when the previous Government shovelled more executive authority, without accountability, in that direction from 1986 onwards. We got the target wrong on accountability then, and we may still have the wrong target. We should target the Commission, not the Council. However, from 1986, the previous Government enthusiastically pursued their policy. I am disappointed that Conservative Members should tell us that the Commission has too much power, when they were responsible for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make three points about the serious and fundamental issues in the document, the motivation for documents on structural and cohesion policy being threefold. First, there is enlargement, which many hon. Members have touched on. That is a significant issue and there is no real dispute over it. Secondly, there are real concerns that the structural funds have not been as effective as we would like. Thirdly, there are budgetary pressures. It might help our debate to keep it in mind that those are the three motivating factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is the form of the cohesion and structural funds and resources. Objective 1 will be more or less protected, and the cohesion fund seems to be protected. We are considering a small increase elsewhere, but the percentage attracted by the cohesion fund will be the same in 1999. Although there is no increase, there is, nevertheless, a certain amount of protection. Overall, therefore, it is reasonable to say that in terms of the structural and cohesion funds, there is no great increase in resources, a point made by the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission tells us not to worry: funds can be made available through fewer programmes, targeting and more concentration, and more effective and efficient delivery of programmes. That is all well and good; that may be an agenda on which we can work. I see nothing wrong—in principle—with any of those three points made by the Commission. I have severe doubts about how it may work out in practice, but I think that most of us can grasp the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is not mentioned in the reports, however, is any transfer of funds from the common agricultural policy. I realise that I may be ruled out of order if I start discussing that, and I do not intend to do so. I do, however, believe that it is a fair point to make. If we are to have pressures on the structural and cohesion policies and funds, and more wasteful expenditure on agriculture, we shall be spending more money on set-aside for farmers to do nothing, and less money on structural funds that are designed to improve the infrastructure and the job prospects of millions of our fellow citizens in the UK and in Europe. I mention the point to the Minister as I believe it is an extremely significant one in terms of resources and funds for structural and cohesion policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you, Mr. Jones, will not immediately rule me out of order if I make another important point. I cannot understand how we can discuss structural and cohesion policies without taking into account the effects of economic and monetary union. There are two ways in which that issue impacts directly on the matter under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it has been argued that EMU will not work unless there is a massive transfer of funds from a central budget. Secondly—without tempting your wrath, Mr. Jones—there is an argument that EMU will not work without significant labour mobility. I believe that there is some merit in both arguments. Those factors are bound to affect the structural and cohesion fund policy under discussion. I ask the Minister to take those points fully into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxiety has been expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet about the effect of any changes in the UK. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks, in an opening speech that I thought was rather carping, spent some time on objective 1. I recorded no reference in his speech to objective 2. I do not know what we are to read into that: either he was simply trying to make some political points against the Government, or it had slipped his mind that objective 2 was extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest challenge faced by my hon. Friend the Minister and the Government is to negotiate to ensure that two things happen. First, the funds available for objective 2 should at least be maintained. That is politically possible if we are prepared to deal with the enormous amount of wasteful expenditure that still takes place in the European Union. Secondly, in considering objective 2—the details are yet to come—the Government will have an enormous task on their hands to make it available to smaller areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not need to wait for the film; we can read the book. This, I promise, will be my sole reference to my constituency. Stoke-on-Trent, South did not have the sympathy of the previous Government when trying to obtain regional assistance—I am sure that that had nothing to do with the fact that Stoke had returned three Labour Members; we were completely turned down. We then approached the European Community. Stoke-on-Trent's overall travel-to-work area suffered tremendous unemployment; in some black spots, unemployment reached 30 per cent., 35 per cent. or even higher. It seems ludicrous that the previous Government would not recognise that. The result of making an approach to Europe was that, on a
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
ward boundary basis, specific areas in my constituency were accepted as objective 2 areas. That is an interesting precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that if we go into the negotiations taking a general rearguard action—a broad-brush approach—against any Commission proposals that would adversely affect the United Kingdom, we may not be as successful as we hope. However, I believe that if we grasp the nettle, and identify unemployment black spots, industrial decline, environmental degradation and so on, we shall receive not only a sympathetic hearing but a positive reaction from the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful, Mr. Jones, that you have allowed me to stray marginally to matters not in the Committee's remit this morning, but I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to consider these points carefully. This will be one of the most crucial issues to face the European Union during the next decade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As so often, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) made an interesting contribution. I want to pick on some of the points that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I preface my remarks by saying that the purpose of the Committee has perplexed many Opposition Members. Often, it seems that Ministers have little interest in the proceedings of the Committee and still less in answering questions. We saw a good example of that this morning. However, the Committee occasionally helps by providing the House with an education. The document before us contains a profoundly educative series of statements. First is the possibly ambiguous phrase, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks drew attention. One reading of it suggests that only those members of the European Union who take part in the third phase of EMU will be eligible to participate in the cohesion. Whether it is read in that way, there can be no doubt that the statement on page 49 to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood has repeatedly drawn attention makes clear that member states that accede to the Union will be forced, if the Commission's proposals are accepted, to enter into stage two of EMU and to take part in the exchange rate mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was careful not to deny any of those figures, although she was wholly unable to explain them—she also pointed me to a table that failed to explain them—but there is no doubt that, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) has said, the total amount of cohesion funding will be broadly neutral across time; about 45 billion ecu is the amount allocated for the newly acceding states. That is profoundly educative because it shows what, I have to admit, I was unaware of before reading the papers—perhaps, alas, exhibiting the naivety, in a moderate form, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood has convincingly accused the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
I had imagined that the rhetoric employed not only by the British Government and other Governments, but the Commission and its President in favour of enlargement was an accurate representation of a state of mind. However, anyone reading the document and making the points that I have raised is bound to come to the conclusion that the Commission's view is wholly opposite to that. I do not believe that that needs to be a matter of political controversy, because I believe that the view that there should be enlargement is genuinely shared by the two major political parties in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other members of the Committee, I have spent much of the past 10 years working in eastern and central Europe and, based on that experience, I would say that to force communities that are in the process of an extremely anguished transition into locked exchange rates—to which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood said, we ourselves do not feel able to accede—under conditions where the amount of cohesion and structural funding available to compensate for the severe imbalances that in the early years such a locked exchange rate created, and where the zloty or forint have traditionally been allowed to devalue progressively and where the amount available to redress those imbalances in the structural cohesion funds is limited to the figure of 45 billion ecu across 100,000 million people, is an example of what I believe the Commission would term mauvaise foi—bad faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an example of an attempt to create an armlock where, despite the rhetoric that the Commission is in favour of enlargement, there is an endeavour on the one side to impose a condition and on the other to withhold funding, thereby ensuring that even if a country fulfilled the condition, the lack of funding would make the transition too painful and that, if the proposals are accepted, there would be little possibility of the country itself wishing to proceed with accession when it understands the terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may not be the whole of the strategy that emerges from the document. The Commission may intend to use the 45 billion ecu, calculated on the basis which the Minister has not, in the slightest degree, been able to explain—and which I presume the Commission has probably therefore not informed her about. I doubt that her unwillingness is because she knows the answer but does not want to tell the Committee; it is probably because she does not have any idea herself. If she has no idea, it is probably because the Commission has not given her any idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore possible that the Commission intends to use a large part—perhaps even all—of the 45 billion ecu in respect of just one of the countries involved. If it had that agenda of creating the double threat that I have been describing and of allowing just one of the countries to pass into the Union, using the whole or a great part of the 45 billion ecu to make that transition possible, that would be a rational explanation of why the Commission is proposing to impose such a stiff criterion for entry as the immediate joining of the second stage, why it is limiting the funds to 45 billion ecu and why it believes that no explanation should be
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
given of how the 45 billion ecu has been calculated. If it were revealed that it was calculated as the amount necessary to minister to the transitional pain of only one country, the game would be in the open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that aim is the Commission's ambition, in the first place it is the duty of the British Government to bring that fact out. Secondly and more profoundly, it is the duty of the British Government to understand it. If that is not the ambition of the Commission, it is the duty of the British Government to explain and to understand exactly the Commission's proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot stand before the Committee, charged as she is with responsibility for the cohesion and structural funds, and say that it is not within her purview to look at the connection between enlargement, the cohesion and structural funds and EMU. The hon. Lady is not merely a cog in a large apparatus; she is a Minister of the Crown, as a result of which she must do some thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the application of the cohesion and structural funds to the newly acceded states is a critical determinant of whether those states can accede. The hon. Lady must consider the connection between those three matters. I hope that, in her closing remarks, she may do what she so abundantly failed to do in Question Time, which is to explain whether she believes that I am wrong about the ambitions of the Commission or whether I am right. She must explain the reason for the low figure of 45 billion ecu, say what the EMU stage two requirement is and tell us what the Government propose to do about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the motion as, I am sure, do other Labour Members. I have every confidence that the Minister will bat well for Britain, although I am not sure that that cricket metaphor will be appreciated by our colleagues in the Council of Ministers. Nevertheless, I am sure that my hon. Friend will do her best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason why Labour Members are concerned about the matter is that—puting aside Northern Ireland—most of the funds are spent in industrial and urban constituencies of the type that we represent rather than those represented by Conservative Members which seem, almost exclusively at present, to be agricultural and rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, neither my constituency of Runnymede and Weybridge nor those of my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some cases, the constituencies of Conservative Members may be described as agricultural, while others may be described as leafy and suburban, but they cannot be described as industrial areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be negotiating in difficult circumstances. Undoubtedly, there is constraint on the funds and there is downward pressure by other member states, notably Germany. Considerable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
hostility is felt towards such spending in Bavaria. It is governed by an extremely conservative party—the Christian Social Union—which probably has more in common with Conservative Members than with us. Regional spending was agreed as part of Britain's negotiations when we entered the old common market—the European Economic Community. We want to protect that and to ensure that it works to our advantage and to that of the entire European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government strongly support enlargement because it will force some rethinking to take place on the matters that are wrong with the EU, especially the comon agricultural policy to which I referred earlier. We want to engineer a situation where the distribution of budgetary spending correlates much more closely with GDP per head—with living standards—than it currently does. Those of us who support structural and cohesion spending want it to be used to promote real economic convergence between member states and between regions within member states. Such redistribution helps economic growth. In any economy, the redistribution of funds from the more affluent to the less affluent, and to those with a greater propensity to consume, generates a higher rate of growth. Faster growth in the EU is good not only in terms of equality and social justice but for everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funds should promote equality and economic growth. If they do not, there is something profoundly wrong with them; it is a serious problem if they promote lower levels of growth and economic divergence between the member states and regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain is one of the poorer nations of the present EU, but one of the larger net contributors to the budget. That is anomalous and should be addressed in any new budget arrangements. Let us compare our situation with that of Ireland. Ireland is a substantial beneficiary of EU funds, yet some would argue that its GDP per head and living standards are slightly higher than ours. That is unacceptable in any fair international arrangement. Denmark, too, is a substantial beneficiary, yet its GDP per head is substantially higher than Britain's. There are anomalies; there is a lack of correlation between EU spending and GDP per head. I am sure that the Government will tackle that in the renegotiations of spending arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The budget has two basic problems. The first relates to agriculture and the CAP, although that is not strictly a matter for this Committee. The CAP must be fundamentally reformed, and the Government are committed to that. On the theory of comparative advantage, it is economically damaging to spend too much on things that one is not good at producing and not enough on things that one is good at producing. We spend too much on agriculture and too little on industry. We must press for a progressive reduction in CAP spending and a progressive increase in spending on other areas to secure faster economic growth, rising propsperity and success for EU member states in the world economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Secondly, we must achieve fairer treatment for Britain in the structural and cohesion funds. There must be real economic convergence and we must promote economic growth in Britain and in the European Union. Most importantly, we must pursue macro-economic policies that promote growth and do not deflate the economies of the EU. If we do not, all the redistributive benefits of structural and cohesion spending will be overwhelmed by the deflationary impact of restricted fiscal and monetary policies. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South, touched on that point, and I strongly support his view that EMU could be unviable if we do not make substantial provision for fiscal transfers between member states and regions; there must be provision for enormous fiscal transfers if EMU is to succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.39 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the late hour, I will endeavour to be brief to give the Minister time to respond to the various points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said in her explanatory memorandum that this is the first stage in a long negotiation. I congratulate her on her diplomatic way of saying that this is a thoroughly shoddy document, which is unacceptable in its present form. The document is riddled with unsupported assertions. There is no analysis of whether the funds in question have performed in the past and whether they are the most effective way of achieving the objectives or whether those objectives would be better pursued on a European Union or national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document preens itself. It reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"Taken together, these elements offer a clear and coherent vision of the Union as it enters the 21st century."</p></blockquote>
I have read as much as I was able to in the time available and I do not find a clear and coherent vision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enlargement has given us the opportunity to review rather more fundamentally than might otherwise have been the case the future direction of the structural and cohesion funds. The document should address the fundamental objectives of those funds. There should then be an analysis of how best to achieve those objectives, whether by European or national action. There should be a rigorous analysis of the success or otherwise of those programmes to date. Only when they have been demonstrated to be the best way to achieve those objectives should there be a proposal for new programmes or development of the existing programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would be an opportune moment to ask ourselves whether, in view of the enormity of the changes proposed by enlargement—such as the accession of 100 million people to the Union, which will add only 5 per cent. in GDP—such a fundamental change can be accommodated within what is a mere tinkering with the existing system, or whether this is not the moment for a more fundamental review of the issues. I am particularly concerned about the references to sectoral obstacles and market distortions. The Commission document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Making the rules more effective and removing all market distortions and sectoral obstacles will turn Europe into a dynamic and attractive market place."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
One man's comparative advantage may be another man's sectoral obstacle or market distortion. The Germans, I fear, will always view flexible UK labour practices as a market distortion, whereas we quite properly view them as a legitimate advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have previously talked in Standing Committees about taking the public with us as we move forward. The Minister would be wise to take on board that important point. Do the British people understand that the process of enlargement within the framework of changes to the structural and cohesion funds proposed by the Commission means that there will be a substantial reduction in the funds that will come to the UK? Do they understand the scale of transfer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely confused about the stance of Opposition Members' on this issue. If the hon. Gentleman says that he is in favour both of enlargement and of fiscal prudence in not expanding Britain's contribution, how does he square that circle without refocusing and without, at some level, reducing the allocation of funding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members have already mentioned the possibility of raiding the CAP to fund the transitional process. I accept that there are difficulties, but we must review at the level of first principle what we are trying to achieve and whether it can be achieved in the enlarged Community with an additional 100 million people who, in terms of GDP, do not bring much to the party. We must consider whether we can do that by tinkering with the existing structures or whether we need to take more fundamental action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious of the experience in Germany after unification, where the so-called solidarity tax, far from creating cohesion and bringing together the people of east and west Germany, has had quite the opposite effect. It exacerbated tensions between the two halves of Germany. I support enlargement of the Union, but if the British, German, Spanish and Irish peoples come to see that as an unexplained transfer of resources from the EU 15 to the new member states to which they did not sign up, the stress line running down the old iron curtain may be exacerbated.

This has been an interesting debate because of the confusion and misapprehension of Conservative Members and their complete failure to understand the scrutiny process. I do not want to carp—it is good to see Conservative Members present—but there was little Back-Bench presence in the recent debate on the Floor of the House on these important matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is extraordinary about the process is that it shows the schizophrenic divide among Conservative Members on the European issue. They cannot decide whether to back us in our endeavours or to strike out on their own course. Again, I do not want to carp because it is good, and rare for Labour Members, to hear a shadow trade and industry Minister, the hon. Member for Sevenoaks, endorsing some of the policies espoused by the previous Government. However, he made a number of elementary mistakes—one about the scrutiny process—and when he referred to Community initiatives and general objectives and to remarks made by the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), he was basically confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have appalling memories. They speak of the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises and what they would do to support them, but only last week in the	<i>Sunday Times</i>the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) apologised for the failure of the Conservative Party to get it right. Revealingly, she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You will be seeing very little Conservative party policy on this issue in the future."</p></blockquote>
Of course we want more targeting towards small firms and life to be made easier for the voluntary sector. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South raised those important issues. We will be pressing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not, given the shortage of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will be pressing in detail during negotiations next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks made basic mistakes—Opposition Front Benchers really must get their act together—about United Kingdom eligibility. The hon. Gentleman calculated that a quarter of United Kingdom areas will lose their eligibility, but he made many assumptions to reach that figure: the Commission proposals may vary between member states, and the United Kingdom may make a different calculation and may be in a different situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission proposes that the population coverage of the two geographically targeted objectives should represent only 35 per cent. to 40 per cent. of the EU population. That compares with the 51 per cent. covered at present. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks should not make the fundamental error of confusing the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked about cohesion and the Republic of Ireland. The Republic is growing rapidly and should stop receiving support when its gross national product exceeds 90 per cent. of the EU average. For new member states, we expect the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
Commission to insist on compliance with the Maastricht convergence criteria. Clearly, that is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the Commission's intention that eligibility for cohesion funds should require EMU stage three membership. The point is that stage three membership should not rule our cohesion eligibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not because otherwise I shall have no opportunity to respond to the important questions, including some from the hon. Gentleman, that have been asked already. However, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; his remarks were rather kinder to this Government than they use to be to the previous Government. I thank him for his courtesy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention was made by several of my hon. Friends of the 10 per cent. reserve proposed by the Commission. The Government support efforts to make the funds more efficient and to encourage better financial controls. However, we would want to see the Commission's detailed proposals before accepting or rejecting them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for South Thanet and for Stoke-on-Trent, South mentioned the bureaucratic process, and what they said bears consideration. The Conservative party failed abjectly to make headway in that regard. That was graphically illustrated today; the previous Conservative Government did not succeed with our European partners because their Euro-sceptic attitude meant that they were not regarded as being fully part of the European project. They were not listened to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want the Commission to make clear its concerns at the start and not at the end of the process of negotiation. We want there to be a proper partnership in the EU at the local, national level and Europe-wide. That will minimise bureaucracy and render the process as simple as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South made several important points and asked about objective 4. I can confirm that the Government have submitted a plan to the Commission to obtain objective 4 money for training people for work. I know that my hon. Friend has pursued that matter for some time, and I pay tribute to him for it. I am delighted that the matter is being pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) for his question about the CAP. I can tell him that the Commission has suggested a shift of expenditure from production support to rural development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On objective 2, we want to identify areas of need and to aim for areas of suitable size. As I said, we want to do that by using national statistics because frequently they offer more accurate information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for West Dorset did not understand the documents; he has, however, a remarkable record as the author of the poll tax and we should make some allowances. He made some remarks about enlargement. The Governemt believe that countries joining the EU would be in a position similar to that of Greece, which is not in the ERM but which wants eventually to join the single currency. Finally, I refer the hon. Gentleman to page 88 of the documents, which I am not sure that he can have read in detail given the many demands on a busy Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) reminded us of the need to promote both cohesion and growth. I accept that. We want to see a focus on competitiveness and employability. Those will be the hallmarks of our presidency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funds will continue in some form. They meet the aim, as set out in the EC treaty, that the Community should take action to reduce disparities in the levels of development of its various regions and to strengthen economic and social cohesion. Enlargement will result in action aimed at reducing disparities. That will remain necessary, although no country or region should see its receipts from the funds as being permanent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the concerns of my hon. Friends and other Members of the Committee about the future eligibility of individual areas. We shall not know which areas will qualify until the negotiations are complete, probably in late 1998 or early 1999. At this stage, I assure hon. Members that I will take account of their particular concerns as we develop our detailed policies. We are seeking a regime that is fair and affordable, even after EU enlargement. The discussion on the future of the structural funds is starting now. I am grateful for today's debate and I commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
