	<div class='legislation'>Erskine Bridge Tolls Extension Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Erskine Bridge Tolls Extension Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
The Erskine bridge, which stands on the River Clyde nine miles downstream from Glasgow, was built at the request of the Clyde Navigation Trust and Renfrew-shire and Dunbartonshire county councils, the local authorities in the area at the time. The local authorities accepted that the bridge would have to be tolled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Erskine bridge serves as the strategic route for traffic travelling to the north of the River Clyde from the M8 in the east, the M74 in the south and the A77 in the south-west. It provides a high quality and increasingly important link within the trunk road network in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Erskine bridge opened to traffic on 2 July 1971. In its first full year of operation, some 1·9 million vehicles used it. By 1976 the figure was 2·9 million and by 1989, 6·4 million. The average annual growth rate between 1976 and 1989, the latest period for which comparable national figures are available, was 6·8 per cent. That was much higher than the national average of 4 per cent. That high increase has continued and in 1990, 6·85 million vehicles used the bridge. The current national road traffic forecasts suggest that road traffic in Great Britain could increase by 112 per cent. between 1991 and the year 2025. As Strathclyde has a lower average car ownership than the country as a whole, we expect that traffic on the Erskine bridge will continue to increase at a greater rate than the national average as the gap in car ownership narrows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Erskine Bridge Tolls Act 1968 sets the initial tolling period at 20 years. That period ended on 1 July 1991. The Act empowers the Secretary of State for Scotland to set tolls, if he wishes to do so, up to the level which, over the tolling period, would recover the cost of building the bridge and provide for its maintenance over the remainder of its lifetime. That is in line with the principle adopted by successive Governments that the user should pay for the benefits that estuarial crossings provide. That policy has been confirmed in this House on several occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland is not required to set tolls at such a level. It was recognised, even before the bridge was opened in 1971, that it would never be possible at Erskine to recover the full costs of the bridge because of the relatively low levels of traffic, the relatively short distances that traffic would require to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
divert for alternative Clyde crossings and the economic situation of the area served by the bridge. The limited objective was set, therefore, of trying to recover as much as was reasonably possible from tolls while at the same time having regard to the economy of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1968 Act also empowers the Secretary of State to extend the tolling period by periods of five years. He may do that if the full cost of building the bridge and providing for its future maintenance, has not been recovered over the existing tolling period. Because tolls have been set below the cost recovery level, the conditions under which the tolling period may be extended have been met. The Erskine Bridge Tolls Extension Order, which we are debating today, extends the tolling period for a further five years, commencing on 2 July 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The long-term financing of and arrangements for accounting for the Erskine bridge are under consideration. Although the benefits of the bridge are being enjoyed by a growing number of commuters, tourists and businesses, it remains the case that the full cost of building and maintaining the bridge cannot be recovered from tolls revenue. That is because raising the toll to the levels that would be required to allow the bridge to break even would act as a deterrent to the bridge's use. Traffic would be driven away from the bridge and on to the already heavily used Clyde tunnel and Kingston bridge. There would thus continue to be a substantial revenue shortfall at Erskine. But it is right, and in line with successive Governments' policies, that we should continue to recover a contribution to the costs of the bridge from those who benefit from it. Therefore, we decided to extend the tolling period by the five years that the Act allows. We also propose, subject to completion of the separate statutory procedures, to increase toll levels to a flat rate of 60p from 1 April 1992. The required statutory procedures for implementing the increase have already been set in motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed level of toll continues to take full account of the economy of the area. If, for example, we had sought to keep the tolls in line with original level set in 1971, they would now be 98p at today's prices. If we had sought to maximise revenue from tolls, without regard to the economy of the local area, the level of tolls would be between £2 and £3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking, however to impose an increase only from 40p to 60p. We recognise that a steep increase now, 20 years after the opening, to, say, £2 per crossing would be highly disruptive to the patterns of travel and trade that have been established. The increase to 60p will mean that tolls in real terms remain well below the levels originally set in 1971. We do not expect that the toll increase to be applied will result in any significant loss of traffic using the bridge. Our view is supported by an examination of patronage in 1989, the year the tolls were last increased, from 30p to 40p, and the years immediately before and after 1989. There was a steady increase in traffic using the bridge. In 1988 about 5.75 million vehicles crossed. In 1989 the figure was 6.37 million and in 1990, as I have already said it was about 6.85 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By extending the tolling period by means of the order, the Government are maintaining the principle
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
that the user should pay for the benefits that he or she enjoys. It is our intention that toll levels set in the extended period should strike a reasonable balance between recovery of costs and the need to take account of the difficult economic circumstances of the area that the bridge serves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.36 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to intervene in the Minister's speech. His closing remarks were an interesting enunciation of principle and a change of emphasis. He said that the continuation of tolls was based on the user-must-pay principle. The implication is that the Government have abandoned any idea of ending tolls on the Erskine bridge, not only in the immediate future, but in the more distant future. That is a significant change from the approach that has been taken in previous debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister will be well aware, there is a particular reason for the level of interest in the proposals in Scotland. It is 20-odd years since the framework for the tolls was created. At that time, an assurance was given that 20 years of tolls would pay for the bridge and, after that period, the bridge would become part of the public highway. The current interest is because Government are hell bent on building a bridge between Kyleakin and Kyle of Lochalsh. The Skye bridge will not be a low-toll bridge, but a high-toll bridge. The toll will not be 40 or 60p but £4, initially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are promised that the tolls on the Skye bridge will last for 20 years. The precedent that will be established today does not bode well for the fulfillment of that promise. After 20 years, the Government have not said, "The bridge has been paid for so the tolls will cease." Far from it, the Minister has proposed that the toll period be extended and appeared to suggest that the user-must-pay principle will ensure that the tolls go on in perpetuity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I looked up some of the debates that led us to this position. It is interesting, given current circumstances, to see how the debate has evolved. When the Erskine bridge was being built in the late 1960s there was already anxiety in Scotland about the effect of tolls, as both the Forth and Tay bridges had been tolled. I have not done detailed research, but I am sure that the tolls on those bridges were supposed to have a limited lifetime. They are still in place today with no early prospect of their removal. I do not doubt that they will increase, just as the Minister seeks to increase the Erskine bridge toll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a clear feeling that although bridges were marvellous advances for the Scottish economy, tolls were and would increasingly become inhibitions on the benefits to be gained from them. There was considerable opposition in the House in 1968 when these matters were first discussed. I am delighted to note that the Minister who introduced the measures in 1968 was the then hon. Member for Greenock (Dr. Mabon) who later crossed the Dickson-Mabon line and hived off to another organisation, which was extremely welcome to him. It is interesting that one of the arch-critics of tolls
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
on the Erskine bridge was the then hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart, now metamorphosed into the hon. Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor). He was a leading opponent of tolls. Opposition to tolls on the Erskine bridge was a cross-party issue. The then hon. Member for Cathcart found tolls "indefensible". He accused the Labour Government of breaking an election promise not to impose tolls on the Tay and Erskine bridges. He rightly pointed out the additional burdens that tolls placed on the users of the route. From the start, across party lines, people with an awareness of the issue have been worried about the imposition and perpetuation of tolls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We move on 13 years. The last time that the issue was debated in Committee was 9 December 1981. Then, too, the toll was increased. It is interesting when talking about Scottish Tory Members that, politically, they are all long deceased; they are always the ex-Member for somewhere or other. At that time, the former hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Mackay), who, we understand, is to be reincarnated as Lord Mackay of somewhere other than Clashfern, asked about future projections. He told the then Minister, who is now the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind):
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that my hon. Friend will also tell us something about the finances and the projections. While I am the first to accept that it would not be the best use of capital just now to write off these bridges throughout the country, I hope that my hon. Friend will say that, when the economic climate changes and the recession is over, which will happen inevitably, on the list of things the Government might consider doing in the road system"—</p></blockquote>
he was unfortunately interrupted at that point, but went on to say that if a long-term aim of the Government were
	<br><blockquote><p>"to remove the tolls from all the bridges, I, my constituents and all other people who use the Erskine bridge will be grateful." [
	<i>Official Report, Sixth Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments,</i> 9 December 1981; c. 12.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that this week my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Transport finally signalled the joining up of the new bridge at the Dartford crossing. We in the south-east are absolutely delighted to have this new, important link in our road system and are perfectly happy that it has been made possible by its being a tolled bridge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a generous attitude. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us how much people will pay on the new Dartford bridge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am not sure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may return to the Skye analogy, people may not be so delighted if, like the people of Skye, they find out that they will pay £4 a head to cross the bridge. I share their delight briefly, having occasionally witnessed the traffic pressure there, but people may not be so pleased in 20 years' time if the Minister at the time says, "It was all a mistake; the charge was to be for 20 years, but we are going to extend it in perpetuity." We are all in favour of bridges and, to some extent, prepared to tolerate tolls, but these charges, once in place, have a habit of going on and on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monto 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is flying a lot of kites. Does he want the Skye bridge and would he set tolls for it? If not, would a Labour Government—if his party were ever in office—provide the Skye bridge out of public funds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to answer that I do not want a Skye bridge that is provided for by high tolls. I want a Skye bridge that is an extension of the public highway. As the hon. Gentleman well knows, over the past 25 years, since the Ballachulish project was initiated, there has been, on the basis of political consensus, an extremely extensive programme of major bridge building in the highlands and islands. It was always understood that the Skye bridge would be the crowning glory of those projects and there was never any suggestion that a private company would rake in the take at £4 a head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, who is concerned about the well-being of peripheral areas, would agree that just as the people who benefit from the Dornoch, Kylesby and Ballachulish bridges, and all the others that were built in the highlands in that period, are not burdened with tolls, although they were previously burdened with ferry charges, the people of Skye and the outer isles should, in a reasonable society, be treated in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman say where he got the figure of £4 from? I am not aware of any such figure and would not accept such a figure. Is he aware that a concession fare for a car, equivalent to £2.12 per trip, is available to regular users of the ferry? It is the intention that similar concessions should be available to regular users of the new Skye bridge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure of £4 is a modest projection of what the ferry fare will be by the time that the bridge is constructed. If the Minister is giving an assurance that the introductory toll on the Skye bridge, if and when it is opened under private auspices, will be less than £4, I shall be extremely happy to relay that assurance to those who will be most adversely affected by the toll.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should return to the Erskine bridge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister, too, will be relieved to get back to the Erskine bridge. There is a political price to be paid for what the Government are doing in relation to the Skye bridge. There is arguably less of a political price to be paid by putting up the tolls at Erskine from 40p to 60p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spirit of the 1981 debate, with the former hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) pleading for an assurance that the system of tolls would be phased out, was very much in line with the idea that charging people to use these bridges was a finite proposition. At the end of the debate, the right hon. and learned Member for Pentlands did not give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. It was a conciliatory speech in which he held out hope. He said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Finally, I come to the question of the longer term and the implications of any decision to drop tolls altogether. At present, the outstanding debt on the bridges in Scotland is about £50 million. Hon. Gentlemen accept that if there were a move to drop tolls, it could not apply to one or two bridges; it would have to apply to all bridges in the United Kingdom…The present system of tolls on the Erskine bridge was introduced on a 20-year basis. I cannot say today what will be the appropriate policy to pursue when that 20 years expires. That will be for the Government of the day to consider in the light of the circumstances at that time."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman dangled a carrot in that speech. he continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But, given that a time scale was laid down in the original proposals, that is one of the factors that such a Government would wish to consider."—[
	<i>Official Report, Sixth Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments,</i> 9 December 1981, c. 25.]</p></blockquote>
Ten years on, the Government of the day patently did not wish to consider the time scale. The fact that people were told in the late 1960s and early 1970s that the tolls would last for 20 years is of no relevance to the Government. The Minister proposed today not only to extend tolls for another five years, but to increase them by 50 per cent. The simple message of today's proposals, important as they are for the Erskine bridge and other Scottish bridges, is never to believe anyone who says that tolls will last for only 20 years, because once tolls are imposed, they are there for ever and a day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bridges should be seen as improvements to and extensions of the highway. The fact that a road crosses an estuarial water should be neither here nor there. Bridges do not necessarily cost more than some motorways or other constructions, so why are they treated as if they do? It is not even a party political point because hon. Members on both sides of the House have held the view, through all the debates on the matter, that tolls are wrong and that bridges should be treated as extensions of the highway. Labour Governments have also been responsible for introducing or perpetuating tolls on some Scottish bridges. Today's proposals provide a perspective on the debate. After 20 years, tolls are not removed, but continued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee long. My party has never favoured toll bridges, believing that they are an extra and unjustified penalty on communities in Scotland where many crossings must be made over rivers, lochs and estuaries, and to the islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The limit that was imposed on the levy of tolls in the Erskine Bridge Tolls Act 1968 was, as the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) said, a deliberate effort to keep the levy in place for only 20 years and then end it. That was what we all believed at the time. I fail to see a difference between bridges and huge overpasses, such as spaghetti junction in Birmingham, on which no tolls are levied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us how much it has cost to collect the tolls over the years and how much the administration has cost? Is it possible to determine whether there has been a measurable distortion in the numbers of vehicles crossing the bridge? Have commercial goods vehicles avoided the bridge so that they did not have to pay the toll?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask the Minister for help. Obviously, the tolls will continue and his Department will want to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
raise as much money as possible from them. That will mean increasing the traffic over the Erskine bridge. For many years, the tourist board in Argyll has been trying to persuade the Department to erect signs to show people where they could and should go when they cross the Erskine bridge for Glasgow or elsewhere. The primary signs at present are to Loch Lomond, the Trossachs and Greenock. There are no signs to show people that they could make for the Clyde ferries to Dunoon and Rothesay or to welcome visitors to Argyll and the isles. I especially ask the Minister's help in respect of Dunoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. In 1981–82 the Government considered a road equivalent tariff, but decided against it. I want people to cross on the Clyde ferries. The Minister knows of the imminent closure of the United States naval base at Holy loch in the Dunoon and Cowal area. Magnificent efforts have been made by the local enterprise trust and local enterprise companies to attract tourists back to the area. It would be helpful if, at the Erskine bridge crossing, we could show visitors that the area was excellent and worthwhile to visit. will the Minister please help with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.57 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare a number of interests. First, a generous Conservative Government built the drawbridge over the Forth to the gates of my castle. Secondly, as Solicitor-General I undertook the inquiries into the increases in the Forth and Erskine bridges tolls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the Erskine bridge inquiry, I had the good fortune to be conveyed to my next meeting by the local constabulary—in the persons of detectives out of uniform. We were going rather fast as we past uniformed constables waiting in a car at a speed trap. I said, "Slow down chaps, there are your colleagues." They told me not to worry because the force did not have enough money for petrol, so we would not be followed. Why was there not enough money for petrol? Because there are those in the Liberal party who do not believe in taxation, tolls, bridges or anything. Everything is free. That is Alice in Wonderland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are those in the Labour party who have another philosophy. The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) has said that tolls go on and on. Unfortunately, the authorities that run the Forth and Erskine bridges happen to be socialist. On all the inquiries that I undertook, the authorities said that it was their policy to ensure that the toll was never sufficient to pay off the debt, simply to demonstrate the sin of the toll. They advocated expenditure. One sees it
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
if one crosses the Forth bridge, as I do about 10 times a week. They look for any opportunity for expenditure to ensure that the debt always increases, so will never be paid off, and tolls go on for ever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the perpetuation of tolls is a wicked, municipal, socialist plot, why are the Government lying down in front of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the Government are lying down in front of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the evidence and the Committee should know that that was a deliberate policy and described as such at all three inquiries which I conducted. I greatly regret the fact that the Government are not introducing realistic tolls on the Erskine bridge which would pay off the debt in a reasonable time. I do not understand anything about economics, but I understand that if a debt is increased, the interest on it increases and there is a geometrical progression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before that wonderful Forth bridge, thank God, was built, one could cross the river by ferry or train. It cost £7 by ferry in 1960, and £14 with a coffin—sailors are suspicious about the dead. It cost very little to go by train. Now one can cross the Forth for 40p by the bridge, for £1.60 on one of those Noddy trains or for £7 by boat, if one drives down to the coast. It is ridiculous to quibble. What is 60p? A half-pint of beer costs more than that. Look at the tailbacks on the Erskine and Forth bridges. The toll does not appear to be much of a deterrent: one can hardly get on to them. I have to allow two hours for a 15-minute journey to the airport because of the traffic on the Forth bridge. It is fatuous to suggest that tolls are a penalty. They are the price that was agreed—regrettably, the proper price has not been charged—for building the Forth and Erskine bridges which the Government could not at the time afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that Opposition Members feel that money and costs do not matter and that everything should he free. Why do they not provide free beer and whisky? Why not make everything free and charge someone else? Like water and air, why not have everything for free?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will steady the hon. and learned Gentleman for his next rhetorical flourish. Does he think that roads should be free? Just as bridges have, with the march of time and progress, replaced ferries, so great motorways and highways have replaced dirt tracks and horses and carriages. Does he think that roads should be free? If not, what is the essential difference of principle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that roads should be free. I do not object in the slightest to paying for roads every few miles when I drive from Scotland to the south of Italy. It is perfectly reasonable to do that. Roads should not be free. I merely maintain that it is a great advantage to be able to cross the Forth for 40p. I do not smoke, but how much does a packet of cigarettes cost? It is practically 60p a cigarette. A charge of 60p is absolutely nothing. My one regret is that the Government are not introducing a realistic charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Okay. A toll of a fiver would pay off the Forth bridge this year. If, when we introduced decimalisation, we had raised the charge from 116d to 2/6d, there would be no tolls on the Forth bridge, but that was stopped by the socialist administration of the Forth bridge committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an example of Government stupidity that the Clyde tunnel and the Erskine bridge were built almost simultaneously. If there is one thing that is not needed, it is both. If we are to have superfluous construction at vast expenditure, we should charge a toll to pay for it and pay it off quickly. The justification for the toll is that it pays for an advantage that the state, the citizen and the taxpayer could not otherwise afford to provide. If we could have afforded it, the Forth road bridge would have been built 50 years before it was, as would the Erskine bridge. Bridges are especially expensive and people should pay for the great advantage that they in their millions enjoy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much enjoyed the speech of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn). He put a persuasive case that, contrary to what Opposition Members have said, we are not going far enough and that putting only 20p on the toll is a relatively minor measure. He is right, but there are many other crossings available and if we put up the toll too much—my hon. and learned Friend spoke about the charging a fiver, but I understand that the figure for Erskine would be £4—not only would there be a huge outcry, but it would put people off using that crossing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For half an hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, for half an hour—perhaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether there should be a further Forth crossing is under consideration. I know that my hon. and learned Friend is particularly interested in that, but it is far too early to say whether such a crossing will be built and what effect it would have on the existing Forth bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to Argyll, I listened with sympathy to the remarks of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) about signs and I should like to know a little more. There are strict rules—people cannot put up bed-and-breakfast signs on all trunk roads in Britain. If the hon. Lady has particular proposals, it would be useful to have a note of them. I am aware of the effects on tourism of the closure of the United States naval base in the area, and will consider that matter sympathetically if the hon Lady will give me more information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also asked about the costs of administration. The cost of collecting tolls in 1988–89 was £436,278, but the tolls levied in that year amounted to £1.8 million. We estimate that this year the receipt from tolls will be in excess of £2 million. The cost of collection since 1971 has been £4.4 million and the revenue from tolls has been £15.4 million. Those are the figures up to 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend is old enough to remember when the Forth bridge was
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
opened—which he may not be, as he is so youthful—he will recall that we had baskets, as there are in intelligent countries on the continent, into which people threw their 2/- or 1/- piece. The unions objected that the baskets dispensed with those marvellous old salts who used to run the ferries, so the baskets were removed on the wholly spurious excuse that they did not work, which was rubbish. That is why we have spent £4 million unnecessarily, keeping people in retirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend has a point. I saw a toll system for a tunnel to Manhattan which involved people throwing dimes, or whatever the sum was, into a basket. That was then registered electronically on a computer. [Hon. Members: "It works?"] Yes. We shall continue to consider the best and most appropriate methods of collecting tolls. We are considering how to improve the efficiency of toll collection at the Erskine bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), we support the principle that the user should pay for the benefits provided by estuarial crossings. The principle is that tolls should be charged at large estuarial crossings because such crossings involve high provision costs and confer exceptional benefit on users, as my hon. and learned Friend said, by way of large reductions in the lengths and times of journeys. That principle has been reaffirmed many times by successive Governments. However, exceptions have been made where tolls would have caused a substantial diversion of traffic and congestion on untolled routes or where it would cost more to upgrade existing routes than to provide new, toll-free bridges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether the policy would be permanent for the Erskine bridge. The order is for only five years. It would be for Parliament to consider whether to continue it after that time. To abolish all tolls in Britain would be unbelievably expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about Skye. The Government have given a commitment that the Skye bridge will revert to being a toll-free crossing. The New Roads and Street Works Bill does not allow for private developers to charge tolls beyond the periods specified in the relevant toll order. We have given a commitment that there will not be tolls after the end of the concession period and we will honour it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Erskine bridge is different from the Skye bridge. Erskine is a publicly financed toll bridge whereas Skye will be privately financed. The developer must recover his investment or bear the loss. Erskine bridge was built in response to local demand and representations from local authorities, which accepted that tolls should be charged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have strayed on to Skye, I should put the record straight. The original submissions came, not from local authorities but from construction companies. I deplore the fact that the local authority allowed itself to be dragged into the matter, but the impetus for the project did not come from it. The local authorities were not offered a choice between a toll-free bridge at some time in the future and a high-toll
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
private enterprise bridge in the short term. The authorities were placed in an artificial dilemma by the Scottish Office. They had to choose between a high-toll private enterprise bridge in the short term and the threat of no bridge for at least 20 years. The way that the Minister and his advisers have dragged in Highland regional council as a figleaf is disreputable. The initiative did not come from the Highland regional council. I want to pin the Minister down tightly on this point: did he tell the Committee that, if the disgraceful scheme goes ahead in the terms proposed, there are no circumstances under which, tolls could be extended beyond 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are no circumstances in which tolls can be extended beyond the concession period. We will honour that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the Erskine bridge was built in response to local demand. The hon. Gentleman cannot escape the reality that the Erskine bridge was started under a Labour Government. If there had been no local demand, I presume that they would not have gone ahead with the project. If there were no tolls on the Erskine bridge, it would almost certainly not be there today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Erskine bridge plays an increasingly important role in the Scottish trunk road network. It is our policy to toll estuarial crossings to recover building and maintenance costs, on the principle that the benefits should be paid for by those who enjoy them. We cannot, for the reasons that I have given, recover the full costs. We take into account the economic situation of the surrounding area. Our proposals to extend tolling by five
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
years and to increase the tolls to 60p are moderate and in line with our policies. In real terms, tolls will remain below the level originally set in 1971. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to deal with a point raised by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) about the comparative costs of the Erskine bridge and ferry crossings. There is a choice. One can pay 60p to cross at Erskine and then drive 80-odd miles to the Kyle peninsula or one can drive to Gourock and cross on the Caledonian-MacBrayne ferry, which is, fortunately, to remain under sound public ownership. The two journeys would cost roughly the same if a road equivalent tariff was taken into account. On the other hand, Skye is unique. There is no alternative. People will be held to ransom by a private bridge operator.
