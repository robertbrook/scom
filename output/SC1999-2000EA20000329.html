	<div class='legislation'>Aid System for Flax and Hemp</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Ms Joyce Quin)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to be here under your chairmanship, Mrs Michie. I look forward to our debate and welcome it for a number of reasons. The subject is complex, but there are some clear issues at stake relating to the working of support regimes under the common agricultural policy and how they affect different member states. This occasion is timely because the matter has been discussed by the European Commission and in national ministry official circles and it will be subject to political debate at forthcoming meetings of the Council of Ministers, when decisions must be made. It will be helpful to Ministers to have the opportunity of hearing hon. Members' views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Union flax and hemp regime was introduced in 1970 and remains one of the few support regimes to escape significant reform. In recent years, the regime has run into difficulties, partly due to the stimulus to production from the rates of aid. Until the early 1990s, almost all EU flax and hemp was grown in France, Belgium and the Netherlands for the so-called traditional textiles market, which uses long-fibre flax. That market has remained small and static, but the price of the fibre has fluctuated according to fashion and, after 30 years of EU support, the market remains reliant on EU aid for its survival. However, in the early 1990s, interest arose in using the crop for industrial purposes and short-fibre flax is sufficient for that. On a smaller scale, there has been renewed interest in the growing of hemp in the EU, including the United Kingdom. In 1999, the United Kingdom hemp area was around 1,500 hectares, although that figure is likely to increase this year as new markets, particularly in the motor industry, begin to open up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern has been expressed throughout the past decade that short-fibre crops have been grown primarily for the purpose of receiving the generous rates of European aid. To combat the threat of subsidy hunting, the Commission introduced more stringent requirements, such as processing contracts and minimum yields. Those measures have had some success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the United Kingdom, the flax area has fallen in recent years from 20,000 hectares in 1996 to 15,000 hectares in 1999. Production closely reflects demand for the new flax products. However, there has been an explosion of flax growing elsewhere in the European Union, especially in Spain, where the flax area rocketed from a very low level to some 126,000 hectares last year. Regrettably, the image of the European short-fibre flax and hemp industries has suffered as a result of abuse of the regime by some who have grown flax primarily for the aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The Committee will be aware that the Government's policy for United Kingdom agriculture is to secure a more competitive and sustainable industry, responsive to consumer wishes, environmentally responsible and with a much stronger market orientation. Therefore, in general, we support initiatives, and we are often in the vanguard of intiatives, for further reform of the CAP in pursuit of those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I noted in my explanatory memorandum dated 14 December, the Government broadly support the Commission's proposal to bring flax and hemp into the arable area payment scheme. The move to a single area payment accords with our view that growers should make planting decisions in response to the market rather than to the stimuli provided by the CAP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expansion in United Kingdom flax and hemp has been driven by a Government policy to encourage the development of alternative crops. We are interested in flax and hemp because they are environmentally friendly crops. In addition to requiring low levels of chemicals and fertiliser treatments in comparison with mainstream crops such as oilseeds and cereals, they produce renewable raw materials that can displace synthetic fibres derived from petroleum and other mineral resources. The signs are that that is no passing fad. For example, the car industry, especially in Germany, is showing increasing interest in utilising flax and hemp products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flax and hemp have also provided opportunities for some of our farmers to diversify. It is therefore no accident that much of the interest in flax and hemp has arisen in Wales and the south-west of England, where livestock farmers have sought alternative uses for redundant grassland. We support such diversification, provided that markets exist to utilise the crops that are grown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some £7 million has been invested in the UK flax industry, of which more than £500,000 has been funded by the Government and slightly less by the European Union via structural funds, especially the objective 5b programmes. Clearly, we do not wish these investments to be made redundant by measures that are detrimental to UK industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view, the Commission's proposals for reform of the flax and hemp regime are fundamentally flawed and in need of significant amendment. Hon. Members may have noted from my supplementary explanatory memorandum dated 10 February that the Government share the European Scrutiny Committee's view that the Commission's economic justification for different treatment of the long-fibre flax sector and the short-fibre flax and the hemp sector is, to say the least, unconvincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, after 30 years of high-level support, the traditional long-fibre flax sector shows no sign of moving away from its reliance on European Union aid and productivity shows no sign of improving. The Commission's attitude seems to be to shore up a traditional activity in isolation from economic and market realities. On the other hand, it believes that the emergence of the new industrial uses sector of flax and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
hemp is largely opportunistic and not worthy of support. We believe, however, that the two sectors should be treated the same and should attract the same levels of European Union aid, which should be reduced in parallel over the medium term until it matches that available for other arable area crops. The Government therefore oppose the discrimination between long and short-fibre crops contained in the Commission's reform proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to explain the Government's position on a number of other points, some already raised by the Scrutiny Committee in response to the explanatory memoranda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is the key point of land eligibility, which has been raised in briefings by the National Farmers Union and others. I hope that the members of the Committee have seen by now the draft regulatory impact assessment of the reform proposals. It makes it clear that the proposals are likely to discriminate against the United Kingdom flax and hemp industries, for both growers and processors. About 95 per cent. of UK flax and 85 per cent. of UK hemp is grown on land ineligible for arable area payments. Without some concession on the question of land eligibility, those crops would be likely to disappear, leaving processors with no domestic supply of raw materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considered carefully how best to deal with the problem. The Commission has acknowledged that it needs a solution. One possibility would be to seek the reclassification of land on which flax and hemp have been grown in recent years to become eligible for area payments. The problem with that approach is that there would be no guarantee that flax and hemp would continue to be grown, rather that other eligible crops such as cereals, unless eligibility were to be confined to flax and hemp.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem with that approach is that the door would be closed to new growers, preventing the industry from expanding should the market so allow. That would affect areas that have experienced expansion in recent years, such as Wales and the southwest of England. A third problem would be the likelihood of increased base area penalties under the arable area payments scheme, which could reduce returns to growers across the arable sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, therefore, suggested an alternative two-pronged approach to the Commission that aims to avoid those problems. First, we have suggested that arable base areas should be adjusted by taking the average area on which flax and hemp were grown between 1997 and 1999, rather than between 1989 and 1991 as proposed by the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we have suggested that the land eligibility rules should be disregarded for flax and hemp, so that any land could be used for those crops. With that approach, expansion would still be constrained by base area limitations, but the suggested approach for their adjustment would allow production to continue at least up to current levels without triggering base area penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timing of the reform is an issue that we and other interested parties have raised. The proposals envisage
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the reform applying with effect from the 2000–01 marketing year for arable crops, which would include flax and hemp crops to be grown this year and planted during the current planting season. The final paragraph of the Commission's explanatory memorandum covering the proposals stated that a Council decision on the reform would have to be reached no later than the beginning of March in order to be implemented in time for the 2000–01 marketing year. As this deadline has now passed, it is too late for the reforms, if agreed, to apply to this year's crops. That has caused anxiety among UK growers, who need to know whether crops that they sow this year on land ineligible for arable payments will qualify for aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have argued that, in the absence of a decision from the Council, the existing regime rules must still apply. We have received oral advice that growers who plant on what might be designated ineligible land under the Commission's proposals would have a legitimate expectation of receiving aid in relation to those crops this year, regardless of the outcome of the reform. However, the Commission has not put that in writing, and that omission forms part of our representations to seek clarification and to bring certainty to our growers. We have passed on the oral advice to growers' representatives and to flax and hemp processors. The Committee may find that a frustrating way of proceeding, but it is not unusual in discussions on reform proposals in the Commission. The Committee will be aware of recently proposed changes relating to hedges and it took a long time to obtain the clarification for our farmers in the current year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have questioned the lack of proposals for flax and hemp aid in this year's price-fixing proposals. It seems most unlikely that reform could be agreed by the Agriculture Council before the arable area payments scheme deadline for applications on 15 May and, even if it were, detailed Commission regulations would have to be agreed before new arrangements could come into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another concern about the effect of the flax and hemp reform proposals is the added complexity that they would bring to the regime. The initiative to bring flax and hemp into the general arable regime is a step towards simplification, but the proposals for a new tonnage-based processing aid would create a whole new tier of support with new problems of administration and control. In effect, the commission is proposing to replace one area-based support mechanism with three, because, in addition to area-based support for growers, different processing aid arrangements are proposed for long-fibre flax, short-fibre flax and hemp. That goes against the Agriculture Commissioner's views on simplification of the CAP which he and others, including ourselves, have expressed continually in recent months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would like discrimination between the sectors to be removed. We are sceptical about the need for separate processing aid, but, if it is to be established, the rates of aid available to the two sectors should be unified and both should be phased out in the medium term. We also have reservations about the proposal for national guaranteed quantities, which would make it difficult for new factories that are being developed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0694">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
operate successfully. The proposals for processing aid and the national guaranteed quantities system are riddled with technical difficulties. For example, processors will need to achieve production of fibres with less than 5 per cent. impurities to qualify for the aid. That high level of purity is not necessary for all industrial applications of flax and hemp, so is not justified. Other problems include the transfer of fibres from one member state for processing in another and the lack of definition of what constitutes long-fibre and short-fibre production. The majority of member states, including the United Kingdom, would prefer any processing aid to be area-based, not tonnage based. I am pleased that the Portuguese Presidency has agreed to put together a paper for future discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals contain new restrictions on the growing of hemp. They are largely inspired by a United Nations initiative on drug production and control. The Commission is concerned about the image of the common agricultural policy. It understands the need to increase the minimum level of checking of EU hemp crops and to require member states to implement a system of prior authorisation for the growing of hemp. However, the new measures appear to be excessive, because there have been no reports of drug varieties of hemp being grown among European Union-supported hemp crops. The United Kingdom already has stringent controls on the growing of hemp, including prior authorisation through a licensing system administered by the Home Office. The new measures should not lead to significant problems for us, but we would be concerned if they changed an effective system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals envisage the compulsory denaturing of hemp seeds, other than seeds for sowing, imported from outside the European Union. The Committee may have noted from the draft regulatory impact assessment that there is a small United Kingdom industry which uses hemp seed in the manufacture of foodstuffs, non-prescription medicines and cosmetics. Most of the seed used by that industry is sourced from within the European Union, but some is obtained from third countries. That supply would be effectively blocked, as the denaturing process destroys the seed's essential properties, thus making it unusable. We have questioned whether there is a need for this further regulation in the absence of evidence that a loophole exists that needs to be plugged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will find it helpful if I give a brief update on the negotiations for this proposed reform. As I said, the proposals have yet to progress beyond discussions at official level. There have been five Council working groups, and the reform has been discussed twice at the special committee for agriculture. Much of the discussion to date has been about the technical details of the proposals, but the fundamental points of concern cannot begin to be addressed until the matter goes to the Agriculture Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth pointing out that we are far from alone in having reservations—in our case strong reservations—about the proposals. Indeed, almost all member states have voiced criticism. Even those with traditional long-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
fibre flax industries are unhappy. For example, Francehas a substantial hemp industry that may be jeopardised by the proposed reform. Member states which, like the UK, have emerging industries in the industrial fibres sector—Germany, Finland, Austria and Denmark—share our concerns that the proposals could damage the industry before it has had time to become fully established. Non-growing member states are also unhappy, because the national guaranteed quality arrangements would prevent them from moving into flax and hemp production in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that the reform will appear on the agenda for the May Agriculture Council, but that will depend partly on progress with the Presidency's paper on area-based processing aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Paliament is due to give its opinion on the reform proposals in April. We have seen a working document in which the Parliament gives a provisional view of the proposals. The initial reaction of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is that the proposals should be rejected in their present form on the grounds that they would not meet the Commission's stated objectives and would create problems for different parts of the sector. We await the Parliament's full opinion with considerable interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there is a long way to go before agreement can be reached on the future of flax and hemp support. The Government support further reform of the CAP and see no reason why flax and hemp should be exempt from that, but believe that the proposals are deficient in the ways that I have described. Our aim is to pursue reform of the sector, while ensuring that the framework of support does not threaten the viability of the UK flax and hemp industry or adversely and unfairly discriminate against us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the questions and discussion in the Committee, but I hope that members of the Committee will feel able to support the Government's strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can understand why there is a need to review the regime, given that the subsidy went up 84 million euros in four years, an increase of 113 per cent. As the Minister rightly said, a large part of that increase arose from the subsidies paid to Spanish growers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of new evidence, despite all the fires, the fraud and the goings on in Spain, there is likely to be a massive reduction in the harvest this year, does the Minister think that the proposals from the Council and the Commission are completely inappropriate and will she reject them in their entirety?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to refer to the recent reduction in the crops in Spain and the controls that have been put in place to deal with some of the abuses that undoubtedly occurred. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is also right to say that part of the Commission's porposal is aimed at solving a problem
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0695">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
that has certainly diminished, if not disappeared. Ministers will also make that point strongly in the political discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether we would throw out the reforms in their entirety. Given that the Government do not have a fundamental objection to changes in flax and hemp production, or to bringing such crops into the overall arable area system, I will not go so far as to say that we will throw out the reforms in their entirety. However, we have so many reservations that the reforms are unacceptable in their present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks a good question. Some aspects of our proposals have received a lot of support from other member states. In my opening statement, I listed some of the member states that have strong reservations, particularly about the discrimination between short and long fibres. Obviously, we are supported by countries that, like ourselves, have in reent years grown flax and hemp for industrial use. However, the UK is in a unique position as regards eligible areas, and the Commission seems to understand that we will require recognition of that. As I said, our hard-pressed livestock farmers have considered growing flax and hemp in areas that were previously grassland, in order to diversify. The information from the Commission shows that we are in a unique position, which is why we have to fight a specific battle on land eligibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission was considering 12,000 tonnes maximum guaranteed quantities for the UK. That seems to suggest that it contemplates our continuing to produce some flax and hemp. However, if its proposal on land eligibility were adopted in its current form, most of that production would disappear, so there is even inconsistency in the Commission's own proposals. We can use that to our advantage in negotiations. As I said, there is an understanding that we are in a unique position. However, the Committee will understand that it is not ideal for us to have a unique interest to try to preserve in negotiations. That will not be easy, although to date the Commission has shown that it appreciates our position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: By how much would the prices of long and short-fibre products have to fall to be viable without any subsidy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I can produce a figure off the top of my head. Our regulatory impact assessment says that production would not be viable without aid from the European Union. The investments that have been made would have been impossible if an aid system had not existed. However, we are discussing relatively new uses for the products. The CAP is a system of high subsidies, but at least this subsidy is linked to our aim of environmental sustainability and is operating in a market that could expand, unlike the rather static market for traditional long-fibre flax and hemp. If subsidies were not available at present, production
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
would not continue because it would not be viable. Assuming that we reach agreement on how to progress in the short term, I presume that the Commission will monitor the growth of industrial sector uses of flax and hemp in the next few years and draw conclusions about the future level of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows that the Government's policy, like the previous Government's, is to move away from such agricultural subsidies. I suppose, however, that the honest answer to his question is that many sectors of the agricultural industry would find it difficult to be viable without the subsidy regimes in the common agricultural policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the Minister's thoughts on the impact that the measures would have on the flax and hemp processors in this country? As I understand it, they rely heavily on domestic production. There will be no option for importation, because the cost of transporting the raw materials is relatively high. Could the industry vanish? Should we support the Commission's proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of those involved in the industry, especially in processing, will not be able to continue to process the products if we cannot make any progress, at least on the eligible areas part of the proposal. If we make progress on that, the effect on both processing and production in the industry will be limited. Most producers would want to continue, despite the reductions in aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have answered my hon. Friend's question in some detail in the regulatory impact assessment, which we have published and given to Committee members. That considers the effect on farmers and processors. Producers could transfer to another form of production, so the proposals may not put them out of business. As for processors, some of the new, more specialised facilities probably would not continue, and there may be three of four of those. Many processors who have processed the products for some time, however, are also grain merchants, or are involved in other economic activities. That makes it unlikely that these measures alone will cause them to go out of business, although they could cause them to concentrate more on those other activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was the Commission's motivation in making the proposals primarily the need for budgetary control, or was it World Trade Organisation compatibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission is primarily motivated by the need for budgetary control, and by an understandable desire to combat some of the abuses of the system that we have seen during the past couple of years. Its concerns with budgetary considerations explain why it has been considering several other areas of expenditure, in which hon. Members on both sides of the House have taken an interest. Export refunds and other costly parts of the common agricultural policy are among those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the proposals in the memorandum, and to the discrimination between long and short fibres. I was pleased when the Minister said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
that the Council's arguments were unconvincing, because that is also our view. There is no definition of "short" and "long" in the memorandum. Does she agree that, until there is such a definition, it is pointless to differentiate in the way that is proposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. There is clearly a distinction between traditional long-fibre production for textiles, and the more recent short-fibre production for industrial use. None the less, there should be a proper definition if we are to proceed convincingly. If there is not a convincing definition, the way is left open to further exploitation of the system, which is presumably what the Commission is trying to avoid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been informed that when the market for long fibre is under pressure, the producers simply cut it and sell it as short fibre. How can we prevent that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I was hinting at in my previous answer. If the definition is not clear, the growers have an incentive to use the system to their maximum advantage, and sometimes against the spirit of the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government think that the arable area payments scheme, with its set-aside provisions, is an appropriate vehicle to support the growing of non-food crops?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the whole, I think that it is—that is certainly true of the sector that we are discussing. The area system was introduced as an early attempt to reform the common agricultural policy; it is simpler and has the potential to be more WTO-compatible than other approaches, and therefore fits in with the Government's reform agenda. Obviously, however, the Government's long-term strategy is to move away from the subsidy system altogether, and to have an agricultural policy that is geared much more to the market. Under that strategy, payments would be made only with regard to agreed goals, whether those were environmental or related to rural development or diversification. That would be the best way for us to operate. For that reason, we are not averse to the introduction of the flax and hemp regime into the arable area payments scheme and subsidy system. However, we would not want that to be done in a way that was discriminatory or that uniquely disadvantaged this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If these products are included in the arable area payments scheme, will the money be taken from one pot, or will the pot's size increase? Will those who currently receive arable aid have that aid reduced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Other recipients of the arable area payments scheme will not have their aid reduced unless there is an expansion beyond the base area system, which means that penalties have to be applied across the board to all growers who receive arable payments. The rates for each crop are established, and there is no direct correlation between increasing aid for flax and hemp and reducing it for cereals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The relevant documentation for our sitting includes a regulatory impact assessment, paragraphs 21 and 22 of which detail the compliance costs for typical businesses. They state that a typical flax farmer would probably face an annual loss in income of about £8,047 a year, but that a hemp farmer would face a loss in income of about £6,202. What proportion of a business would that involve? Does the Minister have that information to hand? Perhaps she will receive an inspired opinion on the matter from somewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Inspiration has not yet struck. In view of the fairly low numbers of flax and hemp producers, I imagine that it is easier to establish the relevant figures for a typical farmer. However, the fact that those farmers have other production possibilities makes the situation rather less typical. It is hard for me to give my hon. Friend a simple answer. The estimates in the regulatory impact assessment were based on the number of people who currently produce the crop. The overall effect on people's income depends on many other factors—for example, whether they grow other crops and the nature of the other activities in which they are involved. In that context, it is more difficult to answer my hon. Friend's question. If I can obtain further information on this matter, I should be more than happy to write to Committee members about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What alternative activities could flax processors go into? It is virtually unique to subsidise the processors of an agricultural crop. What potential markets do they have downstream?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said in response to an earlier question from the hon. Gentleman that some of the processors are agricultural grain merchants. They are therefore already involved in other activities. I am aware of a couple of facilities that are seeking to specialise in flax and hemp. Processors need to decide whether it is worth while continuing to invest in such facilities or whether they should develop an alternative. They will have to take that decision. Typically, the people who are already involved in the system also work as agricultural grain merchants. They are rural area industries, which is an important factor to bear in mind at the present time, given the crisis in agriculture in the countryside. Such firms and organisations would be well advised to refer to the Government's rural development regulations, which signalled good candidates for future diversification in agricultural activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some firms already have alternative activities and need only diversify in part of their operations. If subsidies were to be removed completely, how many would go to the wall and how many would survive by developing other activities that they already have in hand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for me to say without a complete understanding of the financial circumstances of all such operations. Firms that have traditionally been involved in other areas of activity, and have not specialised, would obviously be in a much better position. I understand that only a couple of facilities specialise purely and simply in flax and hemp.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked an earlier question about the viability of the sector without subsidy. It is important for those who are involved in it to address
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0697">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
that issue. There are potential and actual industrial outlets for the product. Any firm that is involved on the processing side should have serious discussions with potential users, especially in the motor industry, which will, to some extent, use these products instead of synthetic alternatives in future. Many economic factors are involved. A topical example, is the price of petroleum, which is a factor in competing synthetic products. Firms and investors must consider many economic decisions that are outside the narrow remit of the European Commission's proposals on flax and hemp. Organisations need to research the potential market and assess whether it can be viable without aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 12992/99, a draft Council Regulation on the reform of the flax and hemp support regime; and supports the Government's aim of promoting reform of this sector, whilst ensuring that the changes to the regime do not prejudice the future viability of the UK industry.—[
	<i>Ms Quin.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>11.18 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members are encouraged by the Minister's opening remarks and responses to hon. Members' questions. She used the words "fundamentally flawed" regarding the regulation, and we entirely concur with that analysis. We would reject it, because, although it contains a few snippets of sensible proposals, it starts from the wrong point and is based on false premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is especially true of the premise that there will be a continuing and escalating growth in subsidy because of subsidy hunting by certain countries, principally Spain. I know that the Minister finds it difficult to say that, but there is good evidence that it is the real cause of the problem. The Commission's fraud busters went to Spain to investigate the matter, resignations ensued, and unusual fires have been seen during the past year burning off a crop that was never sent for processing. It seems that the policing that should have been there to start with has now been firmly put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That problem has probably largely disappeared. The Commission will know whether that is so later in the year, when the crop is harvested in Spain. The seed purchased and used in Spain for the current crop suggest a phenomenal decrease in the crop's acreage. On that basis, many of the memorandum's proposals are completely unnecessary. They appear to discriminate much more against producers of flax and hemp in this country, as opposed to the traditional producers. The memorandum seemed to be written with the support of the traditional producers—France, the Netherlands and Belgium—which are trying to protect their staple long-fibre industry at the expense of other producers. Such producers are mainly of the short-fibre variety, which forms the basis of the business in this country. That appears to be blatant protectionism, which is biased against British farmers. Furthermore, short-fibre production supplies the raw ingredients for a number of innovative and
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
environmentally friendly industrial materials. British farmers have worked with industrial users to create a new market, which will be badly compromised by the current proposals. That will endanger about £1 million of public investment—and £2 million to £3 million of private investment—in processing, especially of short fibre, for the new markets outlined by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for British producers that a decision is made quickly on what is likely to happen prior to seeding this year's crop. Massive uncertainty exists, to which the Minister alluded. We are grateful that she is pressing for a decision and we encourage her in that. The state of agriculture—especially the problems faced by traditional hill farmers and the livestock industry—has led people to turn to this alternative crop and they need every encouragement. An early decision on the implementation date, or a decision not to proceed with the memorandum as suggested, would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased with the Minister's comments on the proposals to bring flax and hemp into the arable area payments scheme. I am not an expert on such matters and do not know whether the Government's suggestions will be acceptable. However, the proposals are unacceptable and would probably wipe out the industry in Britain at a stroke. We encourage the Minister to press for change and especially to obtain acceptance for her Department's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned in one of my questions the problems of differentiating between long and short fibres. The market depends on all sorts of variables, such as the fashion for linen. When the market is low, it is not unknown for long fibre to be cut and sold as short fibre. That should be tackled—it should probably be thrown out in its entirety. On the need for processing aid, it would make the scheme more complicated. Farmers in this country would like payments on an area basis to continue. The Minister seemed to agree with that idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are encouraged by the Minister's comments. She has covered the areas of concern that we have identified in the draft regulation. There remain several battles for her to fight, and we wish her well in fighting them. She needs encouragement from other nation states that also believe that the proposals discriminate against them. However, they appear to discriminate especially against British producers because the whole crop is grown on ineligible areas. That is a critical point in that the proposed system discriminates entirely against the British producer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition would reject the proposal in its entirety, although that may not be possible. However, it certainly needs to be completely rewritten, and we wish the Minister good fortune in her attempt to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.25 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo many of the points made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss). The Minister has given a very good account of the difficulties that the proposals would produce, and I support the Government's intention to fight them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals appear to contain three fundamental problems. The first is that they are badly constructed;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0698">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
the second is their parochial view of Britain and its effect on our domestic industries; the third, and most important, is that they do not take into account the changing face of agriculture both in Britain and in Europe in the wider sense. They take no account of the new markets that will have to be developed to maintain a viable agricultural industry, or the new uses that will have to be found, on the grounds of sustainability if nothing else, for non-food produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed in the newspapers today that the Ministry was changing its objective, by changing the term "food" to "farm produce" to reflect the changes associated with the Food Standards Agency. The focus of the entire industry is having to change from simply identifying food as its primary objective. It must now consider the broader issue of what can be produced on our farms in a sustainable form that can be of value to the wider community. That will encompass many new applications that will go well beyond the subject of our discussions today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flax and hemp production is an important fledgling industry, especially in my part of the world, the southwest, where there is a concentration of growth. There are many other new crops—withy for fuel, for example, and elephant grass—the cultivation of which will have to be addressed in the CAP. The policy needs to be massively reformed, and it needs to take into account the environmental issues rather than simply reducing opportunities. It is important to get this regulation right because of the message that it will send.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one wants subsidy-driven production. The Minister said that the Commission's prime motivation was not WTO-compatibility but budgetary control. We have already heard about the difficulties in Spain. The position there has altered markedly in the past year, so the Commission may be attempting to address a problem that no longer exists. However, even if it does, I suggest that this is not the right way of addressing it. I am sure that the Committee will agree with that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister correctly addressed the discrimination between long and short-fibre hemp. There is no argument for making such a distinction. The Commission has produced no credible intellectual or economic reasons why there should be such a differentiation. I should be just as worried if there were discrimination the other way—if the long-fibre producers in the traditional growing areas of France and the low countries were to impose a barrier to using their produce in industrial applications simply because of that discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have concerns about bringing a non-food product into the arable area payments scheme. It does not sit well with the objective of set-aside. I dislike set-aside anyway but there is an imbalance there. It will mean that there will have to be increasingly artificial definitions of integrated administration and control system eligibility areas. The Minister has proposed that as one way in which the Commission could deal with this issue. It would put a cap on our production areas, which I am not sure is sensible. As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, we are dealing with an industy that has grown up in response to an agricultural crisis, and enables hard-pressed livestock
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
farmers in the west country who cannot survive in any other way to diversify and find new produce, principally on lowland areas that fall outside identified arable areas. It would be a great shame if that flexibility were removed from farmers who need that assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem with limitation would be on the national guaranteed quantities, and I am not sure how that system would work. How could fossilisation of the industry be prevented, as a result of which, irrespective of demand, it could not grow, simply because of the application?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second major point is about the timetable. It is not acceptable that we cannot get a sensible reply out of the Commission about this year's harvest—the seed is in the ground. I applaud the Minister for what she has managed to do on hedges, but what a long time it took to persuade the Commission to take a perfectly sensible position. The Commission must sharpen up its act on such issues, because people's livelihoods are at stake. The consequences of delay are often very damaging. In the case of the hedgerows, people grubbed up their hedges because of a threat that did not materialise, and that is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced that processing aid is the right way to achieve the long-term future of these industries. A short-term measure might be better. I believe that on this issue it is better to let sleeping dogs lie, because there is no particular merit in this reform of the overall CAP in isolation and separate from all the other measures that need to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission is fussing needlessly, about hemp, because there is no evidence of abuse of the present system. The same Commission is happy for substantial payments to be made to tobacco growers for producing their particular drug: Hemp is an industrial fibre that has no drug use, but even though no abuse has been shown, it is fussing about a spin-off that it has not yet identified and which it is addressing as an issue. That, again, seems wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is that there is something fundamentally wrong with the process. As the Minister has described, technical discussions can take place over a significant period of time that put the viability of industries across Europe at stake, and at no time is there an opportunity early in the process for a political view to be taken on the principles of what is being discussed. That is a fundamental flaw in the Brussels and Strasbourg processes. The matter may not have come before the Council of Ministers because there was not a detailed proposal to put before it, but the European Parliament at least should have been involved at an early stage. That would have allowed the special committee for agriculture to do what the Minister said that it had done, namely to say, "This is not a sensible way forward for the Commission. We need to redirect its attentions elsewhere or consider alternative proposals." If we had taken that approach, much misery would have been spared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister wins this battle—we have a long way to go, and great damage could be done to a small but important industry, especially in my region. I wish the Minister well. We shall support the motion,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0699">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to speak in this debate. I feel partly responsible for it, because I have the honour of sitting on the Select Committee on European Scrutiny and I was keen for the issue to be discussed. It is also a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am amazed at how much of a consensus we have achieved this morning. That does not always happen—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could well be a first. The hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis) does not usually agree with me. However, our debate has not finished, and there is still time for him to disagree with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent an agricultural constituency and regard this issue as a classic case in which state subsidies have been spent in a silly way—I shall enlarge on that presently. That approach can also distort future diversification, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members may need reminding of the amount of money that this country is spending. According to the 1998 White Paper on European Community Finances, we contributed £8.712 billion to the European Community and we received back £4.115 billion, making our net contribution £4.597 billion. For every pound we got back, we sent out £2.12 at a time when ordinary finances were strained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Library, 45 per cent. of European Community spending is on agriculture. That gives European agriculture a bad name at a time when it must break into new areas and react to the more significant worldwide reductions in subsidies and to pressures from the World Trade Organisation. In view of the situation, the Minister was very polite about the disaster in the flax industry, which does not help the diversification drive in agriculture. If the agricultural sector depends on subsidies, it will get a black name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put a few figures on the record. Brutally, if people are offered a subsidy of £500 an acre to produce something that may of may not be wanted, given the crisis in marginal areas, they will grab the subsidy. There have been astonishing increases in such subsidies. A paper that the European Scrutiny Committee examined states that the overall figures have risen from 70,000 hectares to 208,000 hectares. The figures for Spain rose from 187 hectares in 1993 to 126,000 hectares in 1999, and the figures for this country rose from 2,181 hectares to 15,000 hectares. Why? Because the money is there. The associated sums rose from 74 million euros in 1995, which today converts to £45 million, to 158 million euros in 1999, which converts to £96 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was very polite—she did not point out that the real cause of the scandal was spectacular
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
corruption in Spain. She could have made a cheap political point, which I shall make for her. The leading light in this context has been described as
	<br><blockquote><p>a pale, austere, Castilian aristocrat—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty: 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> Is that the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not my right hon. Friend, who is pale, austere or an aristocrat, although he might be Castilian. The person in question is a lady called Loyola de Palacio del Valle Lersundi was the conservative agriculture Minister in Spain at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The depth of the corruption is staggering. One of Miss de Palacio's officials, Nicolas Lopez de Coca, was supposed to have raked in £1.3 million in EU flax subsidies. Alejandro Alonso Nunez, head of agriculture in Castilla-La Mancha, was the brave man who blew the whistle on the case. He asked, "Where is all this flax? Where is the great mountain, this Everest of flax? It must be somewhere, but no one has ever seen it." When the report was produced, it stated that 80 per cent. of Spain's total flax crop had disappeared, some of it having supposedly been burnt in a rash of unfortunate barnyard fires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scandal was jumped on and has been reduced. Spain's production will fall, but we are penalising our small industry, which may have a chance to get off the ground. It is unfair that we are being limited to 12,100 tonnes, but Spain is doing well and being rewarded with 18,700 tonnes. Will the Minister comment on the possibility of making those quotas more fair during the negotiations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prospects for making the industry viable are bleak without subsidies. The Minister was honest and said that she could not tell us at what rate prices would have to fall to make them viable and she did not know how many processes would continue. Some already involve animal feedstuffs, so the chance of diversifying is good. We have discussed the car industry and in one of the memos we came across a figure that suggests that the price of flax and hemp and other recyclable raw materials are generally 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. higher than current mineral fibres, so there would have to be a big jump at the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries negotiations—that did not happen yesterday—for the products to compete. The position looks bleak.

In this country there has been bad environmental damage. Justin Harmer near Lewes ploughed up 250 acres of environmentally sensitive grassland because he could obtain £330 an acre for growing flax instead of £14 an acre for a Government scheme. The land would have qualified as a site of special scientific interest and the local English Nature office stated that although it was not a top-quality grassland SSSI, it was appalling that he was allowed to do that. There was little that English Nature could do. It offered him money, but he seemed dead set on doing it anyway. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome made the point that many people in agriculture are in a marginal situation and if subsidies are offered, they cannot be blamed for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0700">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
grabbing them. Another man, Mr. David Robinson, chose in 1997 to plant flax on land on which wild flowers were growing to grab the subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be the possibility of a fledgling industry here. I am not convinced of that, and the figures for getting it off the ground seem overwhelming. My fear is that the measure will blacken the name of state spending and pervert the direction of developments by people who want to diversify on marginal land. I support the Minister in her opposition to the measure. It should be blocked because it is aimed at a scandal in Spain that may now have passed and it will clobber our industry. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, the timetable is vital. The National Farmers Union stated in a letter that if the March deadline is missed, there must be an absolutely clear timetable. There must be a clear explanation of why long-fibre flax is being given beneficial treatment over short-fibre flax when there is an easy option of using a pair of scissors. The hon. Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) shakes his head, but it is easy to reduce long fibre to short fibre by mowing it at a different length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have clarification as to whether English land can be reclassified. I understand that 95 per cent. of current flax-growing land is currently ineligible. Given that some of the more sensible countries share our view—the Minister named Germany, Finland, Austria and Denmark—does qualified majority voting offer a chance of blocking the measure? I cannot see any advantage to our national interest in letting it pass as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate, and I welcome the fact that there has been such strong support for what the Government are seeking to achieve through the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, who has given me his apologies for his unavoidable departure, asked several questions that were echoed by the hon. Members for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) and for Somerton and Frome. In respect of what happened in Spain, I point out to the hon. Member for North Shropshire that that received massive publicity a few months ago, and it has been very publicly aired. It was also much debated in the European Parliament and raised in several national Parliaments. There were many allegations about the involvement of top officials in the ministry and how much they knew about the improper—to put it mildly—growing of flax and hemp. In response to one of the points that was made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, our information is that the Spanish crop this year has indeed been greatly reduced. It has fallen from 126,000 hectares to about 40,000 hectares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not surprisingly, hon. Members stressed the importance of ensuring that the Commission has a much better process of decision-making on such issues, and I agree with that. However, it is worth pointing out that the common agricultural policy, perhaps because it is so complex and comprehensive, was particularly compromised by the delays that were caused by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
resignation of the former European Commission and the establishment of the subsequent Commission. That meant that many technical decisions that ultimately needed political approval, or approval at the top level of the Commission, were held up for a considerable period of time. I am sure that we all welcomed the appointment of the new Commission and support the measures that Commissioner Kinnock is putting in place in terms of the reform agenda. However, in many policy areas, the delays—which have been an inherent part of the system for a long time—have been even more exaggerated. I assure the Committee that we will tackle the problem in every way possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome referred to hedges. I do not want to digress on to that subject, other than to point out that even what was proposed in the clarification to the Commission provided no justification for grubbing up hedges. Trimming hedges is one thing, but grubbing them up is quite another. It was completely unjustified, and anyone who did so was wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the points that were raised by the hon. Member for North Shropshire, in many respects the Government are taking the action that he wants. We have asked for some flexibility with regard to base areas and guaranteed quantities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some questions related to the difficulty of differentiating long and short fibres. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire returned to the point about the absence of a definition. The Government have repeatedly pressed for definition in the proposed regulation. Clarity is necessary before any proposal is agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also mentioned hill farmers. I should make it clear that flax and hemp are not grown, and should not be grown, in hill areas. They are of interest to livestock producers in lowland areas. That point should be emphasised. All hon. Members referred to the discrimination against UK producers. I appreciate those points. However, I repeat that our short-fibre and industrial producers are not alone—Germany, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark are all affected. Indeed, member states that do not grow flax and hemp could also be affected by the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked again whether the European Commission regards the matter in budgetary terms. It does. However, I would make a distinction—which was not made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome—between cuts to reduce the cost of the agricultural budget, which is one aim, and budgetary control measures, which are designed to control fraud and abuse. Both are important elements in the equation, as long as we do not attack a disappearing problem, as the hon. Member for North Shropshire pointed out. We do not want to introduce a regulation that deals with a problem that no longer exists or has largely disappeared. Committee members seem to feel strongly about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for North Shropshire and for Somerton and Frome raised important environmental questions. As the hon. Member for North Shropshire
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0701">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
pointed out, there have been examples of the crop being grown in inappropriate areas, even in Britain. Fortunately, that seems to have been tackled by the environmental protocol, which was devised for the flax processors, with the approval of environmental bodies, to ensure that environmentally sensitive land was not used for growing flax and hemp. That scheme has worked well, although I assure the Committee that close monitoring of the issue will continue. We feel strongly that the existence of a European Union substitute should not run counter to our environmental objectives or environmental regulations and schemes in our country. We want to prevent the ploughing up of land of conservation value in order to grow such crops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The critical point, which has been mentioned repeatedly, relates to eligible areas. The comments made by Committee members have reinforced my view on that. It is true that 95 per cent. of flax and 85 per cent. of hemp were grown in what would be described, under the proposal, as ineligible areas. The hon. Member for North Shropshire asked about blocking the proposals. We will need to reach an understanding with the Commission on the parts of the proposals that relate to eligible areas, which are of unique relevant to the UK. Nevertheless, we are in a good position to block the overall proposals if necessary. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the countries that I have mentioned, which have similar interests to our own, would constitute a blocking minority—two large countries and three or four small countries. In any case, most countries, even traditional long-fibre flax producers, have expressed
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
reservations about different parts of the Commission proposals. However, we are not against the Commission seeking to reduce the cost of the CAP. It has a responsibility to examine the cost in all areas of production, as the hon. Member for North Shropshire pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is backward looking, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome mentioned. In many ways, it repeats some of the worst features of the traditional CAP support mechanisms. Instead of looking forward, it fossilises and adds complexity, which runs counter to the attacks on complexity and red tape that we are pursuing nationally and at a European level. The consensus that has emerged in Committee has strengthened my determination to take the negotiations forward. I hope that that consensus is not solely the result of the Commission's flax and hemp proposals, as the hon. Member for North Shropshire seemed to suggest. I hope that there will be consensus on many other issues. I am grateful to members of the Committee for the questions that they have raised and the contributions that they have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
