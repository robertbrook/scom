	<p>[Continuation from column 1616]</p>

	<p>9.48 pm</p>

	<p>
	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we were rudely interrupted, I wanted to quote the hon. Member for Swindon, one of the silent members of the Committee. He has not spoken here but last week he spoke on another crucially important embarrassment for the Government. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have to say in the way of an apology that I and the majority of my colleagues in Parliament did not appreciate the way it would work. We got it wrong."</p></blockquote>
Had the Prime Minister said that this afternoon he might not have had such a reception. The hon. Member for Swindon was talking about the Child Support Agency. He was trying to extend the culpability for the mistake across more than just the parliamentary Conservative party. That was the point he was making but he might just as well have spoken about the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill. Had he been listening during all the long hours he has spent here he should be beginning to realise precisely what sort of difficulty the Government are getting themselves into, particularly in respect of water and sewerage services which we are now beginning to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the contrition that the hon. Member for Swindon showed about the Child Support Agency, rightly and properly given what has now come to light, should be applied to the Bill. His boss is absent, but the hon. Gentleman remains silent. Inside himself I am sure that he is beginning to have the same nagging doubt about water and sewerage in Scotland that he should have had earlier about the Child Support Agency. Those who watch our proceedings should be aware of that background information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard the Government's new explanations for their case. I call them new because we have not had much by way of explanation from them up to now. Their first argument is that there is no alternative to their proposal: the old authorities have gone and joint boards are not good enough. But there is an alternative. It is before the Committee in this very amendment, which calls for 12 boards, mirroring the existing local authority structure. It is a structure that works and delivers and has produced good quality water for the people of Scotland. The Government should vote for that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government want verification they should not listen to me because I would be seen to be partisan, they
	<span class='label label-info column'>1618</span>
should turn to page 21 of their consultative document. A rereading of it would reward any hon. Member, because it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A 15 authority model could arguably work as well as the current 12 authority structure, although some joint working arrangements might be needed."</p></blockquote>
The Government's own document contains the admission that the Opposition's amendment would work effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have exposed the Government's case as the poverty-stricken case that it is. Our 12 board structure would maintain the effectiveness of the delivery of water and sewerage services and would provide boards that were both close and accountable to the people they served. Conservative Members have told us that only quangos could have the expertise to run the water and sewerage industry. No one in this Committee or the wider world really believes that. No one believes it is necessary to have quangos uniquely made up of the Secretary of State's appointees to do the job better than local councillors who have done it for the past 150 years during which the industry has been in the public sector. We have been told. that it is necessary to have the quangos to avoid the constraints on the public sector borrowing requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North, displaying that financial acumen that has made him a legend in his lifetime, tells us that we cannot possibly continue down the present path because we would have neither the expertise or the scale to attract money and that, in any event, it would fall foul of the PSBR regime. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow, in an incisive contribution, pointed out the fallacy involved in the way in which this country calculates the PSBR.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members should turn to the consultative document again. It is a veritable treasure trove for those wishing to pick holes in the Government's case. The proposal for the creation of new water authorities is outlined on page 22. That is the option chosen by the Government, the one that we are seeking to amend to today. The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As public sector bodies, however, investment would remain subject to the constraints of public expenditure."</p></blockquote>
Conservative Members' crucial argument is demolished by the Government's consultative document. The effect would be exactly the same as for joint boards run by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North of course knows better than any consultative document—after all, he is sitting beside the man who, presumably, wrote it and who certainly persuaded the Government to pursue the course that they are on. The hon. Member for Ayr may well be somewhere imagining a great new scheme to save the Prime Minister's skin. I ask Conservative Members who have not read the consultative document to read it carefully and to reach the only possible conclusion—that the Government's case is threadbare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members, and, indeed, the Minister, have spoken of new private sector finance to pay for the investment that has been sadly missing from the public sector, but the reality of the new water structure will be just as it was under privatisation in England and Wales, where such promises were made, but where the facts proved different. Investment did not arrive and the customers will therefore have to pay. In a rare, frank, moment the hon. Member for Tayside, North admitted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1619</span>
that. He said that he did not know how much the customer will be willing to pay, and that the market will need to be tested, but his implication with regard to charges was, "As much as we can get away with." Not that there will be much choice. The consumer will not be able to choose between Strathclyde water, Central water, northern or eastern or even East Anglia water. Consumers take from the tap what they can get, so prices will be very inelastic. The authorities will charge what they want, as they do in England and the charges will go up and up inexorably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night I spoke to an hon. Member in the Tea Room, who told me that in his area water rates had increased from £30 for a household to £300. The local water charge is virtually the same as the council tax. The same thing will happen in Scotland. The magical idea that the consumer will be protected by the injection of private finance is completely bogus and idiotic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that we have conjured a spectre of privatisation with which we have scared all the innocent voters of Eastwood and Ayr and 1.25 million voters in Strathclyde. The Under-Secretary, the hon Member for Dumfries has said, "Unfair! I have told them that it will not be privatised". The Minister may be a nice and decent guy, of whom, in Committee, one might say, "I would buy a used car from him." One would not, however, buy a used water industry from him. I do not know whether this Parliament is to be his last or his second last. He is a Minister now, but he may not be always. Few people hang on long as Ministers for the Government—they do not hang on long as Prime Minister either. The Under-Secretary's assurances will be listened to, but if they are not believed it is nothing to do with the Opposition. It is because of the healthy scepticism of the Scottish population, who have listened to promises from the Government before, and have found that they have been betrayed time upon time. If the Minister says, on behalf of the Government, "There will be no privatisation," the source is the same as the assurance that "We have no plans to extend VAT".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen on Friday? The Government who claimed to be the party of low taxation will put the equivalent of 7p in the pound on taxes from the end of the week. Because of the broken promises from the party that said that it would reduce taxes year on year, families will, as the Chief Secretary of the Treasury admitted on the "Today" radio programme this morning, pay an extra £10 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's promises do not stand up. The suspicions will linger because they are justified. The Government cannot run from that nor avoid people's suspicion, hostility or refusal to believe that the precious water that they regard as so fundamental will remain in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall soon vote on amendment No. 553, which provides our alternative to the Government's plans for the three super-quangos. We propose what the Government earlier defended as absolutely essential for the police and fire services—large and efficient joint boards for the water industry which are also close enough and accountable enough to continue to deliver the service to the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1620</span>
Perhaps, in a few minutes' time, the amendment will be defeated. We have seen that happen to many amendments in this Committee. It will not, however, be the last decision on the issue. The next group of amendments relates to virtually the same subject, certainly in terms of accountability. We shall return to the arguments and shall test the Government's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from decisions that may be taken on Report or even on Third Reading in the House, and perhaps in the House of Lords, a final crucial decision will be made on the Government's fate on 5 May. In elections throughout Scotland, on every street corner, there will be a chance for the Scottish people to make that decision; it will not be made in an obscure Committee Room in the Committee Corridor of the House of Commons, where those who do not bother about debate have not listened to the views of people in any part of Scotland, never mind in Strathclyde. That neglect will be set aside. The message of the ballot box will be clear. Even the Government, who hate public opinion with such venom, will be unable to avoid that message.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to my hon. Friends and I warn Conservative Members that when the people give that message, through the democratic channels that so many Conservative Members despise so much, it will be rightly punishing for the Government. That decision will not be made here tonight: it will come much later. What happens tonight, however, will be the evidence on which the people make that punishing decision on 5 May.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will be the last fling and attempt to get an answer to three questions that have been asked before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Minister spent much of the morning criticising COSLA's estimated increase in domestic water charges of £2 per year from each household. I ask him for the third time: can he indicate how much the charges will increase under his proposed new authorities to fund the extra £5 billion capital expenditure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I return to my quotation from the Prime Minister's letter to the president of COSLA:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the case for change is not that the local authorities have fallen down on the job but that a different structure is now needed if a very large investment programme is to be achieved over the next 10–15 years without further increasing public expenditure and putting pressure on the public sector borrowing requirement."</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister explain what facilities will be available to the new authorities to achieve the objective set out by the Prime Minister which would not be available if the service remained within local authority control?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, in response to an earlier question, the Minister stated that customer councils would provide the equivalent protection currently provided by the democratic system. How can that be so, as I understand that the councils will be comprised of a small group of the Secretary of State's nominees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there any chance of receiving answers to those questions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is something terribly wrong with the debate and the Government's attitude to water services, Scottish local government and Scottish opinion. No attempt has been made even to recognise that the people of Scotland gave their opinion at the general election and in the recent referendum. The Government have ignored that in the most extreme cavalier fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1621</span>
I am disturbed that we have not had either a justification or an answer to some basic questions. Why were the boundaries chosen? What is the rationale behind the choice? What costs will be involved in creating the new headquarters for the larger quangos? What will the committees do—they have not even been mentioned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What criteria will the Government use to appoint members to the board? It has been hinted that councillors will be involved. That represents a veneer of democracy—it is not even an attempt to create a democratic link with the people who are paying for the services. How will the boards be organised? How can 11 people truly represent and reflect the wishes and needs of people in the northern, western and eastern areas? How will the population of those areas be represented? How will local needs be registered and dealt with? We have had no answers about that, apart from some mindless gibbering from the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South. The Government should be giving us answers, because they are imposing this policy on Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not simply out of touch—they are out of orbit. The Minister has told us several times that he would never privatise water, and I take his word on that. He will not, however, be a Minister at the Scottish Office for ever. I remind him of similar promises. Neil MacFarlane, Under-Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment said in 1984:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have absolutely no intention of privatising the water industry. The Government have no plans to urge that upon the water authorities. There has been some press speculation about it in the past, but there is no intention to do so." [
	<i>Official Report,</i> 19 December 1984; Vol 70, 
	<i>c.</i> 457.]</p></blockquote>
That was a similar promise, made by a former Minister. Yet in 1986—a mere two years later—the then Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the last six years we have made the water authorities fit and ready to join the private sector …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Privatisation is the next logical step. It will bring benefits to customers, to the industry itself and to the nation as a whole". [
	<i>Official Report,</i> 5 February 1986; Vol. 91 
	<i>c.</i> 288.]</p></blockquote>
So while I am ready to believe the Minister, I remind him that such promises are easily made but not so easily kept when other people take over responsibility for certain services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Linlithgow asked whether the Minister had visited the water authorities, the answer was no. He has been at the Scottish Office for years, yet he has never visited one of Scotland's major institutions and a major provider of daily services. He has never visited the water authorities, yet he is perfectly prepared to wipe them out. That sums up the Government's attitude to the people of Scotland and to the services. The Government have given no justification for the plan. They just have a majority in Committee, which they are about to use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why would an unelected quango run Scotland's water services better than elected local authorities? There is no answer to that, apart from the Government's dogma and a combination of their past policy mistakes. Local authorities do the job, supplying high quality services at low prices. "It ain't broke, so why fix it?" as they say. It is being fixed because of the Government's dogma and mistakes. Three giant quangos will never deliver that kind of service. Scotland is run by too many quangos. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>1622</span>
are already 5,000 appointees, and here we have another set. Major aspects of our economy and national life are run by unelected bodies, hand-picked by the Secretary of State. I have a good idea what that is called, but it is not democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The heart of the Union now shows how it operates. No matter what the Scottish people say—if every man, woman and child in Scotland wanted something and clearly expressed that wish—the Government's response is, "Your opinions don't matter." That arrogance is exceedingly hard to take. When the Government go back to face the Scottish population, they will deserve all they get.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to explore why the Government are not bothering with any of the serious points that have been raised. We will have to have some changes in the water industry, because changes are taking place in the local authority system. The water industry will face financial difficulties as a result of the spending that is necessary, but it does not automatically follow that there must be a quango, nor does it automatically follow that there must be three of them. The Government have made no attempt, as far as I can see, to explain why the two difficulties that they have identified lead to the solution that they have proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the Committee stage is meant to be where details are hammered out and explanations sought, and where the big set pieces argued Downstairs come to be thrashed out as the Government explain their position. I am appalled by the Minister's lack of argument. He makes his fellow Minister, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, look extremely competent. I thought that he had been put up to make the other Minister, the hon. Member for Eastwood, look good, but he is getting worse. His was the worst explanation of Government policy that I have ever heard. He did not make an effort to explain it, because he took the view that the Committee does not matter and that it would waste his time to try to explain it to us. He has a majority behind him and so can ram through the proposal anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the Minister is embarrassed. Even if that were the case, he could at least have read out a decent brief explaining why he was in favour of the changes that he proposes. He did not bother to do so. He has not suggested why he is hostile to the concept of joint boards, of combining the local authorities under their new boundaries. Given the example of police and fire services, it may be possible to combine the individual water authorities, perhaps under the existing arrangements, to continue the present water and sewerage services. If professional judgment or advice from officers led the authorities to believe that they were too small, they could combine and form a larger joint board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my experience of Strathclyde, I have not yet heard a single argument from the Government about why Strathclyde and Dumfries and Galloway should go together. As far as I am aware, there are no interconnecting pipelines and no arrangements for ensuring efficiency from linking the two areas: they have just been jammed together. The Government owe it to us to provide an explanation for that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government gave some explanations and the first one that I quite liked referred to ministerial accountability. It was suggested that members of quangos
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1623</span>
would be more accountable than local councillors because it would be clear that a single Minister would be responsible for everything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<p>As a Member of Parliament representing a Glasgow constituency, I remember the Peterken affair in Greater Glasgow health board. I cannot recall a Minister who was accountable or even who actually knew anything about it. All we heard from Ministers was, "It is nothing to do with me. It was some civil servant down the line, or some officer who did it and did not discuss it with me. We do not know what was going on." Where is the accountability in that system? I recognise that a Minister cannot be expected to understand every detail of the operation of a Department or of a quango, but not one Minister could be found who knew anything about a case as major as the Peterken affair and the issues that flowed from it. If you want us to consider the concept of ministerial responsibility, you must do better than that.</p>

	<p>The second argument was that experts are required. I am not certain what you are saying about existing arrangements. Has the existing arrangement been seen to be professionally deficient and so experts must be included on the boards? I am not certain what you think that the existing system cannot do.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Until now I have not said a word; perhaps the hon. Gentleman can refer to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I am not certain what the Government think is so inadequate in the existing arrangements that require improvement. The Minister said that the Government want to make the system better. Presumably, if they want to do that, they must be able to identify ways in which the existing system is failing. They must have identified and been able to put their finger on some areas where improvements could be made. The Minister has not, however, put them forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the principle is that the services are so important that they should be run by experts brought in from outside, why are services such as police, fire, education, social work, housing and leisure, and all other local authority responsibilities, mainly in the hands of democratically elected councillors? What is unique about the water and sewerage service that it requires experts, the majority of whom will inevitably turn out to be Conservatives? Why does it have to have input from business men and from people with interests in the water industry, when all other services can be left alone?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North made an important point about political fallout. The implication was that councillors, or other democratically elected people, would not have the bottle to face the difficult political decisions about raising charges. I understand that, but the hon. Gentleman does local authorities a disservice if he believes that they have not been prepared in the past to face up to difficult decisions. It is a different matter to say that councillors have come to a conclusion on rents with which one disagrees. That is not an issue
	<span class='label label-info column'>1624</span>
about whether they are prepared to face up to difficult decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members assume that the decision to be made is that the costs of the water industry must be borne out of current charges, as distinct from borrowing which is deferred taxation. That is a political judgment. It is like the question of buying a house. Should the house be bought right away in the first year, even though it is an assset that will be used over a long period? The balance between charges and borrowing is a decision about whether the costs are borne by this generation or future ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, it is not unreasonable that the costs of assets to be purchased, which must last for several generations, should be part paid for by future generations. That is the balance between borrowing and charges. It is a political decision, not a decision to be taken by experts, and so should more appropriately be made by people who are democratically accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The claims that quangos are accountable do not stack up. I have never know members of quangos to have surgeries in which they can meet individuals who want to raise particular problems. If one writes to them, one is fobbed off by a letter from an officer explaining the policy of this or that board. People do not experience direct, face-to-face contact with a member of a quango who is responsible for making decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the decision on charging relates to disconnections. It would be difficult for elected members of councils to condone a consistent pattern of disconnections, yet if water is to be run as a profit-making industry, it is inevitable that disconnections will form an integral part of that process. How else can financial returns be guaranteed unless there are penalties for non-payment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At some stage we must turn to the question of the legitimacy of the Government. I was struck by the number of hon. Members who spoke about the Union because the same question was uppermost in my mind. I beat the Scottish National party, in a vigorous fight, to become Member of Parliament. My commitment to the concept of a partnership between the countries of the Union is not in doubt. I have never believed that the Union should operate as it is currently operating. There must be an element of consent and of taking into account the views of its different parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am appalled by Conservative Members' casual disregard of Scottish political opinion. They sweep aside in a cavalier way and treat with sheer and utter contempt the strongly held views of Scottish people. It is not good enough simply to say that those people have been misled: 97 per cent. cannot be entirely deluded. Perhaps some of them were frightened by Labour party scare stories, but we do those people a disservice if we do not believe that they considered the position for themselves and concluded that what lies behind the Conservative party's proposals is the spectre of privatisation. That is what they believe. They are right to believe that on the evidence that exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may make a minor retreat. They might be prepared to allow one or two token councillors on the authorities, but that will not be adequate. I believe that privatisation is on the way. I listened with care to the Minister's assurances that that was not in his mind, but I draw the Committee's attention to the Prime Minister's promise in which he stated:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0900">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1625</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I've made the pledge in the past—I've made it clear. We have no need and no plans to extend the scope of VAT."</p></blockquote>
That was said on 27 March 1992. Presumably, that was right then but what has happened since? That promise, which was possibly made in good faith, has been totally abandoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another example, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we will not have to increase taxes. I cannot see any circumstances in which that will be necessary."</p></blockquote>
That was said by the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont), the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, on 31 March 1992. On another occasion it was said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Come what may, we intend to stick within our band of the ERM. We may have no intention whatsoever of altering our parity".</p></blockquote>
That was what the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames claimed on 27 November 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we come to my favourite, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is going to be no devaluations, no leaving the ERM. We are absolutely committed to the ERM. It is at the centre of our policy. We are going to maintain sterling's parity and we will do whatever is necessary and I hope that there is no room for any doubt about that at all."</p></blockquote>
The last phrase is particularly good. That statement appears as absolutely unequivocal as the commitment that we have received from the Minister that there will be no water privatisation in Scotland at any time in the future. The former Chancellor's commitment was abandoned speedily, so I have no faith in the Government's commitment to keep the water industry in public ownership. I believe that they intend to sell off water as quickly as possible. That is why we should oppose the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 588, in page 129, line 4, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"3. The property of an authority shall not be disposed of whether by disposal or lease for more than 21 years, unless the authority has received the consent of all of the councils constituted under section 2 of this Act whose areas form part of the area of the authority, provided always that such consent shall not be required in respect of disposals with a value of less than £50,000 in the case of a single disposal but shall nevertheless be required if the aggregate value of disposals (for less than £50,000) in any financial year has already exceeded £500,000.".</p></blockquote>
The debate will, in a sense, be a re-run of the arguments advanced in the previous two sittings. This probing amendment relates to property and reveals a new aspect of the quango deals with which the Government are besotted. It is designed to protect some of the assets that will be passed to the three new super-quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we consider the English and Welsh examples in our debate because their 10 water and sewerage companies are a scandal. The privatisation of water and sewerage services was supposed to be a cost-effective, value-for-money operation, designed to provide consumers with a higher quality of water at a reasonable cost. Nothing could be further from the truth. The phrase that sums up what has happened is rip off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard earlier that English water companies had amassed massive profits and paid massive dividends. Often, that is part and parcel of the asset-stripping by water companies of the property and assets distributed to them. It is important that we bear that in mind in the Scottish context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider Strathclyde. There is an abstract notion that eventually pipes, sewerage works, treatment works and staff will be sold—or, in the case of Strathclyde, passed on. But some of the most valuable property in terms of recreation, amenity and countryside will also be passed to the three super-quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that respect, accountability is crucial. The Government do not have a clue what accountability means in a modern democracy. They are operating
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1627</span>
outwith democracy so why should they have any regard for my arguments? Who in their right mind would want to pass over, without batting an eyelid, the facilities surrounding Loch Katrine or those surrounding the reservoirs that serve Fife, to three super quangos, to be run by the placemen and women of the Conservative party? That is a frightening prospect for any Committee and is clearly one of the reasons for last week's momentous achievement in the Strathclyde referendum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People view water as something to be drunk and sewage treatment as an essential for modern communities, but they are also concerned about the environment. The first question that we need to establish is what has been built into the mess for which the Government have just voted, by way of safeguards for the valuable property, recreational and other assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Asset-stripping is a very germane topic in Scotland now. The establishment of quangos leads to the important considerations of secrecy and sleaze. Schedule 7 contains nothing about the public disclosure of items that are discussed behind closed doors. Why on earth should we give valuable property and land to quangos, which will meet in private and, behind closed doors, take multi-million pound decisions, that could leave the public worse off and, on eventual privatisation, leave a few individuals much better off? The secrecy factor is vital. Nothing in schedule 7 promotes openness in Government. It is all about the cosy clique which we have discussed before, destroying and selling off public assets—all behind closed doors. What safeguard will the Minister provide this evening for the future of the items that I have mentioned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we could euphemistically call the sleaze factor had been apparent in the Greater Glasgow health board with the Peterken fiasco and in local enterprise companies all over the country. The closed-door syndrome that arises with quangos often leads to deals being struck that are in the interests not of the public, but of a few people who are hand-picked to dominate the institutions. The sleaze factor must be taken seriously. It is a sad indictment of modern democracy that a Government care so little that they are willing to transfer multi-million pound assets to organisations in the guise of quangos, which will, we are told, be closer to the community by virtue of the Secretary of State's picking those who sit on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scandal, sleaze and secrecy tell us what quangos are about. The three super quangos—or let us call them mega quangos, as they will deal with billions of pounds worth of assets which belong, and which the Government pretend will always belong, to the Scottish people—give rise to justifiable concern about the issues that the amendment raises. The amendment is intended to investigate the Government's true intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the Government do with Loch Katrine, where there is some of the most beautiful scenery in Europe? Will they pack all of that in a trunk and give it to the three quangos? Who can trust them? Who can set down criteria that will tie them down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer reinforces our alarm, because the Secretary of State is a Conservative—part of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1628</span>
the quango-mad Government who want to deny electors a role in their communities and to elevate the interests of unelected bodies such as quangos. I am still not reassured by the fact that the Secretary of State will have his hand on those vital assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there a problem with the performance of the engineering, water and sewerage committees that run the valuable assets? Can anybody tell me about a bit of sleaze or scandal surrounding regional council water and sewerage committees? Do they meet in secret behind closed doors to take multi-million pound decisions? Of course not. The Government cannot put forward any argument that would undermine the credibility of valuable public and elected institutions, but that will all be removed if we proceed with the three super quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must tell us whether safeguards will be introduced to protect property, land and valuable recreational assets, both in the transition to the super quangos—if the crazy Bill goes ahead—and after they are established. The Government are badly neglecting the Scottish people as they negate the very local democracy that has been the safeguard of their rights and concerns over a long period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another interesting point is the scale of the assets of property that will be handed over. I do not think that the Government understand the Bill. We have shown the Bill to be half-baked. Ministers have shown little grasp of the brief or of an understanding of the Bill's implications. The Scottish people have to suffer such contempt in the Committee day in, day out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The briefing from Strathclyde explains that its water is supplied from 10 natural lochs, 139 impounding reservoirs and 93 stream intakes springs and bore holes. They are very much part of the beautiful recreational assets in Scotland. Has the Minister given any thought to such assets? Has he studied the serious implications of what will happen when the assets are handed over to the quango placemen and women? What do we say tonight to the people of Strathclyde who voted last week to stop the madness? They now find that they have the prospect of being asset-stripped, as we move from three super quangos to three super privatisation outlets. I find it astonishing that any Opposition Member should suffer the indignity of discussing such rubbish that is called Government legislation. We want the Minister to give reassurances over our anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This issue links back to the financial structure of the new quangos. The PSBR constraints mean that we shall be doing nothing very different from the existing local authority structure. If the quangos are to be involved in franchising, partnership schemes and contracting out, they will be doing nothing that the local authority structure could not have done. Would not it be tempting for some of the remote quangos to flog off assets to make up for shortfalls arising through their own incompetence? As they move towards privatisation, will they do what is happening in England and Wales? It is important to know that, after privatisation, the English and Welsh companies acquired £275 million of the most valuable and recreational land in England and Wales. What are they doing with it? They are involved in what is technically called diversifications. The 10 English and Welsh water companies are involved in over 200 diversifications. Such diversifications include buying television companies, hotel chains and anything, in any other country, so long as it adds to the asset base and cash flow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1629</span>
The two-tier worry that we predict will occur. It is bad enough that all of those assets are placed in the hands of friends and cronies of the Conservative party. Think what will happen when the Government eventually privatises the three super-quangos; any semblance of public safeguards will be removed. Then there will be a free-for-all in which valuable assets will be disposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have highlighted briefly our initial concerns on an important schedule. The amendment stands on its own and we hope that the Minister makes it clear that he understands our anxieties and the views of almost 1.2 million Strathclyde voters who share them. After the pathetic response from the Government, we hope that Ministers will start to take seriously the real problems that people face, rather than merely the problems faced by the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central rightly concentrated on the comparison with England and Wales in relation to property. I have four questions for the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, is the minister aware that section 25 of the Water Act 1989, which privatised the water sector in England and Wales, empowers the Secretary of State for the Environment, with the consent of the Treasury, to make grants or loans to privatised water companies which find themselves in financial difficulties? Is he also aware that the same section empowers the Secretary of State to guarantee the repayment of principal and the payment of interest on such companies' existing borrowings? Can he explain why the Treasury rules take no account of that contingent liability in respect of the English and Welsh undertakings, yet include the borrowings of the Scottish undertakings within the PSBR, even though they impose no liability on the Treasury?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question concerns capital expenditure. In a study commissioned by COSLA, Scottish and Westminster Communications found that more than 60 per cent. of the capital expenditure incurred by English and Welsh water authorities was funded from revenue contributions. The effect of that has been greatly to increase consumer charges. Will the Minister intervene if the new water boards choose to finance their capital programmes in the same way? If so, what level will he consider unsatisfactory—above 60 per cent., above 50 per cent., above 40 per cent., above 30 per cent., or what?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question relates to domestic sewage, which is currently charged for as part of the council tax. As such, it is predominantly funded by revenue support grant. Will the Minister explain what is to happen to the domestic sewage element of the revenue support grant after reorganisation? Will it be used to reduce charges as part of a transition relief scheme under clause 77, or will it be—as has been widely suggested—quietly transferred and used to pay for the transitional costs of local government reorganisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the aftermath of the Strathclyde referendum, is the Secretary of State so out of touch with public opinion that he can even consider a policy which will see water and sewage consumers facing higher charges to pay for the transitional costs of his local government reorganisation? I begin to suspect that that is in part his aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth question—the final one, for the moment—is, if control of the new water authorities is other than through democratically elected representatives, what
	<span class='label label-info column'>1630</span>
machinery will be in place to ensure that capital programmes for infrastructure for new developments ensure that local priorities are being met? I have asked that question before in that precise form. No answer has been forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the Megget reservoir and Edinburgh sewage disposal schemes, completion of which cost £60 million and £50 million respectively, Lothian regional council has concentrated resources on cleaning up the east Lothian coastline, as my hon. Friend the member for east Lothian knows. It is about to start the River Almand purification scheme in my constituency and in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) to improve the river's condition and to lift the current inhibition of development in many parts of west Lothian, including Livingston new town. My hon. Friend the member for Livingston and I would like to know how the control of the new water authorities is to operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred in passing to the development of the interceptor sewer along the east Lothian coastline to divert the material which is discharged into the Firth of Forth to the major sewage treatment works at Seafield in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a purely sewage undertaking; it has been planned in co-operation with other local authorities to enhance the landscape of the coastline and has led to a new pathway along the head of the beach past Longniddry, Prestonpans and Musselburgh. It is of great advantage to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that, in future, such developments, if undertaken exclusively by a water and sewerage super-quango, will not be planned in such an enlightened manner. I cannot envisage circumstances in which such property will be sold, Mr. Martin, so I am in danger of straying out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the anxiety that was expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central about recreational rights, access to reservoirs and waterways, fishing rights and access to boating, canoeing and sailing on reservoirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real estate is potentially valuable. No doubt in many constituencies there are reservoirs and waterways which at present belong to the regional water and sewerage departments and are available for use by the local community, by visitors, by schools and by youth clubs at a nominal charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone can buy a ticket to fish the Whiteadder reservoir in the Lammermuirs in my constituency. It belongs to the Lothian region water department and is a valuable public asset used by visitors, by the local community and, most importantly, by schools and youth clubs for adventure training, sailing and suchlike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a risk that, in future, the managers of such property and the land around it might be sorely tempted to regard it as an asset that could be cashed in or used to generate greater income, in which case they would not look to youth clubs, to schools or to people interested in a day's fishing, but to big returns and, perhaps, selling rights to people who wanted to set up lucrative commercial sailing, boating and fishing enterprises. That would be a disaster and a serious loss to the neighbourhoods concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0903">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1631</span>
Following the vote on amendment No. 553 and clause 61 stand part, I find our proceedings the most depressing experience I have had in the House of Commons since I sat on the Committee that dealt with the poll tax for Scotland. I saw similar silly expressions on the faces of Conservative Members then, sneering at the representatives of the Scottish majority and thinking that, because they are in charge, they can get away with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members got away with it up to a point—they practically all lost their seats at the next general election—but the people in Scotland suffered, as did respect in Scotland for the House of Commons. That is dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to Conservative Members to address seriously the general issue and the narrow issue of property and assets that have been built up at public expense as a result of the actions of public-spirited local authorities over many years. We face the prospect of assets being raided and sold for short-term profit by appointed quangocrats. That will add insult to injury for the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a narrow, but important point. I appeal yet again to Conservative Members on the Committee—even if the Scots do not know what is good for them, surely the English Members, if they care anything for the Union, must address these issues more seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The pleas of the hon. Member for East Lothian are falling on deaf ears. Again, 11 votes to 12 will be the deciding factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the water services are to be hijacked out of democratic local government control, there is an obvious fear that the assets will be stripped, there is also an obvious wish to ensure that the assets created by the community are, as far as possible, retained for its benefit. However, those decisions will be taken out of the hands of democratically-elected, accountable people, and put into the hands of folk who meet behind closed doors—the chosen few, selected for the purpose by the Secretary of State for Scotland. When we see examples of that happening elsewhere, it does not inspire confidence in the appointees' competence or sensitivity regarding local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that property shall not be disposed of without the consent of democratically elected councils. It is an insurance policy to try to ensure that the public interest is maintained in a very closed system of operation. At the heart of the amendment lies the concern that the Bill is simply a staging post to outright privatisation. Ministers have stated that they have no current plans to privatise Scottish water services. It is the word "current" which is important, and which concerns us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The road to privatisation in England was a two-stage process, starting with the creation of water boards similar to those proposed for Scotland. In other words, it is privatisation in two sips rather than one gulp. The amendment is an attempt to provide public safeguards for the community interest as opposed to the interest of the chosen few or, more importantly, the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that no water authority property can be sold off without the consent of the local authority involved. It is simply a safeguard against the theft of Scotland's water assets, which are community
	<span class='label label-info column'>1632</span>
assets. Central Government did not create massive property and other assets—they were built up by generations of local taxpayers, and founded by local people for local communities. As far as possible, such assets should be retained for the benefit of those communities, but that will no longer be possible because the assets will be in the hands of 11 hand-picked people who will take decisions behind closed doors. There will be a feeling of helplessness among communities in Scotland when decisions are taken without their knowledge and participation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Keep out. Private."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. Those decisions will be taken by the chosen few to suit their own purposes rather than the public interest. There will not be the acknowledgement of the public interest that is automatic when people are elected by the public to whom they are answerable at the ballot box. That system will change and that will give rise to a feeling of helplessness among local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example of the health boards can do little but cause people to feel trepidation if the same is to happen to water services. We are talking about the property of local communities, which generations of people have paid for. It is now being commandeered by central Government and their hand-picked quangos. In any other circumstances, that would be called theft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise the subject of pensions. What will happen to the huge available pension funds? Will water industry workers retain all existing rights and benefits? Will the Minister consider that question seriously and respond to it? What safeguards will there be regarding the public provision of water services continuing after the Government's pet quangos have been created?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The placemen and women on those quangos will control vast, publicly created assets. They will be able to sell them, close them or alter them as they wish, without consultation or mandate from the public. It is no good the Minister producing an amendment that allows one public meeting a year. That is simply pathetic. They are public assets, now commandeered by the Government through their quangos. The health boards in Scotland are an horrific reminder of the fate that awaits Scotland's water assets and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decisions on those assets will have repercussions on the wider economy and in every local community in which assets are moved or sold off. Those decisions will be made by the chosen few rather than the public and they will not necessarily be made in the public interest. The select few will meet behind closed doors, with no electoral mandate or link with the public whom they are supposed to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quangos will dispose of and deal with massive, publicly created assets. The amendment deals with that problem, but the Government must tackle it. We have all seen what has happened in practice with the Government's other quangos. I do not want that process to continue with our vast water assets, which will now be dealt with by between seven and 11 hand-picked individuals. That really is a system out of the old Soviet Union; such a system has no place in a modern democracy. The Government should be ashamed of what they have done. The Minister may not have answered the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0904">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1633</span>
previous debate, but I hope that he will at least respond to the worries about the assets that he has just commandeered on behalf of his Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what my hon. Friends have said about the attitude displayed by the Government in Committee. It is a disgrace that the Government and their supporters in Committee have chosen completely to ignore what the people in Scotland tell them about the proposals. Those members of the Committee who voted to pass clause 61, unamended, voted to ignore what the normal 75 per cent. anti-Tory section of the Scottish population and even their own Tory electors were telling them—they do not want the water authorities transferred from democratic control in Scotland into the hands of unelected quangos. Conservative Members chose completely to ignore the voice of the Scottish people, across all the parties in Scotland. Instead, they chose to pursue their original course of action and were unimpressed by what their supporters in Scotland were saying. That displays an arrogance which has arisen because of the length of time during which the Conservative party has been in office. The Government have been in power for far too long; they cannot now even distinguish between what is democratic and undemocratic and what is right and wrong in the interests of their own supporters. They should be ashamed of their conduct in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike my hon. Friends, I am not all that surprised by such behaviour. From the very first moment when I served on a Committee, I understood that Committees are not democratic in any sense. They do not reflect the attitude of the people of Scotland to legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whatever the hon. Member feels about the Committees, there are Standing Orders that say that hon. Members must keep to the amendments. The hon.

On this amendment, as on previous amendments, the argument centres on how the investment that is required to meet the European Community directives will be funded. The only real argument from the Minister and his supporters for the quangos is that they are the only means by which the necessary investment might be raised to meet the standards expected by those directives. We should bear that in mind when we examine the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider my own area of Tayside. It has estimated that, to meet the requirements of the EC directives, it will need to invest an additional £270 million. That is over and above the other capital investment requirements that the council faces. Taken together, the total sum required to be invested in Tayside is some £460 million. At present Tayside regional council gets capital allocations of around £21 million a year from the Secretary of State for Scotland to spend on water and sewerage. At that rate of capital allocation it would take Tayside 20 years to meet the investment target of £460 million. Under the EC directive it has only until the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1634</span>
year 2000 to do so. It must find additional money from somewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue that Tayside regional council should tackle that problem in the way that COSLA suggested. The amount of money Tayside regional council can borrow should be increased so that it can make the investment and keep the water and sewerage services up to the required standard, but also under democratic control. Conservative Members argue that it is necessary to form these new unelected quangos because they will be able to raise money in ways that are unavailable to democratically elected councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two ways in which they could do that. They could increase the charges that people in Scotland pay for their water. There is a limit to that, however, and they cannot be increased to whatever level is needed to fund the investment, there comes a point when people will not pay much more. We have not yet discussed how the new water charges will be collected from the Scottish people who did not want this to happen in the first place. The level of resistance to those charges may make the poll tax rebellion look like child's play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quangos will be looking for any other means that are available to them to raise the necessary finance to invest in water and sewerage. One of the most obvious ways is to dispose of the assets that will come into their ownership. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian is absolutely right: there is not a water authority area in Scotland without at least some lochs, waterways and reservoirs often with fine buildings alongside. They are a prime asset. The unelected quangos will be sorely tempted to realise some money by selling off those assets and involving the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some high-flying tourist company may be prepared to bring in tourists and grant them exclusive fishing rights in one area, exclusive boating rights to a reservoir or exclusive use of the nice fine buildings around that reservoir. That is what they are about and those attractions would be marketed in a way that would deny access to everyone else. Only those who could afford it would be allowed access to those prime assets that will be under the control of the quangos. That would not happen if the assets remained under democratic control. The councillors would not let it happen, because if they did they would not be re-elected. That is why the Government have to get rid of democratically elected councils and why they need a quango. They have to get their hands on the assets so that they can sell them to those who can afford them and thereby exclude those who cannot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the assets around the reservoirs, the headquarters of the water services division in Dundee is in a prime marketable asset near Invergowrie. It is close to the dual carriageway leading to Perth. The new northern area water board could decide to close down the Dundee operation and move its headquarters to somewhere else like Inverness. It would sell that fine building in Dundee and pay off the people who work for the water services division and use the money for the required investment in water and sewerage. The hon. Member for Tayside, North sits there smiling. He does not like the people in Dundee. He is quite happy to see them thrown on the dole. He is happy to see assets in our city being ripped off from the public sector and sold to the private sector. He might not be smiling when attention is turned to Tayside, North and the assets which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0905">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1635</span>
water services division has in his constituency. What will happen when those assets are sold off? He will not be able to complain to his locally elected councillor about that asset stripping. He could go to the Secretary of State to complain about the actions of his appointees but given his voting record on Maastricht, the Secretary of State would not listen to anything he had to say. The hon. Gentleman will have no recourse to defend the assets of the water services division in his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interrupt my hon. Friend, but he must have noticed that the hon. Member for Tayside, North has no difficulty walking through the Lobby, or voting in Committee, on the principle of legislation but later opposing its impact on his constituency. He did it with Meikle hospital and he will do it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In parliamentary terms, the hon. Member for Tayside, North is flexible in his voting pattern in the House. People outside will know that when I use the term "flexible", I mean something else that I cannot say here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a time when some of my hon. Friends believed that the hon. Member for Tayside, North could be persuaded by argument to support us. We felt that like the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) who listened to the arguments and made up his own mind. This Committee has proved us wrong. The hon. Member is just as obedient as the worst lickspittle on the Government Benches. He will do exactly what the Government Whip tells him to do. He is not prepared to stand and fight for his constituents or the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been accused of scaremongering. No doubt the Minister will say that there is no possibility of the quangos stripping anything from the assets given to them at the time of the switch to the new authorities. Let us consider the facts in the document that described how the private English and Welsh water companies operate and shows their profits before taxation. Severn Trent Water made £229 million profit this year alone. Anglian Water made £167.7 million; North West Water made £214.7 million; Thames Water made £199.5 million and Welsh Water £115.5 million. The total profits for private water companies in England and Wales in this year alone will be £1,318,600.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where will those profits come from? They will not only come from the charges to customers because those charges will fund investments by the companies. The profits will come from asset stripping—from private water companies being able to get rid of assets that have passed to their ownership at privatisation. The Minister is handing over regional council assets to quangos to dispose of them as they see fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 588 is therefore important. It would provide that the new unelected quangos could not dispose of assets valued at more than £50,000 without the permission of the elected regional councils in their areas. That is a reasonable stand for us to take. For a start, the Government will not allow existing regional councils to spend unless they have the permission of the new shadow authorities and the Secretary of State for Scotland. Why cannot the laws that apply to the regional councils apply also to the proposed new water authorities? All the assets
	<span class='label label-info column'>1636</span>
have been built up by Scottish local authorities; they did not come from the Secretary of State, the Government or the private sector. They result from the work of local authorities in Scotland over 150 years. They are not local authorities' assets either: the people who elect those authorities are the owners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an affront to the people of Scotland that the new quangos can suddenly be set up and start selling off assets to the private sector that belong to no one but the people. Democracy is at the root of the division between us. Opposition Members understand that those assets should remain public, under public control, and accountable to the people. The Minister and his cronies are trying to block that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend think that some of those early civic leaders whose far-sightedness created the assets must be twirling in their graves as they see the heirs to the Conservative philosophy involving themselves in this enterprise? They were the people who witnessed, in days of an undoubtedly highly Conservative hue, the misery and disaster of the private sector's handling of the water and sewerage system. They brought it under municipal control and their civic pride kept it alive through myriad authorities for 150 years, so that it built up into a huge national asset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A party that still dares to call itself Conservative is engaged in dismembering the fine tradition that wiped out those fearsome public health problems. It is now contemplating the disposal of the assets that surround the reservoirs and waterworks into the private sector in order to bolster the profits and financial performance of quangos. Their financial performance will be dictated by the latter part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a lengthy but effective intervention. When I argued that those assets had been built up by local authorities over 150 years, I was not referring to Labour local authorities because the Labour party has not existed for all those years. Conservative councils help build up those assets and they were strongly in favour of keeping them in the public sector and under democratic control. Indeed, Conservative councils at one time dominated Scotland: Conservatives dominated the regional councils, especially in the north and east. They were keen to ensure that those assets remained under democratic control. The leader of Eastwood district council has accused the Minister of arrogance because he will not listen to the arguments of Conservative councillors all over Scotland who are as concerned as we are that those assets should be kept under democratic control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can remember when the Tory party was the big party in Scotland. In those days it listened to what people in Scotland said and adapted its policies to suit the needs of the people. Those days have long gone. The Tory party is now completely out of touch with not only its own grass-roots support in Scotland but with all the people in Scotland. It is, increasingly, a party that is out of touch with reality, and that will be proved at the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

future of access to recreational facilities as proposed by the Government. Perhaps hon. Members have not read future and new clauses to the Bill, which deal with the issues that they have raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider carefully the husbanding and looking after of assets, such as Loch Katrine, which have a particular significance to the people of Scotland. That is covered in the Bill. Under clause 64(2)(c), the Secretary of State and the water authorities must
	<br><blockquote><p>"have regard to the desirability of preserving for the public any freedom of access to areas of forest, woodland, mountains, moor, bog, cliff, foreshore, loch or reservoir and to other places of natural beauty".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East rightly appraised the fine buildings owned by some water authorities. Under clause 64(2)(d), the Secretary of State and the new water authorities must have special regard to buildings of architectural or historic interest. That shows clearly that the Government intend the water authorities to retain that type of building and to maintain access to recreational facilities. The hon. Gentleman should examine clause 95(2), which makes it clear that assets cannot be flogged off at any old price to suit the water authority. They must be sold at the proper market value. The hon. Member for Angus, East rightly referred to pensions because they are covered by the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am dealing with the issue raised by the hon. Member for Angus, East. According to schedule 7 (12)(2), pension schemes or staff may continue in local authority schemes by agreement with the local authorities or by an order of the Secretary of State. Where employees do not stay in the schemes, the assets are transferred at the appropriate value. There is no question that pensions will not be safeguarded by schedule 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made an interesting point about clause 95 (2). Clause 95 is entitled the "Disposal of Land", but it offers none of the protections that the Minister mentions. First, clause 95 (1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (2) below, a new water and sewerage authority may dispose of land held by them in any manner, to whomsoever and for whatever purpose they wish."</p></blockquote>
The protection in clause 95 (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Except with the consent of the Secretary of State, a new water and sewerage authority shall not dispose of land under subsection (1) above for a consideration less than the best that could reasonably be expected to be obtained on the open market."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly what we are saying. Land near a reservoir with planning permission for housing would be worth a small fortune in most parts of the country. Who will be reassured by the fact that the only protection we will have will be that provided by the Secretary of State for Scotland? He introduced this dreadful Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should turn his attention to clause 64 (2)(c) which makes it clear that the Secretary of State has great interest in access. In addition, new clause 42 refers to the type of land to which the hon. Gentleman refers, such as that near a loch in a heritage area or a site of special scientific interest. Many lochs and similar areas fall into those categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1638</span>
The Bill contains far more provision on access than that in any other previous legislation. The hon. Gentleman is driving a wedge that should not be driven. The Bill attempts to ensure that issues of preservation, conservation, access and habitat are covered so that the people of Scotland can continue to enjoy their current right of access. The hon. Gentleman is getting unduly excited about something that we are covering in legislation for the first time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall see how valid the proposals will be in terms of conservation. The amendment would prevent land being sold off and the mounting of asset-stripping operations. Birds and trees may be given some protections, but there is nothing to stop the asset base, which has been built in 150 years, being sold at vast profit to the new water authorities. There is nothing to protect the communities that built up the assets other than the Secretary of State for Scotland, whose name and guarantees have been soiled by the fact that he is the Bill's perpetrator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree. If the hon. Member reads clause 64, he will see that it offers a host of safeguards so that the Secretary of State and the water authorities consider such issues carefully. The hon. Gentleman should approve of that, because such legislative safeguards do not currently exist. They have been introduced to meet the views of conservationists and others who wanted such measures in the Bill. They have been reinforced by new clause 42, which was proposed by Scottish National Heritage to ensure that the Secretary of State and the water authorities give special consideration to the areas about which we are so concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman has taken the trouble to read the Scottish Office conservation, access and recreation code of practice for water and sewerage authorities which was published last year. The Scottish Office takes the matter very seriously and we shall ensure that the code of practice currently in place for the water and sewerage authorities will also apply to the new water authorities. The code of practice covers the issue about which the hon. Gentleman has complained. We are doing our best to provide safeguards, whether the responsibility lies with local government or, in the future, with the water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister accept that for an aggrieved party who disagreed with the Secretary of State's action, the protection in clause 64(2)(c) would require a judicial review by the High Court?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 588 would interfere with the responsibilities of the water authority to operate in the most effective way to provide the best delivery of water and sewerage services at the most reasonable cost. It would be wrong to fetter authorities by saying that they could not sell redundant property without the consent of

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked several questions that related not to the amendment or to schedule 7, but to the previous group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but the Minister well knows the pressures to proceed with the Bill. It would be reasonable, therefore, to ask that my questions are answered in clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has raised more fears on this issue than he has allayed. We suspected that he was not 100 per cent. behind the principles of the Bill and his views have now been revealed. He concluded by saying that it would be unreasonable to interfere with the rates of the new water quangos and unfair to fetter them with a duty to subject their decisions to asset-strip to the local authority which created the assets in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we should be content to depend on the Secretary of State for Scotland to protect the public interest in these affairs and that there were safeguards later in the Bill. He drew our attention to clauses 95 and 64. It would have been wise to keep quiet about clause 95 at this stage in our debate, as it is explicit an clear. It covers the disposal of land and states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"new water and sewerage authorities may dispose of land held by them in any manner, to whomsoever and for whatever purpose they wish",</p></blockquote>
subject to the consent of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton has said, the present Secretary of State and all who go with him have made it abundantly clear that they are not trustworthy. They cannot be trusted to protect the public interest, yet we are talking about the rights of access to lochs, reservoirs, rivers and surrounding lands, and about associated sporting rights. They are potentially rather lucrative assets and are ripe for the picking. That will be the advice of the bankers and estate agents who are likely to be candidates for membership of the new super-quangos if the Government have their way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a separate duty in connection with water conservation and supply under clause 64, which states that the Secretary of State shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"have regard to"—</p></blockquote>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton has noted that: it is really strong stuff—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the desirability of preserving for the public any freedom of access to areas of forest, woodland, mountains, moor, bog, cliff, foreshore, loch or reservoir and to other places of natural beauty".</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State can "have regard to" all of those—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And then ignore them, as my hon. Friend rightly says. The provision is not a safeguard. It is a fig leaf, as the Minister must know. It was reckless of him to draw the Committee's attention to those threadbare safeguards. Given what has been said, it is all the more important that we stick to our guns on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1640</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much depends on the criteria established for the running of the new boards. It is likely that they will be placed under a duty to maximise the utilisation of their assets. In such circumstances, there is no place for social factors, such as allowing ordinary people to utilise the assets through access to the forests, lochs and so on under the authorities' control. It is a matter of what is most cost-effective and of making assets sweat so that income is maximised. That will override any assumption that the boards should have regard to the interests of customers and to the desirability of preservation of access as outlined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all other things were equal, some of the commitments in clause 64 might be worth something, but I do not believe that other things will be equal. Boards will be under a clear commitment to maximise their efficiency in financial terms, so, if there is a clash, all the commitments in the clause will go by the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave the game away when he said that he did not want interference with the running of the water authority by people such as local authorities, who have social consciences and other agendas. That is why we are to have quangos. The Minister wants people who will not be under any outside pressure to do what the people as a whole want. I am much more worried now than I was when the debate started as a result of what Ministers have said. It is clear that they intend to dispose of any asset that is not absolutely and utterly essential. If they cannot privatise the water services en bloc, they will sell them piece by piece.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian said, clause 95 offers no safeguard whatsoever. It says only that land and public assets cannot be sold off cheap. That is not unreasonable. We want any revenue received from selling public assets to be the maximum possible in the circumstances. However, clause 95 gives no criteria according to which a decision about selling land or assets should be made. That clause helps us not at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response has made it clearer than ever that, having failed to get agreement to sell off the water boards in one go, the Government intend to sell them off bit by bit and piece by piece. One by one, every loch and glen will go. We must continue to oppose the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has stated the case very well and in some detail. If I understood him correctly, the Minister asked that the amendment be withdrawn so that he could consider the matter again. What further restrictions has he in mind? How does he mean to consider the matter again? The system that is being replaced is one in which public meetings are held, and in which anyone can attend regional council meetings to hear what decisions are taken about property or the sale of public assets. Such practices are normal in the regional council system. In the present set-up, inquiries can be made at councillors' surgeries and by other contacts with councillors. The matters are open and public. Equally, elections are the ultimate test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What restrictions are envisaged for the quangos? What possible quango equivalent can be found for that open, public and democratic regional council system? At present a safeguard exists in that in the event of misuse, or doubt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0908">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1641</span>
about the use of property, assets or funds, councillors can be surcharged. Is there any equivalent procedure for quangos, so that surcharging would result if mistakes were made or proper cognisance or action was not taken? What ideas has the Minister for replicating or coming close to the guarantees provided in the present open, democratic regional set-up? I should want such information and reassurance before I would advise the withdrawal of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to press the amendment further, partly because of the Government's failure to provide any substantial safeguard. The amendment is essentially a probing amendment, which we might be happy to withdraw in response to the Minister's wish to consider it further. However, without an assurance that the matter would be thoroughly considered, we should want to move to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that removal of open, elected Government scrutiny opens a pandora's box. Anything could happen under the auspices of an unelected quango that operates behind closed doors. That is a basic tenet of our attack on every clause of the Bill. We hear repeatedly that we can leave matters to the Secretary of State. How many measures would a Secretary of State want to have included in the exercise of his daily responsibilities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is staggering that, in every clause, responsibilities can be taken away from elected councils and the electors' right to vote for those responsible can be removed; everything can land on the doorstep of the Secretary of State. That cannot be right. We acknowledge that the Secretary of State must have powers in certain areas. However, we cannot accept that the adoption of all the safeguards should be left to the Secretary of State. That issue is behind our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that any Opposition Members would doubt the integrity of the hon. Member for Dumfries with regard to the matters relating to access to the countryside, about which he spoke. He has a distinguished record of involvement in those matters and we would not dispute that. However, there is a great difference between that issue and the other elements of the Government's hard right approach, exemplified by the hon. Member for Eastwood, who sees a market sign above everything. If it moves, he can sell it. If an asset is in the public service sector he says, "Let us put it in the private sector. We may be able to sell." We accept the ideas advanced about access to the countryside and recreation. However, once selling is involved, the market will override any interest that the public would want considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members should attend to what has been happening in Northumbria. In that water authority area discussions have taken place about charging the public for access to the countryside.—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am not sure what was being imitated in that sedentary intervention. My hon. Friends suggest that it was my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon), but I do not think that he would want to hear such an imitation of himself in action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If assets are disposed of to the three quangos and eventually to a private company, how can we be sure that access to facilities will not be removed or that payment will not be required for using them? There should be further safeguards. The key issues are that, if the Government want to meddle with something that works

well, has proper safeguards and open government, and if they favour a quasi-secretive world of quangos, we will not accept the response that has been made tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should acknowledge that what we have said is important. We shall withdraw the amendment only if we are reassured that the matter will be examined properly and the Bill significantly strengthened, especially in relation to the complementary clause, Clause No. 95, which gives us cause for alarm because the Secretary of State is to become involved only in relation to the price mechanism .

We have specifically included in clause 64 and new clause 42 the safeguards which we felt were necessary to cover the future of those beautiful parts of Scotland that are often owned by local authorities and, in future, will be owned by the water authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took a personal interest in this aspect of the Bill and genuinely believe that we have covered all the matters that could worry Opposition Members, including fishing and recreational activities. Water skiing takes place at some reservoirs, but not at others, and the same applies to fishing. I am keen that there should be the maximum recreational facilities in Scotland under the water authorities as under the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without making any commitment, I hope to help the hon. Member for Fife, Central by saying that I shall certainly ensure that there is sufficient strength in clause 64 and new clause 42. In the light of my offer, he might consider withdrawing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has acknowledged the distinction that I made on behalf of my hon. Friends. There are two issues: property and the potential for exploitation and asset stripping, and access to the countryside and the conservation of our heritage and environment. We are not divided from the Minister on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's offer is important, although he has not made a commitment. We have reached the stage where, if the Government are willing to consider points that have been made, we are willing to take the Minister's contribution at more than face value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that if the matter is in any way being reconsidered, public opinion—not the Opposition—must be reassured about what is happening to basic assets that they do not want moved from the current structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If public opinion is to matter—often in the Committee it does not appear to matter—we seek such important assurances. If the public could trust the Government, they should be able to take minor comfort from the Bill. However, the public cannot trust the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is happening in England and Wales is alarming and that is our benchmark. Conservative Members may say that that is a privatised system. It is in the market-place, but operates behind closed doors. While shareholders satisfy certain criteria laid down by financial services, there are many restrictions on what they can do. They are extremely limited in terms of public access to their decisions. Therefore, in that sense, the quangos are

	<span class='label label-info column'>1643</span>
not far removed from the privatised companies in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is widespread anger at how those companies make money out of assets, diversifications and disposals. It cannot be right for the Government to set up quangos or, eventually, a privatised system, in which the public interest is always secondary to the private interest. We believe passionately that the public interest is always above the interest of private capital or of private citizens generally. The House should always seek to promote that important safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that our points are taken seriously. Given the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong for the Committee to rise without some serious points being made. I do not want to spend long on them because I realise that hon. Members have had a long day. As they know, I am deeply
	<span class='label label-info column'>1644</span>
sensitive to those matters and to their feelings. All I want to do is to take this opportunity, on behalf of the whole Committee, to wish you a happy Easter, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
