	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Education (School Information) (England) Regulations 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Education (School Information) (England) Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 1502).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Education (School Performance Information) (England) Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 1503).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We prayed against these statutory instruments not because the changes were bad but because of some aspects of the league tables that result from the regulations. I shall deal first with specific changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory Instrument No. 1502 consolidates existing regulations and makes reasonable changes to the information that schools and local education authorities have to publish. We welcome the fact that schools must now publish their own prospectuses, although the changes merely recognise universal practice. At least it is now a specific requirement. It is good also that a school should refer in its prospectus to the ethos and values that guide the school. The additional information that can be obtained from the key stage 1 and 3 results in the form prescribed by the regulations is useful. No one could object to what is said about truancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The publication of information about a school is also useful for the community that it serves. It is right that a community should know exactly what a school sets out to do and its achievements. It is good to see that independent schools and further education colleges come within the ambit of Statutory Instrument No. 1502.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory Instrument No. 1503 requires schools to give information to LEAs about pupil performance and achievement, and about truancy, and LEAs to pass it on to the Secretary of State for Education, to be published in league tables for the 1993 school year. That raises important questions, and I hope that the Minister will answer some of them today. For example, he will be aware that he will not receive as much information on key stage 1 tests this year as he did last year. What estimate has the Department for Education made of the number of schools that have carried out the key stage 1 and 3 tests and, of those schools, of the number that will send the results to their LEAs to be forwarded to the Department?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
There is much anecdotal information to suggest that not all schools have carried out those tests or, if they have, that they do not intend to pass the information to their LEAs for the Department. The Department has written to the chairmen of all school governing bodies, reminding them of their legal responsibilities. That could put them in an invidious position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, teachers may decide to undertake the tests but not to pass the results to the LEA, but they would nevertheless like to tell the governing body how the school is performing. In that case, they will have passed information to the governing body that they wanted to go no further. The governing body could therefore be in some difficulty in complying with or respecting the professional wishes of the teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if teachers put through the tests but decided to inform parents how their children are doing—a universal practice, regardless of whether the tests are taken—would the Department exert pressure on the governing bodies to obtain the results from the teachers, so that they could be passed on through the system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this year, the Secretary of State missed a golden opportunity to take a step back from the rather headlong and precipitous approach to assessment, testing and the publication of tables. He should now accept what has been happening in schools and wait for the Dealing review before proceeding further. It is clear that almost no one in the teaching profession is against the use of assessment and testing, but teachers question the sort of testing and, more particularly, the incredible amount of extra work that is required after the tests are marked to complete the tables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next is the matter of truancy. It is important to know what is happening, but how many local education authorities have provided information on truancy rates in their areas? To some extent, the Department's publications on the consultation show surprising disagreements as to how truancy should be defined. Even within one LEA area, schools may apply different definitions of unauthorised absence. Greater clarification is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind that Statutory Instrument No. 1503 relates to information for league tables, what is expected of the tables? We do not believe that there is no need for comparative lists of league tables to be produced for schools at key stage 1 or any subsequent stage, unless they are related to far more sophisticated analysis than that of raw data. The publication of all league tables should stop until there is a fair and agreed way of presenting information to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that raw results are completely inadequate for that purpose. It is widely recognised that different schools have different intakes. Some recognition needs to be made of the performance of pupils in schools where the intake is relatively good as against those where it is not as good. A pupil's achievement should be examined in relation to his or her position when he or she started at the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Excellent research has been undertaken for some years at the Institute of Education at the university of London by Sally Thomas, Desmond Nuttall and Harvey Goldstein. In the first year, six local education authorities—Conservative and Labour—were involved. In the second, nine LEAs were involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The results are interesting: On average, pupils in girls' schools perform significantly better than those in mixed schools, but all-boys schools did not show a similar improvement. Pupils in voluntary schools, excluding Church of England schools, performed significantly better than those in county schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also a higher proportion of pupils entitled to free school meals were systematically associated with lower performance, and higher percentages of pupil attendance on one selected day in the 1990–91 school year were systematically associated with higher performance, higher percentages of year 11 pupils staying on in the sixth form also were—perhaps as would expect—systematically associated with higher performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proportion of pupils for whom English is a second language, school size as measured by the number of year 7 forms at entry, and school mobility do not appear to be systematically associated with lower performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those findings have a bearing on the form in which the results of any one school should be published. It is to be regretted that within the statutory instruments, the Government are not prepared to publish, alongside the examination performance indicator, the number of pupils receiving free meals, the number whose mother tongue is not English, and the unit cost of education spending. The Government might have been expected to have been prepared to accept the latter, given their views on expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that information is readily available and would usefully put the results from any school in context. It would also have shown exactly how a school was performing in relation to the type of child who entered the school. There is, for example, evidence that some of schools that score highly overall because they have a good intake come out badly when the job they have done for less able pupils is examined—taking account of pupils' performance when they started at the school and when they left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of having a fixation about comparative league tables, the Government should consider how schools provide for children with different abilities. The league tables do not show that. It would have been welcome if the statutory instruments provided for such matters to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instruments are an improvement on the previous position, but we remain intractably opposed to the publication of league tables based on raw school data on examination results. Such results cannot tell us anything useful about the way in which
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the school serves all its pupils. I hope that the Government will take account of such matters and that I shall receive a positive reponse from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.47 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak. I am not a member of the Committee, but I have the right to attend it because the regulations were referred to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, which I have the dubious privilege of chairing. That Committee is responsible for reporting to the House on specified matters—for example, the unusual use of powers, provisions that are ultra vires and outside a Minister's powers, and so on. Its task is especially difficult because this Government are producing more statutory instruments than any other Government in history and it is not surprising that some of them are defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Committee believes that S.I. No. 1503 is defective in several respects and has so reported. Copies of its report are available in the Room and in the Vote Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise two points from that rather complicated report, in which we included, as we are required to do, the memoranda that the Department for Education provided on request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 9(1) of S.I. No. 1503 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The governing body of every maintained secondary school and every maintained middle school"</p></blockquote>
is required to provide information. Regulation 9(2) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The information referred to in paragraph (1) is information".</p></blockquote>
The details of the information then follows and the paragraph concludes that the information is
	<br><blockquote><p>"contained in a document provided to the governing body by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
In statutory instruments, we make legislation that is as powerful as primary legislation—although it is not considered to be so and it tends to slide through the House without much scrutiny. Those who support the Jopling report and want to be home for tea and crumpets must consider the scrutiny of statutory instruments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going wider than is legitimately permitted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scrutiny of statutory instruments should be raised. The Committee is undertaking that scrutiny and that process takes time. By and large, the regulations are affirmative—they are certainly being prayed against. Although on average about 120 prayers are tabled, fewer than one quarter are allocated time. Many statutory instruments may contain similar mistakes that go by the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory instruments have the power of law and can bind people with criminal sanctions. However, such measures often go through unheeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Regulation 9(2) explains what should be included in the document provided to the governing body by the Secretary of State and paragraph 9 of the memorandum from the Department of Education explains:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The purpose and effect of including this wording is to emphasise the main aim of the provisions."</p></blockquote>
There is no prescriptive limitation on the amount of information that the Secretary of State can demand. Prescriptive limitation can be found in the primary legislation, but that does not provide carte blanche for the Secretary of State to say, "We want information to be published from governing bodies." That right is laid down by legislation that has passed through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 9(2) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the results in public examinations and courses leading to vocational qualifications or units achieved by pupils".</p></blockquote>
Those words do not constitute a prescriptive requirement but emphasise the main aim of the provisions. That is not the purpose of the legislation. It is perfectly legitimate to include that emphasis in an explanatory note—that is what explanatory notes are for—but we are dealing with the content of regulations that contain words that bind people and impose legal obligations on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would explain whether regulation 9(2) is regarded by the Department as the limited amount of information that can be requested, and whether the document that will be provided to the governing body by the Secretary of State will be based entirely and exclusively on the list in regulation 9(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 11 deals with the publication of local and national performance information relating to pupils aged 16, 17 and 18 by governing bodies. Regulation 11(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The information referred to in paragraph (1) is information about the results in public examinations, courses of study for vocational qualifications and in the International Baccalaureate Diploma undertaken by pupils aged 16, 17 and 18 in schools and institutions within the further education sector".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain how the further education sector crept in? Section 22 of the Education Reform Act 1988, on which the Minister relies for the powers to produce this regulation, makes no mention of further education. In the second memorandum, for which we asked, the Department states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The information about further education institutions is prescribed in exercise of section 22 of the Education Reform Act 1988"—</p></blockquote>
a dubious case for the powers—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(as extended by section 24)".</p></blockquote>
Section 24 provides those powers as long as they are extended by order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
My information is—we have included this in our report—that no order has been made. Section 24 is not relied on in the first memorandum or in the statutory instrument, which gives rise to the suspicion that the Department was looking for something on which to base the power. It came up with section 24, which has not been exercised and applied. That is a careless way of dealing with a measure that—as I have emphasised to the Committee, and it knows full well—is as powerful as primary legislation that has gone through a convoluted and extended process in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can respond suitably by explaining how the inclusion of further education is justified when there appears to be no use of the powers available to him to do so, because that is the basis on which we have reported the order to the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not repeat many of the points made by my hon. Friend, with which I entirely agree. However, it would be helpful if he could clarify some matters raised by, and the terminology used in the regulation entitled "Interpretation" in Statutory Instrument No. 1502.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 2, the national average figures are stated as being relevant to "all schools". Does that include LEA schools, grant-maintained schools, city technology colleges and independent schools? Reference is also made to the relevant authority in relation to maintained schools as being
	<br><blockquote><p>"the authority by which the school is maintained".</p></blockquote>
Does "authority" mean local education authority or the Funding Agency for Schools, or does it have another meaning? If it means local education authority, the phrase is tautological because the relevant authority is the LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"School" is defined as meaning "a school maintained by an authority".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education (Mr. Robin Squire)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman give me a reference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is difficult because the paragraphs are not clearly marked. If there were clear references next to each paragraph, I could give them to the Minister. I am referring to Statutory Instrument No. 1502, regulation 3, entitled "Interpretation". I cannot give a line reference, because the lines are not numbered. However, by running my finger down and placing my thumb—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Gentleman wants to illustrate his point, he must do so in words that will be comprehensible when the hon. Gentleman's speech is read.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise the difficulty. Perhaps the Minister's Department will have learnt the lesson that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
numbering paragraphs would help you, Sir David, the 
	<i>Hansard writer,</i> the Minister and me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "school" appears in an inverted paragraph in the centre of page 2. Will the Minister confirm that "authority" means local education authority and, therefore, schools governed by local education authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My task is now made easier because I can refer to numbers and letters. Will the Minister confirm that "relevant authority" in regulation (4)(b) on page 4 means local education authority? Does that apply to the Funding Agency for Schools or another agency that might make the information available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise those issues because if that provision refers solely to local education authority schools, I am at a loss to understand how and where grant-maintained schools make their information available, other than within the school itself. As I understand Statutory Instrument No. 1502, information that pertains to local education authority schools will be available to parents in the offices of the local education authority. I am unclear as to whether similar information on grant-maintained schools will be available in local education authority offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That issue is of great importance in areas that have a high proportion of grant-maintained schools. In an authority such as Hillingdon—not far from here—where more than 75 per cent. of secondary schools are grant-maintained, would the local education authority provide information on those schools? If that is the case, I shall be interested to know how the Minister envisages that progressing over the years—especially if, in an area such as Hillingdon, the whole of the secondary sector becomes grant-maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of Statutory Instrument No. 1503 deals with information to be sent to the Secretary of State. Will the Minister consider the amount of information that will be produced by schools at the same time of year? It is wholly right and proper that information that parents need to make choices—or, at least, to express a preference—about which school to send their child appears at certain times of the year. It should be provided in good time to enable parents to make that choice or express that preference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much information will be required in June and July. At the moment, we are banking up a massive amount of information to be compiled by schools in June and July. The Minister should bear in mind that schools in some parts of England break up for the summer holidays quite early in July, due to local patterns that have pertained for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time as schools are producing such information as is required by part III of No. 1503, they are also marking GCSE course work and undertaking all the moderation that goes with that? For secondary schools, that is a huge task. They will also be marking assessment tests, which is another enormous task. They will have a total of six subjects
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
to mark and report on as well as moderation—putting as much care as I am sure that the Minister would want into marking and assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, many secondary schools will be holding A-levels, with all the associated pressures, and will be dealing with youngsters who are moving to the post-16 phase of education, when schools offer advice and assistance to parents about the transfer from the 16 to post-16 sector. When that transfer involves a totally separate school such as a tertiary college or a further education college, giving such advice and assistance is a major task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that another statutory instrument to come before the House will expect schools to produce detailed reports of every pupil in the school, also during the June and July period. I fear that schools will go into a period of massive overload and that something will have to give—and that might be the quality of reporting to parents. Before that new measure comes before us, I ask the Minister to consider the time scale and to build in more flexibility so that the work load is spread around the year, giving teachers, governors and head teachers a realistic task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return briefly to Statutory Instrument No. 1502, perhaps the Minister will clarify paragraph 19 of schedule 2 on page 11. The word "average" is used in sub-paragraphs (c) and (f) in relation to examination results. What is meant by "average"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have with me some key stage 3 mathematics tests, with which I am sure the Minister is more than familiar on a page-by-page basis. If he refers to national curriculum documents, he will see that the expression "average", used in relation to youngsters of 12 and 13 upwards, is interpreted as mean, median and mode. Indeed, question four of paper three for tiers 7 to 10 refers to mean, median and mode—not to average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may think that he is a little below average in mathematics—perhaps he will clarify that for the Committee when he speaks—but key stage 3 test for tiers 1 to 4, for youngsters of 14 who are below average, also expects candidates to understand the meaning of the word "mean".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 16 of the test, which includes some rather nice pictures of plants, uses the word "mean". Will the Minister clarify whether, when schools compile tables for him, he expects them to give him the mode result, the median result or the arithmetic mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may say how much I welcome the regulations and look forward to taking a further step in the general direction of making more information on the performance of schools available to parents and to the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the day of the original publication of the secondary schools information statistics, I took a taxi home from the House of Commons. The driver,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
obviously having realised that I was a Member of Parliament, said that he thought that the publication of school results was essential and useful information. He believed that because he thought that he had gone to the worst school in the country and he was delighted to discover that his school in Lambeth was only the second worst in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The publication of results meets the needs of parents and is in the public interest, so it is most important. Overall, the tests are beneficial and I am indebted to the headteacher and teachers at the Downs school in Walmer, who recently took me through the tests in their school. There is no question that some aspects require improvement, and I am delighted that the Government have recognised that. The regulations represent a move forward in several significant ways. I am especially pleased that they cover the publication of results, the determination of examination results particulars and the publication of school prospectuses—all of which will improve the nation's education. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.8 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Sir David, if there is a certain throatiness about my performance today, which is due to more mundane issues than to the power of the oratory heard in Committee during the past half an hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to deal with the points raised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, but I shall commence by saying that the regulations progress two key policies set out in the parents charter—the publication of comparative tables of school performance and the inclusion of more and better information in school prospectuses and governors' annual reports to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw), that the regulations represent a step forward. They will be welcomed by most people outside the House, who will be better informed about the performance of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the comments of the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), in so far as he welcomed some aspects of the regulations. Although he repeated the time-honoured phrase "league tables", he knows that they are performance tables and that they are not published in order of priority but in alphabetical order. I do not want to be combatitive, but the phrase "league tables" does not assist intelligent discussion. The hon. Gentleman should not persist in describing tables that are not linked in order of alleged achievement as league tables. They are performance tables.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dover pointed out that a taxi driver was able to tell from those tables that his old school was not the worst but the second worst in the country. Although the Minister publishes the results in alphabetical order,
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
everyone immediately puts them into order as a league table—in a quite spurious way, considering what sort of results they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will say more about that later. It remains the case that, in the form in which they are required to be published, there is no question of a batting order. How that information is used by newspapers and others is a separate issue. Perhaps it is part of a learning curve—if I may say that in an education context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school performance information regulations oblige the governing bodies of maintained primary and secondary schools, and the proprietors of city technology colleges, to provide—through the maintaining local education authority or direct to the Secretary of State as appropriate—information about national curriculum test results at key stages 1 and 3, results in GSCE and advanced-level examinations and in courses leading to vocational qualifications, and, separately, rates of unauthorised absence. The proprietors of independent schools are subject to the same requirements, except in respect of national curriculum test results, where their audited results will be published only if they choose to submit them for publication. In that, we simply recognise that it is not compulsory for those schools to implement the national curriculum or the assessment arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide also for the distribution of the tables—those for primary schools by local education authorities through public libraries and those for secondary schools by primary schools to the parents of pupils who are due to transfer to secondary school the following year. This year, for the first time, we are publishing separate tables snowing the results of 16 to 18-year-olds in schools and further education sector colleges. Maintained secondary schools will be required—or, if it proves necessary to change this following yesterday's report from the Joint Committee, requested—to distribute these to pupils who are in their final year of compulsory schooling. I assure the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) that I shall comment on that in more detail. All maintained schools will also be obliged to keep copies of relevant tables for their area available for inspection by parents on request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat, that the regulations implement—and, in respect of tables for 16 to 18-year-olds, build upon—the policy that was announced in the parents charter and embodied in the provisions of the Education (Schools) Act 1992. Our belief in the parents' right to know, and our confidence that they share that belief, has been fully vindicated in practice. The 1992 comparative tables of school examination results proved extremely popular—nearly 1.2 million copies were distributed and we are still receiving requests for them. I totally reject any suggestion that parents should in future be denied that basic information about school performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two further important respects in which this year's tables will support our policies of enabling
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
better informed choices to be made and ensuring parity of esteem between vocational and the traditional academic qualifications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being complacent, and perhaps he is misguided about how the tables can be useful. Research by the Institute of Education at the university of London showed that schools that have a good intake and perform well nevertheless do not serve pupils of low ability well, who do very badly. If I were the parent of a child of low ability, I might do my child a disservice by sending him or her to a school that scored highly. It would be better if I had further information telling me how the school copes with children of low ability. Will the Minister do anything about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will comment at greater length in a moment on those points. There should be no broad difference between us about the desirability of measuring those other aspects. The hon. Gentleman's view seems to be that nothing should be published until we agree on precisely what add-on values should be included. Our view is that would be misleading and misguided. It is important to publish the core information. We should work together—I do not seek to be provocative—to find points of agreement, out in the great wide world, including, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, on how schools with a good academic performance cope with pupils of a somewhat lesser ability. I stress that there is no great argument between us on that issue. However, I judge that there is disagreement on the wisdom of publishing now, and we are clear about the advantages of proceeding with that now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thanks to the separate tables for 16 to 18-year-olds, comparative information on the performance of all institutions offering education and training to 16 to 18-year-olds will, for the first time, be available in one place. This will be of key importance in helping 15-year-olds and their parents to make the right choice of course and institution. In addition, secondary school tables will include information on vocational qualifications as well as GCSE and A-level results, and the 16 to 18-year-old tables along with that for A-level results. It is essential to record achievement in that area, to recognise the importance of vocational qualifications for those age groups and to record school, college and student achievements in such qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consulted widely this year as in 1992 on the content of the tables and how they should be prepared and distributed. We listened carefully before reaching the decisions on which the regulations are based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify what he said a moment ago? He spoke about all information on post-16 education being in one place. Does he mean that it will be found in the one institution, or that it will be kept by the local education authority? If parents are looking to make a post-16 choice outside the school that the student attends, will they be able to go to one place for information that may come from
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
two quite different sources—either from a tertiary college or from a separately funded local-authority school for 11 to 18-year-olds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that it is expected that all information about 16 to 18-year-old results will be in the 16 to 18-year-old tables and therefore available at the one location. A parent or a 15-year-old will be able to find out about other schools and colleges in which the pupil could be interested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where in the statutory instrument is the requirement for those establishments to send that information to the local education authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will let me answer that in a moment, especially as it links to one aspect of the Joint Committee report to which the hon. Member for Bradford, South referred—the powers that we may or may not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One major area in which we changed our proposals was the date of publication of the tables on 16 to 18-year-old pupils. We agreed with the majority of the further education colleges that responded that it would make sense to publish them in November, at the same time as secondary school tables. That will ensure that 15 and 16-year-olds have access to information on the full range of options for post-16 study. The decision not to make publication of assessment results compulsory for independent schools similarly took account of views expressed by those consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It had always been our intention to preserve the anonymity of individual pupils when publishing national curriculum assessment results, but here too we were in part responding to comments received in making the provision that we have to preserve that anonymity in relation to the publication of results both in tables and school prospectuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a moment I shall respond to the question asked by the hon. Member for Bridgend. I have no doubt that, in due course, national curriculum test results will form a vital element of the school performance tables. By providing parents and others with that information, we shall make schools more accountable. We shall be able to identify aspects that need improvement or where schools can build on achievement. Parents will be able to make more informed choices on the basis of better information. That will help to raise standards to the benefit of all pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way once more on the issue of the publication of key stage 1 results. I did not refer earlier to research by Leeds university on key stage 1 performance, which found that children from the top three socio-economic levels performed three times better in English and five times better in mathematics than children from the lower three bands. The reverse was true of those performing badly. That research found also that children born in winter were twice as likely to do well as children born
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
in summer. How will the Minister take those findings into account? For example, if by some odd quirk all the pupils of a school were born in winter, that school would be likely to do extremely well. So many variables must be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, the hon. Gentleman is drifting back to value-added and explanatory tables. He is allowed to do that, and I am not against him doing so. However, there must be a starting point and that should be the various examination results. They will provide a pattern, particularly in years to come when the results of tests at seven, 11, 14 and 16 are available. That pattern will enable us to take into account the valid points that the hon. Gentleman has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all seriousness, I submit to the hon. Gentleman that parents want, as a starting point, data on which they can rely. Many if not most parents are capable of making some sort of judgment and of finding such information. It is not a matter of a sudden shaft of light coming in as a result of this proposal. Most parents take an interest in their children's schooling. I am anxious that we do not spend too long discussing that matter, as I want to return to the issues that I was talking about previously. If there has to be a difference between us, so be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say something?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to restrain the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to agree with the Minister and say that, yes, tests and test results do not bring a shaft of light to most communities. Most parents knew and understood what schools were like long before league tables were introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that publication of league table results make it easier for parents to arrive at choices. On that basis, we would need to build a five-lane motorway down to my constituency in the west country and buy a massive new ferry for Penzance, in order to take all the children over to the Scilly Isles, where the results are the best of all. It is nonsense to say that the league table will help parents to make choices. In a town such as Okehampton in Deven there is no real choice except a local school, unless parents have some means of transporting their children 20 or 30 miles elsewhere. The Minister has overstated the value of the publication of the results. Parents who know their local schools are more interested in such matters as the funding of those schools than in crude lists of examination results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That contribution may have highlighted simply that in some places parents will have fewer options than others. The logic of hon. Gentleman's argument is that there should be no publication. The logic of the Government's argument is that that does not invalidate the case, but means simply that many parents will have greater choice—
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
although we concede that in some areas, especially those that are sparsely populated, there may not be such a range of choice. The hon. Gentleman should support publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the question of summer and winter-born children, to which the hon. Member for Bridgend referred, primary school tables will show the percentage of seven-year-olds who have been in primary school for fewer than six terms. We are trying to meet some of the concerns that the hon. Gentleman highlighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the issue that is in the back of most hon. Member's minds, although it has scarcely been referred to today—the current dispute. I regret that dispute, and I believe that it is unprofessional and self-defeating for those involved. It will certainly not aid the long-term development of the assessment and testing arrangements. Its full extent will not be known for some time, but at the end of July we shall have a clearer picture of the tests for seven-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Bridgend, the period for key stage 1 testing runs until four weeks after half term, and many schools have only just finished those tests. I emphasise that governors are responsible for passing on results. Without them, a view cannot be formed about national, local or school standards and, regardless of our different political views, that objective should unite the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remain committed to raising standards throughout the country and I hope that teachers will respond—not least the heads of maintained schools, who are under a duty to pass their schools' test results to their governing bodies for onward transmission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister stressed the desirability of publishing results. If results are so important and there is a nationally valid framework in which to put them, why is the schools examination survey, for which information is still collected, no longer published by his Department? That would have given an overall picture and allowed a connection to be made over a long period. Why did his Department stop publishing that information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply to that point before these proceedings are concluded, or I will write to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked also a general question on the publication in school performance tables of information on unauthorised absence. Responsible head teachers and school governors recognise, as do we all, the importance of tackling unauthorised absence. To date, we have received a high response from schools to the questionnaire seeking the required information. By 14 July, we had received returns from 70 per cent. of English LEA schools and from 75 per cent. of grant-maintained and non-maintained schools. Any individual school whose return remains outstanding, whether because of an incomplete LEA return or a non-maintained school failing to make a return, is being actively pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Our objective in publishing that information in comparative tables is to draw attention to unacceptable variations between schools and to ensure that all schools see the maintenance of high attendance rates as a priority task. I think that events will prove that both parents and the majority of schools support us in that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before coming to the Committee this morning, I was aware that we were bound to discuss value added. Both the hon. Gentleman's speech and subsequent comments covered, to some extent, what I intended to say. Once we are publishing information, as laid down in law, for testing on a consistent scale so that we can start taking judgments, we can at last consider measuring value added—and how what factors should be included in the tables. To the extent that we may be unable to publish some information this year—we are still waiting for quite a lot of information to come in—the possibility of making that calculation and starting that debate has been retarded and not enhanced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To what extent is work being done behind the scenes at the Department for Education to enable the issuing of a consultation paper with specific proposals, on the question of value added?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, subject to exigencies of time, I may be unable to answer the hon. Gentleman now, but I shall willingly write to him with detailed information—he raises an important point. Much of the work so far has been on A-levels and has raised other issues that might not be so relevant to the statutory five to 16-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our hearts are in the right place, but we must be sure of our ground before we introduce value-added measures. In the meantime, parents are entitled to such objective information as we can provide, presented in as straightforward a manner as we can manage. I have a high opinion of the intelligence and common sense of the vast majority of parents in Britain, and am confident that they are as well able to set the information in context and use it sensibly as any employee in the town or county hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations governing the information that governors must publish in their prospectuses and annual reports to parents are rather less contentious. Our objectives are twofold—to ensure that parents have access to as much information as possible when they are thinking about their children's next school, and to keep the burden on schools to a minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked a series of detailed questions by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson). I have much sympathy with his comment that we must strike a balance between the pressure to supply important information and the impact that obligation has on schools. As I shall explain in a moment, I think that we have addressed that issue, especially Statutory Instrument in No. 1503. I shall return later to other detailed questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Schools will be required to publish more hard information about performance in their prospectuses and annual reports next year. That will include, for example, national curriculum test results, data about unauthorised absence, routes taken by pupils over 16 and applications for places in previous years. At the same time, the requirements on schools to publish information about their policies on various organisational matters have been reduced—10 such requirements have been dropped since last year. Schools will, therefore, be freer to decide what to publish, given their own circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is in line with the parents charter commitment to provide more and better information for parents and others. The increased discretion allowed to school governors will minimise the burden placed on them, and will encourage them to publicise those aspects of their school's aims and achievements that they believe will be of most interest to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that the regulations have struck the right balance, and we will be seeking views about school prospectuses from schools and parents alike during the next few months. We shall use the findings to inform our planning for the 1994–95 regulations in due course. That is a dynamic process, but the regulations represent an important step forward in implementing the principles of the parents charter. I shall try to answer the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Devonport, before turning to the important issue raised by the hon. Member for Bradford, South—who remains, helpfully, in the Room. The hon. Member for Devonport asked whether the national average figures on page 2 of Statutory Instrument No. 1502 were relevant to all schools, including independent and grant-maintained schools, CTCs and so on. They do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second question was about the definition of "relevant authority". That is the LEA that is maintaining the school—it is specific to that school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to grant-maintained schools' prospectuses, it is intended that information on all schools, including grant-maintained, will be available to the parents of pupils leaving primary school, and that such information will be available in respect of all schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is the case that "relevant authority" means the LEA—the Minister has assured us of that—could he explain what is meant by regulation 7(4)(b) on page 4, which states that the relevant authority is responsible for distributing information to parents? Sub-paragraph (c) states that copies of that information will be made available at public libraries. If the relevant authority will make information available about the schools that it controls, how will grant-maintained schools make their information available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I am dealing with the hon. Gentleman's earlier questions, perhaps I shall be able to arrange for flashes of insight to reach me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
As to averages, I am tempted to say that I qualified as an accountant and would, therefore, be unlikely to be able to work my way through the mathematics papers of, as the hon. Gentleman said, such complexity. However, I am advised, and it is the logical interpretation, that the averages referred to in the regulations are the straightforward averages about which there is universal understanding. If I need to produce an example of eight figures and average them for the hon. Gentleman, I shall do so—if you, Sir David, will allow that. That is a standard average, which I remember being taught too many years ago for my comfort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister referred to the university of understanding. I thought that the purpose of the national curriculum was to create a university of understanding. The national curriculum refers to averages and clearly divides them into mean, median and mode. That is amply demonstrated by the key stage 3 test that the Department issued earlier this year and which was used by one or two schools this month. That definition is contained in the Department's documentation for children. Is the Minister saying that children should understand one thing, but that governors and head teachers should understand the same thing slightly differently?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Oxford English Dictionary has something to say on this matter. It refers to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"determination. … of an arithmetical mean".</p></blockquote>
However, it also refers to the average being "a medial estimate" which is a medium—"the medium amount".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would help if the Minister told governors and head teachers which average should be used. Perhaps it should be a geometric mean. I could regale the Committee with many more examples. It is a serious point and needs to be clarified. Schools could be compiling results on different basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be spelt out clearly in the circular to governors. The average is the mean. I do not know whether that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. It will be the arithmetic mean. That will be spelt out, to put an end to the engaging concept of governors going into huddles to decide which calculation to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the important point raised by the hon. Member for Bradford, South. He has known me long enough to accept that when I say that the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments performs valuable work, I am not being condescending. That Committee does vital work and it is arguable that Members on both sides of the House do not give it the recognition that it deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information to which the hon. Gentleman referred reached me very recently and I have asked my departmental officials to consider it as a matter of urgency. There was no reason to postpone this debate
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
for the simple reason that, if, in the light of the Committee's report—to which we shall give full consideration—it seems that the powers are defective, we shall make that clear in any note issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the beginning, we shall state that it is a request rather than a requirement. Above all, I assure this Committee that there is no question of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State exercising powers that have not been granted by Parliament. I hope that the hon. Member for Bradford, South will accept that reply in the spirit in which it is given. When I heard the news, my reaction was, I suppose, less than charitable, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and to the Joint Committee for their work in highlighting that problem. We shall of course introduce amending regulations should that prove necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall review the regulations that govern annual reports to parents, following the review being undertaken by Sir Ron Dearing. For obvious reasons, I am unable to refer to that review because I do not know its contents. It will cover questions of work load, and the Government will consider any other changes that flow from it.

I was asked by the hon. Member for Devonport about information on grant-maintained schools and its distribution by LEAs. The document that LEAs must ensure is available in public libraries is the comparative tables document for their area. That will contain information about grant-maintained schools, as well as about independent schools and CTCs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the individual school booklets usually made available by LEAs will not be available for grant-maintained schools? Will he also address the question that he posed himself earlier in respect of post-16 education? Will all the information on tertiary colleges and schools for 11 to 18-year-olds—or 14 to 18-year-olds in some parts of the country—be amassed in the same place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman spends more time in Committees, he will know that assistance is available to the Minister if questions are put to him earlier in the day. Sometimes, divine intervention comes to the Minister's rescue. If, in reading 
	<i>Hansard</i> afterwards, hon. Members find that I have failed to answer any question, I shall write to them. I cannot always answer immediately every question that is asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs will have prospectuses for grant-maintained schools. Therefore, they will be able to use information from those prospectuses and include it in any summaries to be made available in libraries.

The question concerning 16 to 18-year-olds was referred to by the Joint Committee, and at this stage I can only repeat that the intention was that the information would be required to be available. It is possible—I put it no higher than that—that in the

light of the information that we have received from the Joint Committee—that information may be requested rather than required. It is difficult for me to comment further now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate that we accept that the statutory instruments represent an improvement on existing practice, and we welcome that—but the Government could have carried out pilot projects on the best way of assessing school performance without embarking on the existing practice covered by the statutory instruments. It gives scope for the press and so on to malign schools that, on raw results, appear to be doing badly but could in fact be doing reasonably well with the material that they have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
