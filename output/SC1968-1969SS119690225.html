	<i>Question proposed</i> [
	<i>20th February</i>], That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put a question to my hon. Friend of which I have given notice to the Department, namely, what approaches have been made by local authorities who want to take the initiative and exercise their ability to set up museums? It is all very well to talk about the scope and powers that are available for such action, but, unless there is a prospect of these things happening, we are not using our time to the best advantage. I understood the Minister to say that there were no queues of local authorities lining up waiting to exercise these powers, and I would, therefore, like to know what initiatives the Department has had from local authorities over the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that it is probably extremely difficult for organisations and for most local authorities to set up museums and for things like industrial archaeology they will need a good deal of help. To give a concrete example, I think the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright) and others would agree that the shale oil industry and Paraffin Young were a crucial part of the Pumpherston Industrial Revolution not only in Scotland but in Western Europe, and to preserve the vestiges of them—I am not suggesting preservation of all of them—is quite an undertaking for a local authority. Some central Government help is essential if this is to be done. What central Government help
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
is forthcoming to local authorities who take up these powers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly puzzled about the Clause, and I would like to put a point to the Minister. It is rather a difficult one, and I do not ask him necessarily to answer this morning as it comes to him rather unexpectedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree to a large extent with the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) about the need for keeping historical industrial relics—industrial archaeology. My point concerns railways, and in particular old rollingstock and engines. As the Committee will know, there are three museums in England, at Clapham, York and Swindon. The first two were dealt with by the Transport Commission, and the Swindon museum by the Town Council with aid from the railways. All three museums lost money, and I believe that the Department of Education and Science has now taken them over. There are also railway relics in Scotland. There are four or five old engines and some rollingstock which, I believe, are in Glasgow, but I am not sure. There may be other items in other parts of Scotland. Are they in museums, and, if so, who runs them? Is there any intention of putting them under the wing of the Department of Education and Science, and what is their future? I agree with the hon. Member for West Lothian that these items may be too big for local authority museums and that it may be necessary to use central Government powers or facilities. Perhaps the Minister will tell me in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that we are doing under the Clause is to give education authorities powers which they have not had before to run museums. I am not sure whether all the questions put to me are in order, because they open up the whole question of museum facilities of all kinds throughout the United Kingdom. I could not without notice answer the hon. Gentleman's point about the railway museums. I assume that if an education authority, or any other authority in Scotland which had powers to run museums, wanted to preserve relics of the golden age of railways, there is nothing to prevent them from doing so.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
For example, I know that Glasgow Corporation has a transport museum. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to pursue this point, I shall be glad to obtain for him any information that I can, although I am not sure that I have any Departmental responsibility in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) asked whether any education authorities had already shown interest in having these powers. The Bill was discussed with education authorities, and they generally welcomed the additional power which is being provided for them in the Clause, but there are at least two education authorities which are specifically interested in the Clause, Banff and Shetland. No doubt, when the Clause is included in the legislation other local education authorities, as the occasion arises, will be interested in using the powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked whether any Government assistance was available to local museums. There is a limited amount of assistance available. It is administered through the Royal Scottish Museum, which makes available limited amounts of money for the purchase of exhibits, and that money is being taken up. Up until last year it was not being taken up to the full extent of the money available, but within the last year there has been a better take up, and a limited amount of assistance is therefore available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>REPEAL OF SECTION 16 OF EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) ACT 1962</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 25, in page 4, line 26, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>This section shall come into force on such date as the Secretary of State may appoint by an order made by statutory instrument.</p></blockquote>
I intend to be brief, because our apprehensions rest almost entirely on whether or not Section 16 of the 1962 Act should remain and I would like the Minister to say something about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
retention or otherwise of that Section. The Clause seeks to repeal Section 16 which authorises the transfer to a local authority of a denominational school established after November, 1918, to which Section 18 of the 1918 Act would have applied. The purpose of the Amendment is to give the managers of such schools an opportunity to transfer their schools, if they so desire, at a date after the commencement of the Bill, which date the Secretary of State may fix. The purpose is to give the managers of these schools an opportunity before the Clause comes into force to transfer the schools if they so desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me utter a word of warning. We do not want a long general debate on this Amendment because this will be possible on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. We should keep to the specific point of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, Mr. Jennings. I will watch your warning carefully. I can assure you that I shall be dealing only with the question raised by the Amendment. On the other hand, if we obtain a satisfactory answer from the Minister on the Amendment, my objections to the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, will be largely removed. The question of whether schools should have a once for all opportunity of being absorbed within the State system involves a very important and vital safeguard which applies to only a small number of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had correspondence with the Minister over two years about a denominational school for Jewish children in my constituency to which this applies. The school has about 210 pupils. It has been built since the war at a cost of £150,000 and it is called Calderwood Lodge School. It was an act of faith by the Jewish community, who raised £150,000 because they wanted to provide denominational primary education in Glasgow. There are, within the Jewish community, differing views about denominational education, but there is a substantial body of opinion within this community which wants to provide denominational education, as is shown by the substantial donations which have been made and the massive financial campaign within the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
community which has resulted in the provision of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As are many private schools, this school is facing serious financial problems, and if the Amendment were to be accepted, and if the Minister were to give an assurance that he or the Secretary of State would look sympathetically at these pipeline cases, this would remove the objections one would otherwise have to the removal of this safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school charges fees of between £19 and £30 per term, depending on the income and resources of the parents, but, in addition to this, it is necessary to provide a subsidy from the funds of the community of about £50 per annum. Either the school must impose a heavy increase in the fees charged, which would have an effect the opposite to that which the Government are trying to achieve in the area, since it would then cater only for pupils drawn from a limited high income group, or the school may have to be closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two opportunities open to the school; first, to obtain a grant from the local authority or from the Government, and efforts which have been made to do so have up until now failed. The second safeguard is the right enshrined in the 1962 Act, stemming back to legislation in 1897 which was furiously fought out in the famous test case of Bonny-bridge in the 'thirties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think we are getting on to the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. It is very difficult to deal with this Amendment without going into the merits of the Clause as a whole. If you, Mr. Jennings, and the Members of the Committee, were agreeable to this course, we might, perhaps, go a little wide on the Amendment and then either cut out altogether or else shorten the discussion on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. I do not want there to be a repetition of the arguments, but it is difficult for me to answer without giving a little background.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the difficulty. The danger is that there will be a repetition of the arguments. I would be prepared to accept the hon. Member's suggestion, but the other way out would
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
be, if the mover of the Amendment were prepared formally to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment, to give leave for the withdrawal of the Amendment and go straight to the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. I throw that out as a suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a difficulty in as much as if the Minister, on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, insists on the repeal of Section 16, there will be no opportunity for any independent school at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well. I will accept the first suggestion, that I allow the Committee to go a little wide on the Amendment, on the promise that there will not be repetition of the arguments on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. Just proceed as you were, Mr. Taylor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My difficulty is the same as that of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan). If we could have an assurance that the Minister will be sympathetic, and that the Secretary of State for Scotland will sympathetically interpret the Clause, there would no need for me, nor, indeed, for any other Member of the Committee, to say anything further on the Amendment. If we could have an assurance from the Minister that he would be sympathetic to this and that the Secretary of State, who is the only person with the power to agree to transfers, would also be sympathetic on pipeline cases such as the one in my constituency, I would not want to add another word. However, if this were the case, the Minister would already have intervened and told me that there was no point in my continuing. In the absence of such an indication, may I explain a little further exactly what is involved? If the Minister intends to be sympathetic to the Amendment, and if he could give an assurance that the Secretary of State would sympathetically interpret his responsibility, then I will sit down now and say not another word. But he is shaking his head, so I shall have to go on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter goes back to the Act of 1897, and it is a vital safeguard for those concerned with the future of denominational education, since, under it, any local authority can set up such schools. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
a vital safeguard for minorities who want a school provided when this is resisted by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of us will have received a letter from the Archbishop of Glasgow, Archbishop Scanlan, in which he expresses serious concern. He says that the Secretary of State's consent is required for the transfer of these schools but that some local authorities are reluctant to provide denominational schools in accordance with Section 17(2) and that to provide for the growing Catholic population it has been necessary on occasions for the Church authorities to provide a school for local needs. Church authorities and denominational minorities have provided their own schools in some cases. The Catholic community has done this and, in my own constituency, the Jewish community has done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Amendment is rejected and the Minister cannot give this assurance, this very expensive school, provided entirely by voluntary efforts and supported by the Glasgow community, although not necessarily within the city's territorial boundaries, will have to increase its fees, thus drawing children from a smaller income group, or even have to consider its whole future. When there is such a substantial feeling that any denomination provides such a school, the local authority and the Government should at least give help and support. The Amendment can apply only to circumstances where the community has gone to great trouble and financial sacrifice, as in the case with Calderwood Lodge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause was introduced partly, I believe, because of the long correspondence which I have been having with the Minister over two years. In 1967, when we were discussing the school to which this provision directly relates, the Minister said that the school did not come under this definition. Our friends on the Board of Governors obtained counsel's opinion, to the effect that the school was covered by this safeguard. In the absence of a sympathetic response from the Minister we asked Glasgow Corporation for some financial assistance, but, unfortunately, it decided not to give it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, on 14th February, 1968, the Governors wrote to the Corporation saying:
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In view of this refusal we feel that it is only right to inform you that it is more than likely that, at some future date, we shall be submitting a formal request for transfer."</p></blockquote>
A formal request for transfer, which the hon. Member is seeking to preserve in pipeline cases, will mean that the Secretary of State can insist that the local authority shall accept this school in its educational system. This is what the Governors said they would do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my reply, I said that the counsel's opinion strengthened the Governors' hand, and that my only fear was that any attempt to take advantage of this Section might result in new legislation to overturn it. We are told that the future financial safeguard which we wanted is not on, then obtain counsel's opinion that it is on, and then the Government bring in a new Clause to remove this right and put at risk the future of this school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this respect, one thinks mainly of denominational schools, often with Catholic pupils, but now there is this further development of the Jewish schools. The Secretary of State for Education and Science himself recently attended the formal opening of such a school in England and said that these developments should be integrated. There is also the possibility, with the extension of Scotland's immigrant population, of some other minorities seeking schools of their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member does not ask that this right should continue for all time, but I think that it should, because the public purse is safeguarded, since these matters will be subject to the opinion of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To which case is the hon. Gentleman referring, when my right hon. Friend made those remarks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot quote the case. I mentioned it on the basis of a telephone call which I had last night from one of the governors of this school, a very honourable man, who said that he had it on the information of some of his friends who were at the opening of that school. I will certainly get on the 'phone during the morning and supply this information——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is this a private arrangement between the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
or will the information which he proposes to give my hon. Friend be given to the whole Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly let it be known to the whole Committee in some way, if that is wanted. I hope that it is clear that I am not trying to mislead the Committee and that the governors of this school are most honourable people. They said that a similar school was opened in England, in the presence of the Secretary of State, who gave his support to the concept of denominational education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the Amendment, this school will have to increase fees. One argument is that the pupils are not just from the Glasgow area and that, if the Glasgow Corporation took over, the question of outside fees would not necessarily arise. But the future of Scottish local government is under review and boundaries may be revised to take a larger area into Glasgow, which would be of great interest. We are discussing the right of people who feel so strongly about denominational education that they set up their own schools. The removal of this Section of the 1962 Act will prevent them from having their schools taken into the local education authority system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the governors have said that they want to take advantage of this Section it is wrong that the Government should remove this right. The hon. Member for West Lothian is active on behalf of his constituents. How would he feel, if, after two years of correspondence about the interpretation of a Section and rights of some of his constituents, when he seemed to be winning the case and had counsel's opinion to support him, the Minister brought forward a Bill to change the law? I hope that the Minister can at least say that, in this case and other pipeline cases, he will allow this to continue and interpret his responsibilities sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can foresee some difficulty over interpretation of the width of treatment of this Amendment. May I suggest—and I would not press the suggestion if the Committee did not agree—that we could still keep within the technical structure of the rules of order if we discussed the Amendment but incorporated with it the wide type of consideration which is evidently desired, and which would be given on the Question,
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
That the Clause stand part of the Bill? If I allow wide discussion on the Amendment, so as to save time and repetition, we could then take formally the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. In other words, we could on the Amendment have a wide discussion of the Clause, and the later Question could be decided without further debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see no difficulty in the Minister allowing his views to be known, when the type of speech which we would make after his speech might be totally different. I moved my Amendment very briefly so that I could hear the Minister's views, but, if he resists, I may have to take a totally different view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it would help the Committee, I am willing to speak now, without seeking to prevent other hon. Members from speaking after me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will adopt that course. Mr. Millan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the issue will be clearer when I have said something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the question of whether we should retain Section 16 of the 1962 Act rather than the Amendment. We are talking about the same thing. We should be clear what Section 16 does. It provides for the transfer from the owners or trustees to an education authority of a denominational school established after 2nd November, 1918, to which Section 18 of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918, would have applied had the school existed on that date. The Secretary of State has to give his consent and the authority is bound to accept the transfer. I emphasise the point that the authority is bound to accept the transfer. In other words, Section 16 is to provide for cases in which the managers of a denominational school can compel an education authority to take over their school when they are unwilling, provided that they get the consent of the Secretary of State. This answers the point about Calderwood Lodge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to go into details about that particular school, as the hon. Gentleman has done, although, as he knows, I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
very familiar with them, and we have had correspondence about them. The only point I would make is that the repealing of Section 16 will in practice make no difference at all to the case of Calder-wood Lodge because the Secretary of State has already taken a decision in that matter. That decision will be maintained. There will be no question of the Secretary of State's compelling Glasgow education authority to take over Calderwood Lodge school when they are unwilling so to do. We have said to the managers of that school that if they are able to persuade Glasgow education authority to take over the school and include it as part of the denominational provision for the city, then there is no reason for the Secretary of State to object. But we shall certainly not compel Glasgow education authority under Section 16 to take over a school when it does not want to do so. That seems to be an excessive use of the Secretary of State's powers and, in any case, is exercised under a Section which is not appropriate to the circumstances of 1969.

Section 16 applies to schools to which Section 18 of the 1918 Act would have applied had the school been in existence at that date. In other words, one of the tests the Secretary of State has to apply to the school is whether, if it had been in existence 51 years ago, it would have been the kind of school which would have been covered by a particular Section of the 1918 Act. This is an absurd kind of judgment to make, because schools have changed very considerably since 1918. In fact this goes back beyond 1918 to 1897.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scotch Education Code—I repeat the words, "Scotch" Education Code—as it was at that time, was in entirely different terms from what we understand by education in 1969. For example, it did not apply to secondary schools offering a full five-year course. However one looks at this matter, one is unable in practice to make a judgment that a school in existence today would have been a particular type of school to which the Code would have applied if it had been in existence 51 years ago. Therefore, the Secretary of State is not willing, and I cannot imagine any Secretary of State being willing, on the basis of this impossible judgment to compel an education authority to take over a school which it does not wish to
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
take over. If there is agreement between the managers and the education authority then no difficulty arises, and the Secretary of State is unlikely to stand in the way of a transfer, but I repeat that no Secretary of State, as I assess the position at the moment—neither the present Secretary of State nor any in the future—would be likely to compel a transfer under Section 16 of the 1962 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as we can see at this late stage it is fairly clear that the terms of Section 18 of the 1918 Act were intended to be transitional provisions to lapse after two years. This was something temporary to deal with cases in the pipeline in 1918, but the provision has never been repealed and it has carried right through until 1969. It was meant to deal with transitional cases. For many years there has been no transfer under Section 16. In fact, our records do not go back far enough to enable me to say definitely when the last transfer took place under Section 16 of the 1962 Act. There has been no transfer since 1962; so far as I can trace there has been no transfer as far back as 1950. I suspect that the last transfer under Section 16 took place many years before that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that answers the point which was put by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan). There are no cases in the pipeline to which Section 16 would be appropriate at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is apart from the case of Calderwood Lodge where, as I have already made clear, the Secretary of State has taken a decision, namely, that the managers should go back and discuss it with the education authority. The decision is that the Secretary of State will not compel the education authority to take over the school if the education authority is unwilling so to do. We have put it back to the managers, and, as I made clear in the correspondence with my hon. Friend, they must go back and discuss it with the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be proper for this Committee to go over the correspondence in this particular case. I have told the hon. Gentleman that the initiative must rest with the governors and the education authority. If I have gone slightly further than I have said in any letter to him, I am only stating that I do not believe that in this case the Secretary of State will take a decision to compel the transfer of this school to the Glasgow Education Authority, if that authority is unwilling. Therefore, the Clause will make no difference at all in relation to Calderwood Lodge. The Clause is not a breach of faith in dealing with any case which may be the subject of correspondence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Committee to be clear about the situation of denominational schools provided for the Roman Catholic community. So far as I am aware, under Section 16 there have been no recent transfers of Roman Catholic schools; there are no such Roman Catholic schools in the pipeline at present. If my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn is able to produce examples of schools which are likely to be transferred under Section 16 of the Act, I shall be willing to consider them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Frank McCormick, who acts for the Archdiocese of Glasgow, says in his letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is also understood that this Section was used in connection with the transfer of two schools within the Archdiocese of Edinburgh to the local education authorities. These schools are believed to be in St. Andrews and in Cupar, Fife."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the dates, but I should be very surprised if they were Section 16 transfers. Section 16 relates to transfers under an arrangement by which the education authority is bound to accept a school with the consent of the Secretary of State, however unwilling it may be otherwise to accept it—as opposed to transfers under Section 17 of the 1962 Act which is the normal way in which denominational schools are transferred to local education authorities. I wish to set at rest any fears of my hon. Friend, for it is not intended by the Bill to make any difference to the existing position of denominational transfers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general proposition is that where at present Roman Catholic schools are
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
transferred to education authorities—that is, after having been provided otherwise than by the education authority itself—the matter is covered in practice by Section 17 of the 1962 Act, not by Section 16. Section 17 provides specifically for schools which are built for the Roman Catholic community; subsection (2) of the Section provides specifically for new schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also advised that Section 17(2) can provide for cases where, for example, a non-denominational school is converted into a denominational school, as sometimes happens in urban areas in the process of reorganisation. It sometimes happens in Glasgow. As to the cases where a denominational school has been provided other than by the education authority, that is provided privately, perhaps in anticipation of a build-up——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman clear up one point? He referred to Section 17(2) of the 1962 Act, which is, as I read it, a permissive provision. Would it cover the case where the local authority was reluctant, or indeed refused, to set up a denominational school to serve the educational needs of a minority in the area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. At the moment I was seeking to cover all the cases. First of all, I covered the case of new provision under Section 17(2). I covered another situation where the Roman Catholic authorities are rather doubtful, and the case where a non-denominational school is converted into a denominational school, as sometimes happens in the City of Glasgow at primary level, when there is a shifting population. I am advised that that case can be covered by Section 17(2) of the 1962 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third type of case, and the one with which I will now deal, is the case of a school provided outside the education authority structure by the denomination itself. Normally in the case of the Roman Catholic community, in the few cases where that happens at present, it is in anticipation of the build up of the Catholic population to the extent that a Roman Catholic school can then be provided by the local education authority. When the community has reached that level, in the few cases where it arises, then either the education authority can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>347</span>
take over the school under Section 17(2) or else—this happens just as often—the education authority by the same subsection can agree to provide new accommodation for the Catholic community or denomination concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 17(2) does not cover the case where the local education authority is unwilling to provide a denominational school. I do not believe there will be circumstances in which a Secretary of State at present, under Section 16, would compel an education authority to accept a school of a denominational type which that education authority does not wish to accept. So far as the Catholic community is concerned I am not aware of any case of any education authority in Scotland refusing to provide a school for the Catholic community when that community is sufficiently large to sustain a school in the locality. Therefore I do not believe that in practice this problem arises so far as the Roman Catholic community is concerned. I am not aware of any instance where it has arisen, and if there is such an instance I should be glad to hear of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My information is that such a case did arise in 1930 in Stirlingshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was in 1933.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were also two cases mentioned by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan), one in Edinburgh and one in Fife. I think we should know whether or not those were Section 16 schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has mentioned the case in 1930, but that was 39 years ago. It may just have been possible then to make this judgment whether the school would have been one to which the Scotch Education code would have applied in 1918, but it is impossible to make such a judgment in 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, I do not envisage circumstances in which any Secretary of State would now compel an education authority to take over a denominational school. None has been taken over in recent years. I am willing to look at examples, but I am not aware of any schools having been
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
transferred under Section 16 for many years. It was meant to be a transitional provision in 1918 but it does not apply in 1969. I am not aware of any difficulty with regard to the provision of schools for Roman Catholic children by any education authority in Scotland where the community is of such number that a school should be provided. I believe that to be common ground between me and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Spring-burn. I cannot imagine the Secretary of State using his powers under Section 16 to compel an unwilling education authority to accept a denominational school which is privately provided, and I cannot imagine that if he were to use these powers the circumstances in which the school would transfer to the authority would be happy ones for the children or the teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore Section 16 it out of date and it is undesirable to retain it. If one wanted to make some provision that in certain circumstances the Secretary of State should step in and compel an education authority to do something it does not want to do, it would have to be by a completely new Clause which would be appropriate to 1969 and not in terms of retaining Section 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have ranged fairly wide in order to explain the background to this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman indicating that he would be prepared to come forward with an appropriately worded new Clause at Report stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because I do not think it would be right at the present time for the Secretary of State to take power to compel the education authority to accept a denominational school. Which is unlikely to be a Catholic one in the circumstances of the day because Roman Catholic schools are provided in the existing situation. I am saying that if any hon. Gentleman thinks there is a case for doing that it would have to be done, in my opinion, by a completely new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, may I say that in the last few minutes I have been given the information that the schools in Fife mentioned by my hon. Friend were in fact transferred under Section 17(2) of the 1962 Act, and Section 16 was not applied at all. I do not know of any case of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0640">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
Section 16 being applied, and although it may appear to be some kind of protection, in practice it is no protection at all and it is extremely unlikely ever to be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not happy about the Minister's reply because he indicated that at present he can envisage no circumstances in which any Secretary of State would be willing to use these [ILL]wers. In that case why does he think this Section was put into the 1962 Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a consolidation Act. The Section was simply brought forward. I believe a more appropriate question would be why it survived in 1946, rather than why it survived in 1962.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that there is a reason which the Minister has not mentioned. The main reason why this is here and why some of us would like to retain it is that, whether or not the Secretary of State would want to use these powers, or would intend to use them, it is a useful protection for denominational schools in negotiations with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the governors of a denominational school ten or twenty years from now were to be asked whether they would be willing to enter into negotiations for transfer, if they did not have this provision, they would have no protection and no weapons in their armoury for negotiations. I wonder what the hon. Gentleman is worrying about? If he says that the Secretary of State is not prepared to use this power even in the most extreme circumstances, why not leave the Section there? I suggest the value of this Section to denominational schools is that it gives them a weapon in their armoury whereby, if a local authority is unreasonable—and I am not suggesting that anyone is unreasonable at the present time—or if a local authority is being foolish—and I am not suggesting that either—the governors of a school would have a protection. They could say, "If we do not have reasonable negotiations we shall be able to go to the Secretary of State, explain the circumstances, and ask him if he would be willing to intervene." I am not suggesting that these circumstances have arisen in Glasgow or anywhere else, but I believe this to be the only protection available to denominational schools at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
What is the present procedure on negotiations? Section 16 lays down how negotiations on a transfer can be ascertained, and the Secretary of State can intervene in the actual mechanics of the transfer. If this Section is taken away, what protection have the school governors? Under Section 17 they have no protection at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has asked whether we cannot find some other machinery in order to allay his fears. Admittedly I have been influenced by the letter received from Archbishop Scanlan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to this one case, which happens to be in the constituency of Cathcart, the school serves a wide area and I know that in the discussions which the school governors hoped to have with the Corporation of Glasgow they were unfortunately aware of the fact that the Minister had already indicated his unwillingness to operate this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest this is a useful safeguard, and probably the reason why there have not been many transfrs in the last few years is, firstly, because local authorities have been reasonable and, secondly, because this has been a weapon available to the governors of denominational schools. I would suggest with respect that if the Minister insists on rejecting this Amendment, and if he will not listen to observations, he is removing the only meagre protection which is available, to probably a tiny number of schools, but is a protection to which they are entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be that the majority of people in a place might not want to have a Roman Catholic or a Jewish school, but the whole point of the Section was to give some protection to minorities in local authority areas. Is the Minister saying that if a local authority refuses point blank to provide something which is wanted by a minority only there are no circumstances in which he would intervene? If that is so I suggest it is wrong. What he is in fact saying is that the prospect for a denominational school should be decided by the majority of the council, the education authority or the people. There are minorities who want denominational schools, and the whole purpose of this is to give them some protection. We are not asking that a law should be passed to enable any group
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
to have a school, or that all the existing schools should be taken over. We are simply asking that those few schools at the present time which may be affected should have some means of bargaining. The Minister has said that he would never use it, but some future Secretary of State might use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply the Minister gave the impression that I, and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) and others were seeking to force local authorities to do things they did not want to do. In ultimate circumstances this could arise, but to be realistic, at present the only difference it makes is to give these denominational schools some small help. I know that the directors and the board of Calderwood Lodge would like to feel that at the end of the day there is a court of appeal. This provision does not force the Secretary of State or any education authority to do anything at all: ii simply gives him the right, in certain extreme circumstances, to take some action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope he will reconsider his position and at least find a new form of words or a new Clause that will not leave these schools utterly defenceless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think it would be better if we had our full debate on the Amendment and on the Clause together,
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>

We went back to the 1940s, 1930s, 1918, formal pre-record history, and one wonders on earth, why. I would like to commend to my hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a bit of a quandary. I appreciate what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, every word of which was true, but in public speeches up and down the country I have called the Education Act, 1918, the Magna Charta of Catholic education in Scotland and I pay a tribute here to the broadmindedness of non-denominational men and women and denominational men and women on both sides who saw in that Act something to save us from many tribulations existing not far from here at the moment. Prior to 1918—and Members must try to understand the feelings of Archbishop Scanlan and his advisers—it was not easy for Roman Catholic education to exist in Scotland to any degree. It had to be privately supplied and at great cost. Even after 1918 we, nevertheless had the 1933 case which had to go to the House of Lords. I will not quote the judgment, which I have here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) bears out what the Under-Secretary said. A new community is developing in Bishop-briggs and the Catholic community have to put up a private school there. When the private school is built the local education authority fulfil its obligations and take over and complete the new school. That is under Section 17(2). There are no complaints that this is how the Act is working. It is greatly appreciated. However, in Scotland at present politics are in a turbulent state and in the

	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
last four or five years not only turbulence but irresponsibility has entered Scottish politics and this irresponsibility is likely to get an even tighter grip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point made by the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor). I do not see what the Under-Secretary has to lose in giving way on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I would be terribly apprehensive at present of repealing Section 16 and I urge my hon. Friend to reconsider it.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we should be careful not to give the impression outside that there is deep religious controversy in Scotland. That is not the case. There were difficulties before 1918, and even greater difficulties long before that. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) said that it was difficult for Roman Catholic education to survive, but 200 years earlier it was difficult for Roman Catholics to survive, let alone their schools. Over the years there has been a growth in religious tolerance, and we do not need to debate that today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned now whether or not Section 16 should be retained in the 1962 Act and I want to direct my remarks not so much to the Amendment, which was moved so well by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Springburn, but rather to the general principle of this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difficulty which the Minister described. He pointed out to us that, for Section 16 to take effect, the Secretary of State has to satisfy him-
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
self that the school in question is one to which the Scottish Education Code would have applied in 1918, and that the more years pass the more difficult it is for the Secretary of State to think back to what the circumstances might have been in 1918. But that is not the point. The question we are concerned with is much more the matter of principle. It is not so much whether that school comes within the Scottish Education Code, as it applied in 1918, but whether or not there should be this educational protection for the principle of denominational education in circumstances where a rift or a disagreement exists between the denomination in question and the local education authority. It is largely irrelevant for the hon. Gentleman to parade the Scottish Education Code as an excuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I accept that the existence of Section 16(1) is something of a hurdle. It surely would be possible on Report for the Under-Secretary to come forward with a new Clause providing the protection which Section 16 provides. That would meet completely the case made from both sides this morning. I do not think the 1918 argument has much substance. The hon. Gentleman was helpful in calling attention to Section 17 of the 1962 Act, and he ran through the circumstances in which the future of a denominational school would be safeguarded in one way or another. However, what remains is the possible case of a denominational school which is in danger. I accept the Under-Secretary's argument that it is unlikely in modern times that a dispute of this kind would arise between a religious denomination and a local education authority. It is unlikely, and it will become more and more so as tolerance increases, but it is not impossible, and that is the point at issue. It is possible that at some stage in the future there may be irritation, as in Stirlingshire in the 1930 case, or as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Springburn said, the 1933 case. It may be——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole point about the 1933 case was that the Department had given consent to a transfer. It was the education authority that was resisting it. The Bonnybridge case is therefore, not relevant to 1969.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, it is very relevatnt to the argument. The central point of that dispute, as I understand it, was the disagreement between the sides, the Governors of the denominational school, I suppose, and the local education authority, and if those circumstances were to be repeated in future there would now be no court of appeal, as it were, for the denomination in question. I cannot understand why the Under-Secretary wants to remove this ultimate protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said it was unlikely that recourse would have to be had in future to Section 16 or to a revised version of the Section omitting recourse to the 1918 requirement, but it is possible that this will happen. We know that before many years have passed the structure of local government in Scotland will be substantially changed. None of us yet knows what new pattern will emerge from this. We do not know what sort of political circumstances will affect the composition of this new pattern of local government. We all want to see greater mobility of labour in Scotland, and we are at one in wanting to see areas of the Highlands rehabilitated, and in wanting to see greater variety of employment for people, great growth of new towns and development of new areas with new factories springing up. All this will mean greater movement of people an Scotland, and, I hope, into Scotland, than in the past. This will put all sorts of strains on the local authorities and the education structure. Perhaps I am painting the picture with rather vivid strokes of the brush, but, nevertheless, it is possible that these things will happen, and, because it is possible, it is right that the law should take account of the possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we believe that these things may happen in the future we can add to that the certainty that in some areas of Scotland the Roman Catholic population is likely to grow. I accept that it is likely that the education authority will make provision for this, but in the Archbishop's letter there is a clear indication that at some time there has been disagreement with local authorities about the provision of denominational education. The letter makes it clear, if there is the slightest doubt about it. If there is any feeling that a clash could arise with a minority, and that they might not be able to secure from the local education authority, edu-
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
cation in their religion for their children, this ultimate power should be retained in this Bill, and not struck out of the 1962 Act altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Under-Secretary that it is highly unlikely this power would ever have to be used, but I remind him of the point rightly made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) that it is not so much the calling into operation of the Section that matters but the fact that the power exists. There are many areas of planning, not least of strategic planning, where the existence of a weapon or a power is what matters, much more than the use of that weapon or power. If the Secretary of State were to want to show that in the end he would have the resolve to intervene on the side of justice and religious tolerance, should such a dispute arise, he would have the right.

It is unlikely that this Section would need to be brought into effect. What we cannot judge, however, is the influence on negotiation which this protection can provide. In view of the uncertainties ahead of us, I believe it is absolutely right that legislation should take account of the possibility that, despite the growth of tolerance, there may yet in the future be people who would not shrink from squeezing out a minority because it dared to be different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I again make a point which, although I have made it already on several occasions, does not seem to have gone home. There is no protection in Section 16 of the 1962 Act because the Section is so completely out of date. It is an absurd argument to admit that the Section is out of date, and that it is unlikely ever to be used in practice, but say that it must be retained because it has some sort of protection in a negotiating sense. That is a complete absurdity. Section 16 is out of date in every sense.

I do not want to go into detail about the Calderwood Lodge School. So far as I recollect the details of my correspondence which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor), I did not deal with whether or not it would be possible to bring Calderwood Lodge within the ambit of Section 16 in any case, even if the Secretary of

State were willing to compel the education authority to take over the school, which it was unwilling to do. It would be virtually impossible in 1969 to bring any existing school within the ambit of Section 16, because that Section was in terms which were relevant to 1918 and not relevant to 1969. The only way in which Calderwood Lodge, or any other school, could get the protection of Section 16 would be to have an organisation, an administration and a curriculum which were relevant to 1918 and not relevant to 1969.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is aware that I have in my possession—and I have given the gist of it—counsel's opinion, of James Mackay, dated 25th October, 1967? After going fully into this, he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For these reasons I am of opinion that if Calderwood Lodge Primary School had been in existence in 1918, it would have fulfilled the necessary requirements and Section 16 of the Act of 1962, applies to it."</p></blockquote>
This was obtained at considerable expense and trouble, and I shall be only too glad to give a copy to the Minister and anybody else who is interested.

The Secretary of State for Education and Science was reported by the

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a long intervention, and it is mostly irrelevant to what we are discussing. It is not for me to say what the Secretary of State for Education in England may have said about Jewish schools or about anything else. I am simply making the point that, as a matter of practice, it is extremely unlikely that any school at the present time could be brought within the ambit of Section 16 of the 1962 Act, in any case, and there is, therefore, no protection.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a private fee-paying school, but I do not wish to continue a long argument about Calderwood Lodge. Apart from anything else, it would not be fair to the managers of the school to have their affairs debated in Committee as we have been doing this morning. I have already said enough about it. I mentioned it originally because I wanted to make it absolutely clear that there is no question of the provision in this Bill representing a breach of faith while negotiations are going on about Calderwood Lodge. I said earlier that the Bill makes no difference in practice to what is likely to happen to the Calderwood Lodge School.

If it is the feeling among certain Members of the Committee—and I ask them to consider very deeply the implications before they commit themselves to this view—that there should be provision in our legislation to allow the Secretary of State to compel an unwilling education authority to take over a denominational school, then that had better be stated explicitly instead of reliance being placed upon a Section which is in practice completely out of date and very unlikely to be used. That is a different argument, and I would take the view that it would be a major mistake to put such a provision in our legislation. I cannot imagine anything that would more damage the relationships between education authorities and the Roman Catholic authorities, granted that the existing position works satisfactorily, than to

I suppose that in the next Education Bill in ten years from now, if we leave the Section in, the argument will be that it should be left in once again, although it has not been used in the intervening ten years, simply because there are some completely unsubstantiated suspicions that the removal of the Section would remove some protection.

I have asked explicity to be presented with cases in which Section 16 has provided a protection, and there are not any. If my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thank you, Mr. Jennings, for suggesting that grouping, with which I agree completely. The Amendments appear to be drafting Amendments. There is more to them than that, but I agree that it would be for the general convenience to take them together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the very start of our proceedings several weeks ago my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) described Clause 1 as a dog's breakfast. I can only describe this Clause as a dog's dinner. Far too little thought has been given to its drafting, and much too little consideration to the confusion which arises if one marries Clause 4 with Section 19 of the 1962 Act. With a sad shaking of the head, my hon. Friends and I decided that this point was one at which we must intervene to try to assist the Government in their drafting. I do not claim that our drafting corrections are entirely correct, but I am sure that the Minister will not make too much of that. The purpose of the Amendments is to call attention to the muddle which, I believe, Clause 4 will create. The argument which I shall advance is, I am afraid, rather a complicated one. The complication reflects the difficulty which arises when one tries to marry Clause 4 and Section 19. However, I will do my best to try to make the argument as simple as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of Clause 4 leads to a lack of consistency. Section 19 (1) will be removed and a new subsection introduced, but it will have a different description of the variety of educational establishments from that already contained in subsections (3), (4) and (5) of Section 19 of the 1962 Act, where there are repeated references to
	<br><blockquote><p>"school, junior college or other educational establishment".</p></blockquote>
In the original Act, that simply repeated the "preamble" of subsection (1) but that is now to disappear and an inconsistency presents itself. This is a small point, but it shows the sloppy drafting of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important, Clause 4 seems to have been drawn with no regard to the consequences of events under Sections
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
19 and 20, the first of which sets out requirements as to premises of educational establishments, while the second provides power for educational authorities to acquire land, erect and furnish buildings and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 (2) refers to the limitation of land use by a local education authority and prohibits it from acquiring land for:
	<br><blockquote><p>"use as the site of an educational establishment, or of playing fields to be used in connection with such an establishment, or of an extension to any such establishment or playing fields …. without the approval of the Secretary of State given in writing before such acquisition or commencement …"</p></blockquote>
I do not want to discuss the Tightness or wrongness of that proposition, but this limitation of the powers of a local education authority is being introduced at the wrong place in the Bill. If it is to be introduced, it should surely be as an Amendment to Section 20. The power to acquire land appears there, and not in Section 19. That is why Amendment No. 16 removes Clause 4 (2) from Section 19 to Section 20. This makes for common sense and consistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the removal under Clause 4, of an element of discretion from Section 19 (2). If that discretion is removed, part of the remaining provisions do not make sense. For example, if subsection (2) is to disappear, surely subsection (3) should also disappear. If the Secretary of State is to be empowered instead to make regulations without any discretion remaining to the local authority, why retain subsection (3), which requires that an educational authority shall secure that any premises or equipment should conform to the standards applicable? The new, revised Section 19 would then start by giving total powers to the Secretary of State and provide that a local education authority must conform with them—but that is totally superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an inconsistency in that the phrase "general requirements" in Clause 4(1) hangs out on a limb when introduced in Section 19, because the general requirements do not reappear. Section 19(3), if it is to survive, does not follow this phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These changes in Clause 4 have not been sufficiently thought out. Part of them apply to the wrong Section. I hope that the Under-Secretary will agree to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
make sense of this and present it again on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's last point, about Clause 19(3), that is amended in Schedule 2, where he will see that the wording of the complete Section 19, as it will be, makes sense. This is rather complicated, and I do not criticise the hon. Gentleman for not having noticed subsequent Amendments in the Schedule. Amendments of substance are in the body of the Bill, minor and consequential Amendments are in Schedule 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On his main point, whether part of the new requirement under Clause 4 should be inserted in Section 19 or Section 20, I need not argue at length, because there are arguments on either side. On balance, he is probably right and it would be better to put the appropriate provision in Section 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His Amendments are defective, but I will not waste time by going through the reasons why. However, if he will withdraw them, I will put down Amendments on Report to meet his main aim, which is to make the insertion of the new provision in Section 20 rather than Section 19. With that undertaking, and since I accept his main points and have answered his subsidiary ones, I hope that he will withdraw the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend asks leave to withdraw the Amendment, may I ask one question? I have looked at Schedule 2. Why is the hon. Gentleman retaining the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"schools, junior colleges and other educational establishments"</p></blockquote>
in that amendment, while, in the amendment in the main part of the Bill, he refers just, I think, to "educational establishments"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of consistency, I will consider that before making my Amendments on Report. The 1962 Act contains many references to junior colleges. There have not been any and I do not expect there to be any, but we felt that it was probably undesirable to eliminate all these references, since they would have removed provisions for compulsory further education which any future Government might wish to activate, The consolidating legislation, when we have a consolidation Bill, will still contain
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
these references, so it is necessary to refer to them in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) mentioned the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"schools, junior colleges or other educational establishments"</p></blockquote>
which appears in subsections (3), (4) and (5) of Section 19 of the 1962 Act, not all of which will remain, I accept. But this no longer conforms with the revised version of subsection (1). I also mentioned the effect of the phrase "general requirements" in Clause 4 and I take it that the hon. Gentleman will look at that——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman called my attention to an error of fact which arose from my inadequate study of Schedule 2. I am grateful to him, and I withdraw that small part of my speech, but this emphasises the difficulty for hardworking people of trying to study the Bill. Schedule 2 contains eight and a half pages and 40 paragraphs, many involving more than one amendment to the 1962 Act. It is extraordinarily complicated for people interested in education to jump around between the 1962 Act, the body of the Bill and the Schedule. It is a dog's dinner, and will lead to substantial indigestion for many dogs who must eat the meal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the hon. Gentleman's assurance that a consolidation Measure will be considered will lead to early action. I am obliged to him for accepting my main argument. We will look forward with pleasure and eagerness to his Amendments on Report. The defects of ours are inescapable because of our limited resources, but they have served to make the point.

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause gives the Secretary of State power to make Regulations prescribing standards and general requirements which will apply to premises occupied by educational establishments. I hope that the Secretary of State, when drawing up Regulations, will have regard to the standard of school playing fields. On many occasions hon. Members have expressed their displeasure at the quality of playing fields, and I hope that consideration will be given to this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In lines 34 and 35, on page 4, one sees the words "different standards or requirements". There are undoubtedly different standards as between old buildings and the new ones which are going up. These standards have a considerable effect on the environment in which children are being educated. Should we not concentrate more on bringing the old schools up to a better standard?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1967 Regulations relating to standards were in many ways very good, but they rather carried on the previous Regulations of 1959. Local authorities undoubtedly find difficulty in providing new places in schools within the cost per place laid down by these Regulations. They face the increased costs as a result of devaluation and S.E.T. Local authorities are being squeezed, and it would be undesirable to cut down the available area for classes and assembly halls. It would be equally undesirable to use cheaper materials or to put up shoddy buildings. Education authorities build as cheaply as they reasonably can, but I should be sorry if local authorities, owing to increased costs, were squeezed either into cutting down on space or into using cheaper materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
One of the chief priorities for the Government should be to replace old and unsatisfactory schools which exist all over Scotland. This has a great effect on the education of children in such schools. Possibly at the moment we are laying too much emphasis on buildings for comprehensive education. In any case, we should put the emphasis on building for comprehensivisation where the existing buildings need replacing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of buildings required for the raising of the school-leaving age. I should be interested to know the Government's intentions and priorities in this matter. Priority at the moment should be given to buildings for primary education. One knows that, because of financial stringency, there have been considerable cuts in the programme for 1968–69 and 1969–70.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Minister's thoughts about keeping up the standard of school building within the 1967 Regulations when in the last year or so costs have risen at such an alarming rate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not go again over the arguments in this Committee some weeks ago about the dissatisfactions felt by many of us about cost control by the Department and the organisation of playing fields. Clause 4(2), as I read it, is an assumption of responsibility by the Scottish Education Department for the standard and quality of playing fields. What else can be meant by the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An education authority should not acquire any land for use as the site of an educational establishment, or of playing fields to be used in connection with such an establishment, or of an extension to any such establishment or playing fields (whether contiguous to the establishment or playing fields or detached therefrom) … without the approval of the Secretary of State given in writing before such acquisition or commencement, as the case may be …"?</p></blockquote>
This brings me to the matter of the division of responsibility as between local authorities and the central Government. If this Clause goes through, never again can any indication be given that the central Government are not responsible for individual cases such as those which have been mentioned at some length during earlier proceedings of the Committee. A close analysis should be made before Report stage as to what happens at St. Colomba's, Bathgate, and elsewhere, since the present kind of situation cannot be allowed to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to the Clause, but wish to put one point to the Minister, a point which I also raised on the planning Bill. In the building of houses and schools not enough attention is paid to the finishing off. This applies very much to my own city of Edinburgh, and particularly to Gracemount where they have a good building in which the children are happy, but where the surrounding area is so bad that the children get wet and are almost drowned. What will the Scottish Office do in future to ensure that surrounding areas are properly finished off?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two arguments to be put forward on this Clause. The first relates to the problem mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) about the older schools. One hears a good deal of discussion about equality of educational opportunity, but inequality of opportunity often arises because of the state of the school buildings to which children have to go. It would be impracticable, desirable as it would be in theory, for the regulations to be drawn up under the new subsection (1) to be applicable equally to all buildings. Clearly, the Secretary of State could not lay down regulations which could be as applicable to new buildings as to old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does it not follow that several standards of requirement may have to be introduced, a certain standard for new buildings and a standard for old ones? If standards are introduced and are to be totally enforceable, as they will be when the Clause goes through, I am concerned that there may not then be the room for manoeuvre which would be required so that those older buildings could be brought up to the higher standards which we all wish to see. I do not want old, ugly, uncomfortable, unsuitable buildings to be retained by accident because the lower standards are enforceable. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can reassure us about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second argument is the more important of the two, and has already been broached. The Secretary of State by this provision is taking to himself very large powers. He is taking total powers not only in regard to playing fields but also in regard to buildings, equipment, furnishings—in other words, the lot. There was a certain discretion for local
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
education authorities under the previous Act, and I hope the hon. Gentleman will explain why that is to be removed. Under the present law the Secretary of State may make regulations prescribing certain standards for premises, equipment, and so on. Under the present legislation he may, after consultation with the local authorities, satisfy himself that the regulations are impracticable or would be unreasonable to apply for one reason or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is room under present legislation for discussion to take place between the Secretary of State and the local education authorities. If as a result of those consultations the Secretary of State is satisfied that his proposals are impracticable he may then make an order prescribing modified standards. This is an important provision which allows for an education authority to come to the Secretary of State and say, "Wait a minute. Reasonable as these regulations may appear, they will be most difficult for us to apply in our local circumstances because of difficulties which we will now enumerate to you." If the Secretary of State is a reasonable man and listens to this argument, he is empowered under present legislation to make an order modifying the regulations. This is an important right for the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Section is now extended to cover playing fields. That makes the mistake in this Clause all the more serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the hon. Gentleman will either explain that there is perhaps some mysterious Schedule which I have not yet stumbled on, which puts all this right, or alternatively why it is that a certain discretion which remains with local education authorities today is to be removed completely by this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister answers the short debate we have had on this Clause can he also cover another point connected with that raised by the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) and which arises about the prescribing of these standards by the Secretary of State? The Minister may remember that the hon. Member for West Lothian referred to a case, and particularly to the fact that it did not appear that any inspection had been made of the playing fields for, I think he said,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
at least two years, two years after they were supposed to have been completed. Will the Minister say what chance there is of an adequate and quick and up to date inspection being made of premises or playing fields which have been completed, or are supposed to have been completed, as part of a school building programme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since our last debate I have made inquiries and I find the picture is, at best, patchy. I have found some cases where inspection has been regularly and efficiently carried out and the completed project has been inspected within a reasonable time of completion and certain comments have been made and the necessary work has been done. However, I have also found one or two other cases where inspection was carried out a considerable time after completion of the work, and it makes me wonder whether there may not be some substance in the criticism made in the earlier debate that the inspection system is not adequate for the task we are putting on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are giving the Secretary of State powers to lay down standards and to make requirements it follows that we must provide the means to see that that is done efficiently. It may be thought that, in some sense, it is our fault for having put in the requirements and not provided the means to see that they are carried out. If the local authorities are to have confidence that they are getting support, then not only must the standards be prescribed, but also, the Secretary of State must be prepared to follow the matter through and see that helpful comments and suggestions are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the responsibility for ascertaining that a building or a playing field is in good condition before the guarantee of the builder expires implicitly on the local authority which gave the contract? It is not the Secretary of State who gives the contract. I apologise for the length of this intervention, but in Glasgow, at least, it is the master of works department, the architect's department, which carry out an inspection prior to the handing over by the builders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point but he cannot have it both ways. Either this is the total responsi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
bility of the local authority dealing with its own contractors or the Secretary of State is stepping in and saying, "No, these playing fields should be done in this way and not in that way. Public money is being spent on this and therefore I, the Secretary of State, must have a say in the efficiency and cost consciousness with which it is done". All I am asking is that it should be made clear to us who is responsible when something goes wrong. Does the Secretary of State take any responsibility, and, if so, can we question him about it, or is it entirely a local authority matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely astounded at the great passion on the other side of the Committee for the Secretary of State to take on all kinds of responsibilities for progressing school building projects, supervising them as they are being carried out, and inspecting the finished project. This is coming from hon. Gentlemen who are constantly bemoaning increases in Government expenditure and in the numbers of civil servants. If we were to take on the responsibility for doing this job, which is at present explicitly laid on education authorities, we should need a vast increase in the number of inspectors and civil servants in St. Andrew's House. It seems to me to be a completely absurd proposition. The division of responsibility is perfectly clear, and I am not aware that any education authority feels that it does not get adequate support from the Department or that large elements of the work should be taken over from it and put on the shoulders of central Government. I am absolutely against doing that, whether we are talking about playing fields or anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman spell out the division of responsibility? That is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps if I am allowed to continue I might do that so far as playing fields and school buildings generally are concerned. With regard to playing fields I am willing to look at the Regulations again, if there is a feeling that we ought to do more, but at the moment a minimum requirement is laid down, and the responsibility for meeting this, or going beyond it, is that of the education authority. Before making these continual speeches in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
Committee I do not know why hon. Gentlemen do not take the trouble to ask their own local education authorities about these matters. It seems to me to be an absolute absurdity to have this kind of speech made in this Committee by hon. Gentlemen who are otherwise continually moaning about increases in Government expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to buildings, there are standards and requirements laid down in the Regulations and they are a good deal less specific than they were prior to 1967. If I may say so, the fact that the Government were introducing Regulations which were a lot less specific was debated in the Scottish Grand Committee during an Estimates debate in either 1966 or 1967, and the proposition that we should cut down our responsibilities was accepted at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to hon. Gentlemen, if they want to pursue this point, that they should go back to the local authority Associations and the local education authorities and see what they feel about this. I am sure they will feel exactly the same as the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the main substance of the Clause is concerned, we are providing that it will be possible for different regulations to be made, prescribing different standards in respect of different classes of educational establishments, and in that context we have in mind different classes acocrding to the age of the eduational establishments concerned. The trouble with the existing Regulations is that they lay down requirements which apply to the new building which is being tendered for or completed at the present time and to every other educational establishment to which they refer, however old or inadequate that establishment may be. Therefore, in practice what happens is that the Regulations are inapplicable to the older establishments because in many cases it would be impossible for education authorities to meet the requirements to bring these establishments up to date. Under the Bill we are giving the Secretary of State the opportunity to do precisely what the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) had in mind, to lay down requirements which will be realistic from the point of view of existing older buildings. The trouble with laying down unrealistic requirements is that it dis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
courages local authorities because they look at the Regulations and say, "We cannot possibly bring our schools up to date ", and, therefore, there is a tendency to do nothing. If we lay down more realistic Regulations we shall encourage authorities to do what every Member of the Committee wants them to do, namely to bring existing schools nearer to modern standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to disguise the fact that it is not going to be easy to draw up regulations prescribing different standards, but we think it will be possible to do it, and we are doing it precisely to meet the kinds of points that have been made by hon. Gentlemen this morning. Therefore I hope the Regulations which come out of the new Bill will be more generally acceptable to hon. Gentlemen of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the other points which were raised, I need not mention that of the surrounding areas of schools because, again, this is something which is within the limits laid down, which take account of the need to have decent surrounding areas, and it is the responsibility of the education authority. If there are schools in the hon. Gentleman's constituency where the surrounding areas are badly laid out, or are not laid out at all, he should bring the matter to the attention of the authority concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I have brought the matter to the attention of Edinburgh Corporation, but I am also bringing it to the attention of the Minister. I am not asking for more money to be spent, but to have one school the fewer built and for the remainder to be better ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I would encourage local authorities to go that far, but we do take account of the fact that, as- well as the building, one has to provide either the playing field area or the immediate area around the school—the old school "playground" as we used to call it, and still do in some cases. My personal experience of having seen a considerable number of new and not so new schools in recent years is that education authorities do a creditable job, both in the buildings themselves and the surroundings in which they place them. It would be unfortunate—and I am sure the hon. Gentleman does not intend this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
—if it were to go out from this Committee that there is a general feeling of dissatisfaction about the way in which education authorities discharge their duties in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether it was possible to have modifications to the regulations which we are going to make under this Clause. Under the old system the modification provisions really did not work effectively because the Regulations were not applicable to old buildings in the first instance. Therefore in effect what happens is that the Regulations have little effect on older buildings, and, as a result, specific orders by the Secretary of State for modifications in practice are not used to any considerable extent, simply because there is general understanding that with old buildings it is not possible to meet the Regulations. I think this particular regulation may be much more realistic when we are trying to produce regulations which are in fact realistic, and for that reason it is retained in the legislation—not, this time, in a Schedule, I am sorry to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the necessary complexity of the Bill, and the way we have had to do this, but in Clause 22 the Secretary of State has power to relax certain regulations. So the point is covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Under-Secretary say something about what is causing me anxiety, the cutting of standards caused by rising costs of building within the 1967 Regulations, and will he say whether he intends to make new regulations giving a greater amount of money to be spent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak off the cuff but I recollect a considerable increase in the cost limits in 1967. I think it was in August. The basis of the cost limit was then changed as well, but we look at the cost limit standard from time to time. I am not able to give an assurance at the moment as to when this will be done again, but it is not my impression, from seeing recently completed schools, that local authorities have had to do anything that could be described as shoddy or false economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary answer the points I made rather than points I did not make? What I want to
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
know is when he lays down general standards, does he take any responsibility for seeing that these are adhered to? If they are not, is he likely to find out? If so, how? And what does he do about it if he does?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Regulations, plans are discussed between the Department and the education authorities and we can then see if the authority is meeting the statutory requirements. When the project is approved it goes out to tender and the tender is accepted. It is not my responsibility to supervise the building of the project and to see that it meets requirements which, I presume, are part of the contract. That is the kind of thing that hon. Gentlemen were asking me to do, but there is no doubt of the division of responsibility here between central Government and the education authorities, and so far as the authorities have any complain I think it would be that we interfere too much and that they would like us to interfere even less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArhur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Early this morning I felt we were making substantial progress. We defeated the Government on Clause 3——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not the hon. Gentleman who defeated us on Clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —then the Under-Secretary gave way gracefully on Clause 4, but now he has caused me great disappointment. The first part of his speech on this was a travesty of what was said by my hon. Friends. I understood that the Government have now so little to talk about that they have to invent these distortions which are utter nonsense, about our Income Tax proposals, and this stricture would also apply to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel), who said at the weekend that we would increase taxation by our proposals to retain the power for a local authority to charge fees in certain schools. The effect would be the reverse, and the hon. Member and the Under-Secretary are together in Looking Glass country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My proposal was an attempt to retain the power in the hands of education authorities and not to remove it. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman, in his reply, said that the power whereby the Secretary of State could modify proposals
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
after consultation with local authorities was protected by Clause 22.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grateful as I am to him for calling attention to the way Clause 22 can affect the requirements of Clause 4, the position when the Bill is enacted will again be different. Clause 22, while it applies to Clause 4, primarily applies to Section 19 of the 1962 Act as amended by Clause 4 and the unfortunate local authorities, looking at the Statutes Revised, will have no reference in their amended version of the 1962 Act to the fact that Clause 22 of this Bill retains the protection which another part of this Bill has removed. This is Cloud Cuckoo Land in legislative terms, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will, in a reasonable way, try to preserve the sanity of the unfortunate officials who work so hard in local authorities, and will introduce in Clause 4 a reference to Clause 22 containing this continued protection. Otherwise a great many people will be working in total ignorance that, tucked in the back of this Bill, is this protection which looks as if it is being removed entirely by Clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister really ought not to have told us in such a tone to go and talk to local education authorities and councillors, because those of us who live in Scotland talk with them regularly at week-ends. I will tell my hon. Friend why we are so concerned on powers. I refer him to what he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Of course, we have expert advice available, and we need not look outside the Department for it because a number of our inspectors are on further education, including informal further education, all the time. A strong team of them are involved. I do not think I can, on this Amendment, describe the various procedures for processing propositions put up by education authorities or anyone else, but advice is available through the Department, and I have not received any complaint that it has not been made available on application by any authority."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 4th February, 1969; c. 79.]</p></blockquote>
This seems to me to indicate a clear admission of involvement, which is my understanding of precisely what happens. The Department, whether it likes it or not, is involved, and it therefore becomes our business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary rebukes us for being so silly as to think that we should take responsibility to suppose that here
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
is Parliament processing a finished product. I make no apology for saying that this is precisely what we are to do. Subsection (2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) An education authority shall not—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(
	<i>a</i>) acquire any land for use as the site of an educational establishment, or of playing fields to be used in connection with such an establishment, or of an extension to any such establishment or playing fields (whether contiguous to the establishment or playing fields or detached therefrom), or"</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"without the approval of the Secretary of State given in writing before such acquisition or commencement, as the case may be, and—"</p></blockquote>
To make the point crystal clear I now refer to paragraph (ii) which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may give his approval unconditionally, or subject to such conditions as he may think fit."</p></blockquote>
If we pass this kind of thing into legislation there is a certain obligation on us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Department know that the conditions are adhered to unless it involves itself after the initial condition for commencement? I go back to the question of thinking through legislation. I am not a lawyer and I do not pretend to be, but any fairly average man reading this legislation will see that there is a clear obligation to look into the conditions. If one imposes conditions it is futile, unless one means to see that they are carried out. The Minister should reflect on the machinery for carrying out intentions. It is not that we are being difficult but merely that we want to see a proper job done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered this on so many occasions—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]—that it is hardly necessary to say much more about it. We talk about the ultimate content of regulations under this Clause and whether they should be very specific or should simply lay down general requirements and standards. I have already mentioned the 1967 Regulations. There was such interest in this matter then that although these Regulations were debatable and were subect to representations they were not debated. No one put down a Prayer or raised any points with me in 1967. They went through without debate. If there is this passionate interest in the regulations I suggest that the Committee wait till the regulations come out, and we can then debate them at great length. I am amazed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
that this should be discussed at such length now when the previous Regulations excited so little interest that there was no attempt to debate them. The actual content of the Regulations will have to wait till the Bill is passed. It is irrelevant in the strict sense to the Clause, since presumably we are all agreed that the Secretary of State should be able to make regulations and to discuss what might or might not be included in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still think the Minister is giving a very unsatisfactory answer and I hope he will answer the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) on the complicated arrangements which flow from passing this Clause. The least he could do would be to say that he will rewrite the Clause and bring it back on Report. There might then be some hope of clarification for the many officials who have to work to these regulations in the local authorities up and down Scotland. The Under-Secretary's attitude to the opposition to this Bill is in the poorest form, because many of us have been members of local authorities for long periods. I have no idea whether he has, but I think it is rare for most Members of this Committee to go home at weekends and not to talk with members of some local authorities about matters arising from current legislation in the House of Commons. It is quite wrong to imply that we are out of touch with what is going on in local authority matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not appropriate for the Under-Secretary to rebuke us for what we did or did not do in 1967.
