	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 386 proposed</i> (	<i>this day</i>): In page 185, line 15, at end insert "except areas in district (	<i>h</i>)".—[	<i>Mr. Speed.</i>]</p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was speaking this morning I expressed my general agreement with many of the views put forward by the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed), but I was not in agreement with what he said about the application of these views to the Amendments that we are discussing. I explained that I was satisfied with the case for the inclusion of Chelmsley Wood in the City of Birmingham, but my satisfaction with that case is objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that not all the arguments are on one side. I explained that my views are the result of weighing the arguments for and against. On balance, I believe that the parishes which are involved in the Chelmsley Wood development should be included in the City of Birmingham. I explained that I should be interested to know the views of people living in this area, as opposed to those of local councillors. The hon. Member for Meriden promised to obtain details of a poll that had been taken in the Chelmsley Wood area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member has kindly given me the figures. Although this is evidence of public opinion it is by no means conclusive. The figures to which he referred this morning were based on a poll which took place in the Chelmsley Wood area. It was, like an election, conducted at a local school. There was a very small turn-
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
out—only 10 or 15 per cent.—much lower than one would expect in a local election. This indicates some lack of interest by the residents of this area. It is true that the overwhelming majority of those who went to the local school and expressed an opinion on the issue voted against their inclusion in Birmingham, but, as all the members of the Committee well understand, that is much what one would expect. In this sort of test of public opinion the people who are opposed to what is suggested are the ones who go to the polling station to express their point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of test of public opinion that I should have liked to see, not in Chelmsley Wood but in other parts of the country would be more comparable with a survey conducted by market research companies, where the test consists of a scientifically-established sample of the people living in Chelmsley Wood, rather than an invitation to go to the local school to express an opinion. A sample of 10 per cent. or 15 per cent.—or 20 per cent. or 25 per cent.—based on this sort of test, is not good enough. I should like the Government to have done much more to establish the feelings of what the hon. Member for Meriden this morning called the "ordinary people".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also asked whether the Minister had visited Chelmsley Wood. I hope that he will find an opportunity to answer that question later. It is important, when considering these Amendments, to have some idea of the area itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I visited the area extensively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Member that I did, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have those reassurances, but I am disappointed that the Minister came to an opposite conclusion from myself. They do not even have the excuse of ignorance. However, I am grateful to them for making the effort to visit the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since other members of the Committee may not be as familiar with the area as hon. Members who have already spoken, we have one or two copies of the relevant Ordnance Survey map. I want to explain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
why I think that these areas should be included in the City of Birmingham, unless there is better evidence that the majority of people living in these areas do not wish to be included in the city. The parishes covered by these Amendments are Castle Bromwich, Kingshurst, Fordbridge, Chelmsley Wood, Coleshill, Bickenhill, Little Packington and Great Packington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned this morning the road from Coventry to Birmingham—the A45—which runs through the area which we are discussing and provides a link. There is poor communication between these areas and Solihull. People from Bickenhill have much easier access to the City of Birmingham than to Solihull, along the A45. The case is even clearer if we consider Castle Bromwich. There is an "A" road running straight from Castle Bromwich into Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Castle Bromwich is to the north-east of Birmingham, and some distance from Solihull. It is much more convenient for people to go into Birmingham than into Solihull.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These boundaries will not not take effect for another two or three years. What is not shown on the map is the M42 motorway, which will link the area with Solihull. Any part of the area that we are talking about will link with the motorway, and Solihull will be a matter of 10 minutes away. That is not possible on the A45. On occasions it takes an hour; I know, because I have had to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the criticism expressed by the hon. Member for Meriden about conditions on the A45. I used to work in a factory on the A45, and I know how long it took me to get to work in the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member is quite right in saying that the M42 is not on the map. I am not clear about the route of the M42 as it will go from Nottingham to Solihull, and we are waiting for further details of the route beyond Solihull. I was not aware that the route would run through Castle Bromwich. Is the hon. Member for Meriden saying that it will?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be possible to get on to the M42. There will be an interchange with the M6 at Coleshill, in that area. The M6 is not shown on that map
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
either, which makes it rather difficult. All these motorways have just been opened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me reassure the hon. Member for Meriden that both the M6 and the link to the Ml are on the map that I am looking at. I have all the details except the route of the M42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be wrong, but my view is that communcations from Castle Bromwich, Coleshill, Kingshurst, Fordbridge and Chelmsley Wood are better to Birmingham than to Solihull. The M42 may improve those communications. I hope so. At the moment Bickenhill is bisected by the A45, but there is no direct road from Bickenhill to Solihull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A glance at the Ordnance Survey map shows these are built-up areas connected to the City of Birmingham, even though the map is somewhat out of date. There have been more developments since it was prepared. On balance, I support the Amendments which would include these parishes in the City of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not entirely agree with the views expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) and my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) this morning. They began by saying that they were speaking for the City of Birmingham. I see some irony in that situation, because the City of Birmingham now has a Conservative council. The Conservative Party has a majority of the councillors of the City of Birmingham. It is unfortunate that no Conservative Member of Parliament from the City of Birmingham is on this Committee, in order to express the point of view of Birmingham. If we had one we would see whether the view put forward by my right hon. Friends, the Members for Small Heath and Northfield, was an all-party one. It is a pity, because there is some feeling amongst members of my party outside the City of Birmingham that Conservative Members of Parliament in the City have been sitting on the fence, and have left it to my hon. Friends to put forward a city point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, I agree with the Amendments for the reasons I have put forward, but I do not accept everything that has been said on behalf of the City of Birmingham. In particular, my right hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath commented on the shortage of land, and the unwillingness of counties surrounding Birmingham to help with Birmingham's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
housing problem. My right hon. Friend knows how strongly I feel about housing conditions in Birmingham. I could not have worked in Small Heath for several years without being aware of those conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel very strongly indeed about those conditions. It is not true to say that the housing problem is limited to the City of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have criticised housing conditions in my own constituency in the past. I will not repeat those criticisms, but it bears repeating that there are bad housing conditions in Worcestershire and Warwickshire as well as in the City of Birmingham. My hon. Friends were a little hard when they blamed county councils for refusing to give up land to the City of Birmingham to help solve the housing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is not that the counties will not help but that the City of Birmingham always wants land made available adjacent to its boundary. It is always proposing peripheral development. That sort of development has taken place in Chelmsley Wood and we have had it threatened for areas in North Worcestershire, in my constituency. The City of Birmingham seems to have an obsession about expanding the conurbation. This is what the counties object to—rightly, in my opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that my hon. Friends this morning had made it clear that they, too, want the counties to co-operate with the city in tackling the housing problem, but do not accept the proposals put forward by the City of Birmingham for peripheral development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am expressing a personal point of view, but I am not speaking for myself alone. This morning the hon. Member for Meriden indicated that there was a certain degree of agreement between us, but our views are certainly not identical. I was disappointed with his remarks this morning; I do not think that he referred to the housing problem at any stage until he was pressed into it by my right hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath. As my right hon. Friend knows, I recognise very strongly about this problem. We must bear it in mind in discussing these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden referred to it as "Birmingham's housing problem", and I deliberately used that phrase
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
several times in my remarks. I do not accept that it is Birmingham's problem. It is a regional problem—a West Midlands problem—and it is reasonable to regard it as one that should be solved by the City of Birmingham alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although statistics show that, on average, housing conditions of the City of Birmingham are worse than in the surrounding areas, there is a housing problem in the region as a whole. I do not want to be too hard on the hon. Member for Meriden, but recognition of the fact that it is not Birmingham's problem may be one reason why we sit on opposite sides in this Committee. Certainly the Labour Party in Worcestershire recognises that we have an obligation here, and we have spent a great deal of time discussing the problem and considering the solution. We are opposed to peripheral development, because we wish to maintain the Green Belt: we think that there are very good arguments for it. The hon. Member for Meriden and I agree on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Party in Worcestershire is very anxious to promote new towns; I have one at Redditch, in my constituency. Redditch was mentioned this morning. We have an acknowledged expert in the leader of the Labour group on the Redditch council—Councillor Walter Strand—and we have made many public statements about the need to build new towns to help with this regional housing problem. We did not accept that Redditch was a very good location for a new town. We opposed it originally, and we were overridden by the Conservative Government, but now that it is there we have accepted it and are anxious to make as big a contribution as possible to the solution of the housing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point of difference between myself and my hon. Friend lies in the presentation of the case this morning on behalf of the city of Birmingham. They tended to suggest that the City of Birmingham was anxious to solve its housing problem by moving people out of the City of Birmingham, if only the counties would make the land available. But we now have the situation that at Redditch new town we have accelerated the growth of the new town specifically to help with the housing problem of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
region, and the City of Birmingham is nominating enough tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore find it a little difficult to go along with my hon. Friends when, on the one hand, they are complaining about the shortage of land and, on the other hand, the City of Birmingham is not taking up the houses which have been made available. I recognise that the City of Birmingham has a problem, in that people do not want to move outside the City of Birmingham to areas with higher rents. This is certainly a problem in any new town. It is also true that we need jobs in new towns. But the fact is that the Development Corporation in Redditch is able to attract industry to Redditch, in spite of the growing economic difficulties in the country and in spite of the increase in unemployment. Indeed, in spite of the increase in unemployment in Redditch itself, industry is being attracted to Redditch. But the City of Birmingham does not seem to be able to find tenants to take up the houses. I know that there are many people in the City of Birmingham who could move outside the city, who do not depend on jobs being made available for them. There are a lot of retired people and handicapped people living in the City of Birmingham who are badly in need of being re-housed. I should have thought the City of Birmingham could have done more to transfer these people to the new town at Redditch or at Telford. or the overspill development of Droitwich or to the Chelmslev Wood area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Small Heath and for Northfield referred to the burden which is borne by the City of Birmingham in order to benefit Solihull and Sutton Coldfield. The hon. Member for Birmingham. Small Heath referred specifically to roads. Again I must make the point to him that this is a regional responsibility, and although the City of Birmingham may have made a major contribution to the improvement of roads in the city, and leading from the city to Sojihull and Sutton Coldfield. nevertheless this is again a regional problem. Certainly I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree that the voice of the City of Birmingham, which tends to dominate the passenger transport authority in the West Midlands, has not always exercised its influence towards the improvement of public transport in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The town of Redditch was mentioned
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
this morning, and perhaps I should explain how it was that this was referred to in connection with these Amendments. The City of Birmingham, in suggesting that these areas should be transferred to the City of Birmingham, made another suggestion, which was that Solihull should be compensated—that is their word, not mire—by the inclusion of Redditch, which is part of Worcestershire. The Minister read a letter from the Clerk of Redditch Urban District Council this morning, so I will not go into detail on this subject except to say that I regard the suggestion of the City of Birmingham that Redditch should be merged with Solihull as totally ridiculous. I am pleased that the Government treated that suggestion with the contempt which it deserved. But the hon. Member for Meridan was being too complimentary to me this morning when he suggested that the reason that the Labour Members of this Committee had not put forward an Amendment on that subject was the result of my powers of persuasion. In fact, I am quite sure that the hon. Members for Small Heath and for Northfield did not pursue any such Amendment because they have enough commonsense to know that it is ridiculous. I am very pleased to have their support in refusing to put forward any such Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In opposing the Amendments this morning the hon. Member for Meriden suggested that one could not have one Amendment, that is, including Chelmsley Wood in Birmingham, without, on the other hand, the other Amendment including Redditch in Solihull. I do not accept his argument. I see nothing inconsistent in supporting the Amendments for including Chelmsley Wood in Birmingham, at the same time reiecting the suggestion that Redditch should be transferred to Solihull. Solihull is big enough already. I see no reason why it should include Redditch. There is no road, in fact, from Redditch to Solihull. Solihull is large enough to be a metropolitan district on its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an Amendment to include Tanworth-in-Arden in Solihull, and that Amendment I wish to support. It is logical for it to be included. I have seen no suggestion that the people of Tanworth-in-Arden are opposed to the Amendment. The Minister may wish to correct me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that representations make it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
quite clear that they are opposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know what those representations consisted of because, as I have said several times before, I am not wholly satisfied with the suggestion that councillors should express a point of view and that we should not take into account the opinion of the people who live in Tanworth-in-Arden. I should certainly be interested in knowing their views because Tanworth-in-Arden is much closer to Solihull than it is to Stratford-on-Avon, although at the moment it is in the Stratford-on-Avon Rural District. On the Ordnance Survey map which is available to us, Stratford-on-Avon is only just on the map because it is so far away from the areas we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to develop that argument further in relation to the City of Birmingham. I believe that the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) had a point this morning when he said that the City of Birmingham is big enough already with Sutton Coldfield, without the inclusion of Chelmsley Wood. In my view, the City of Birmingham may be too big in any case, without the inclusion of Sutton Coldfield. I think it was unfortunate that the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) did not put forward a case on behalf of Sutton Coldfield this morning because I should have been very interested to hear it. He contented himself with moving the Amendment formally. The people of Sutton Coldfield, in my opinion, have not had their view expressed adequately in the Committee. I hope, therefore, that he will make a contribution explaining why he thinks that the Amendment should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have just indicated, I incline to the view that the Amendment which has been put on the Order Paper by the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd) does not go far enough. There has been some comment during our proceedings about the two hon. Members who represent the City of Birmingham on the Committee I have referred to them myself—the hon. Member for Small Heath and the hon. Member for Northfield. In fact, there are three Members of the Committee who represent the City of Birmingham. As a matter of fact, I have many constituents who live in the City of Birmingham. They not only work there; they actually live there. They pay
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
their rates to the City of Birmingham. I have several parts of the City of Birmingham in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of interest, I have some 250 constituents living in the City of Birmingham as well, so there are four Members here who represent Birmingham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have 7,000. You might have the impression, Sir Stephen, that everyone living in the City of Birmingham is very happy to be living there. That is not the case. Only this week I received a letter from some of my constituents who live in the City of Birmingham, in an area known as Holly Wood, an area which was transferred from the County of Worcester to the City of Birmingham some years ago. These people are very dissatisfied with their inclusion in the City of Birmingham. Their residents' association wrote to me this week and asked me to do everything I could to arrange for their transfer out of the City of Birmingham and said that they would much rather live in the County of Worcester. Unfortunately, I only had this letter this week and so I do not have the detailed statistics, but they told me that they had conducted a poll amongst their members. I am told that the members of their association include 65 per cent. of the people living in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If I mistake not, the interesting part of the country in the hon. Gentleman's constituency is not featured among the Amendments, so perhaps we could leave it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue the point, but I am trying to explain why the City of Birmingham may be too big already, and why I agree with some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Meriden. It is interesting that these figures showed that 47 per cent. of people living in that part of Hall Green wished to be transferred to Bromsgrove rural district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fergus Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I am getting more and more confused. The theme of the hon. Gentleman's argument seems to be not to make Birmingham any bigger; yet, according to the Amendment Paper, I see that he has signed his name to Amendments that would make Birmingham bigger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, and I shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
explain why. If the hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) will stay with us, he will hear the extent of my argument; 47 per cent. of this area of Hall Green wish to be transferred to Bromsgrove rural district; 31 per cent. wish to be transferred to Solihull. They would have been transferred to Solihull under the Government's original White Paper on which they have now reneged. Only 11 per cent. wish to remain in the City of Birmingham. These figures indicate that there are people in the City of Birmingham who wish to belong to other local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is a case to be put forward for Sutton Coldfield, but I shall not put it forward because I think that the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), who formally moved the Amendment, should put forward his arguments. I think the case could be made out for the Amendment which he has moved formally not going far enough. A case could be made out for Sutton Coldfield to stand alone from the City of Birmingham, and for a larger part of the City of Birmingham to be transferred to the new Sutton Coldfield metropolitan district. I say that there could be a case, and I should be interested to hear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thinking, as I do, that the City of Birmingham may be too large already, I believe that Chelmsley Wood should be transferred to the City of Birmingham. In other words, I am suggesting that the division of Birmingham should be on an axis running from east to west, rather than north to south. There is a case for saying that Chelmsley Wood should be included in the City of Birmingham but that other areas should be excluded from the City of Birmingham. Therefore, I see nothing inconsistent in supporting the Amendments in the names of my hon. Friends and myself on the one hand, and, on the other hand, saying that were different Amendments tabled, I might support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I should like to make one other point. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) made a very significant remark this morning when he said that the City of Birmingham feels slighted by the Government's proposals. The city council of Birmingham has reached the stage where it appears to be obsessed by expansion, and this is why it wants peri-
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
pheral development. It wishes to continue to have more Chelmsley Woods. It wishes to continue to expand the boundaries of the City of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reverting to its suggestion that Redditch should be included in Solihull, as hon. Gentlemen will realise if they look at the small map which is available, this would leave a finger of Worcestershire projecting between Solihull and Birmingham; that finger would still be in my constituency. I am referring to the parish of Wythall, which has been threatened by the City of Birmingham on a number of occasions. I am quite convinced that if the City of Birmingham had its way and Solihull did include Redditch, at a later stage it would approach the Boundary Commission and ask for Wythall to be included in the City of Birmingham. As I have said already, those people who have been taken out of Wythall already and put into Hall Green feel very strongly about it and wish that it had not happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned my reasons for supporting several Amendments. I support the Amendment to include Chelmsley Wood in the City of Birmingham. I support the Amendment to include Tanworth-in-Arden in Solihull. I support both these Amendments because I believe them to be right. It does not weaken my criticism of the City of Birmingham for their expansionist attitudes and policies. Contrary to what the hon. Gentleman for Meriden said this morning, I believe that Chelmsley Wood has already been lost to Warwickshire in everything except local government boundaries. We should recognise that fact, but we should prevent the City of Birmingham from encroaching still further on the Green Belt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to speak on this group of Amendments. I rise only to ask the Minister to clarify one point which he made in the course of his remarks, concerning Birmingham airport. On Second Reading the hon. Member for Luton (Mr. Simeons) raised the whole question of airports and asked who would own them when the airport was situated in another authority's territory. Although the Minister of State for the Welsh Office mentioned this point in his summing up, with respect, he did not clarify it at the time. I wrote later to the Secretary of State, since Bristol is involved in this sort of situation, pointing out that uncertainty
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
in this matter was delaying things. The Minister said that this would be decided on the basis of representations and that it would be speeded up as much as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today the Minister has said that Birmingham airport would belong to Birmingham, and I should like to know whether this is a special case. Does he say this because the airport is immediately adjacent to the boundary of Birmingham? Have representations been made? What is the position? Has there been any change of which other authorities should be aware?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister wishes to reply to that point but, if not, I should like to reply to the Minister's intervention and to wind up this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be convenient to deal with that point The airport land is owned by the City authority at the moment, and the assumption here is that the property would be transferred by order, as provided in later stages in the Bill, to the new district authority of Birmingham. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to discuss another piece of property, perhaps he might put down an Amendment at some appropriate time and it could be considered as a probing Amendment on that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister intervened at that point. It will enable me to reach a tidy conclusion, and it might help you, Sir Stephen, to know that it is our intention to withdraw the Amendments, as far as they concern us, since we think the principles are so important that we need to return to them on Report if we are fortunate enough to be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister said amounts to government by mathematical formula. The whole of the Ministry's argument is an argument about numbers; it is an argument about the size of Solihull and the size of Sutton Coldfield. Nowhere has the Minister anything to say about the contents of the argument which we put to him this morning about the employment situation, the future local government situation, the industrial strength of Birmingham, and those matters. If the Minister will not mind my saying so, I think he was at his best when he told us that there are 83,000 people living in Sutton Coldfield and if they were not put into Birmingham,
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
where were they to go? It was clear that we would not put them into Sutton Park, but we might put them anywhere else that was convenient. However, it was not convenient, So the case for Sutton Coldfield rested entirely upon the mathematical figures with which the Government are left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same way, in respect of Solihull I was disappointed that the Minister did not deal with that, but since we are coming back on Report, by then he will have had plenty of time for another think about it, which is what we hope will happen. Why is it not possible to have a growth area? If Tanworth-in-Arden was added, for example, to Solihull, and it was recognised, as it must be, in 40 or 50 years' time as the natural growth area in the Midlands, it would make sense to start with a population below 200,000, because one would know that it would be building up to that in the relatively near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of the Government's case is based entirely on a mathematical formula. As someone who has been associated with local government for 25 to 30 years, I do not believe that the lives of millions of citizens can be governed on the basis of mathematical formulae, although the size of an authority is relevant to the quality of the service that it can provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we are now in an extraordinary position in regard to the Minister's explanation as to why the Government have changed their minds between the publication of the White Paper in February 1971 and the publication of the Bill in November 1971. The Minister says, in his very attractive language, "I went there, I listened, I walked about, I flew about, and I took note of everything that I was told. Therefore, we dropped these proposals."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will translate that into simple "Brummie" language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Spare us!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members opposite, Sir Stephen, are merely underlining the point that I am about to make, which is that this Government and this Minister, with his hon. Friends, have listened to everybody and acceded to the request of everybody except the citizens of Birmingham, who are the last people to have their representations taken into account. The people of Bickenhill, Meriden, Chelmsley
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
Wood and Kingshurst who were to have been put into Birmingham are now being left out beeause they do not want to be in Birmingham. The one set of people whose wishes are not listened to are the million and a quarter people who happen to be the citizens of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You may think. Sir Stephen, hon. Members opposite may think, and the Minister certainly thinks, that it is pitching it a little high to say</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to tell hon. Gentlemen that the leaders of the Birmingham Conservative Party, all the leaders of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and both the Conservative newspapers in Birmingham, day in and day out, are saying that this Government think that Birmingham does not matter and that is the reason for the grave economic situation that exists in Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must in fairness say that they started to say it about the last Labour Government. But it has become a crescendo. It would be truer to say not so much that they say the Government thinks that Birmingham does not matter, but that Whitehall thinks that Birmingham does not matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may well be true, as my hon. Friend says. There is a real sense of grievance existing throughout the city, and when the Minister says today, as his main argument against the Amendments. "I have listened to Kingshurst, Cnelmsley Wood. Water Orton and all these other places, but I did not listen to the City of Birmingham", those fears and feelings in Birmingham, even if they are irrational and unjust, are underlined by the attitude that has been expressed in the Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The biggest disappointment that I have had with the Minister is on the question of the economic importance and the industrial strength of Birmingham. I was disappointed because I hoped that I had made it the main plank of the case that I was trying to make. I will briefly recall the point. If there is a large industrial city of tremendous industrial importance, not only to itself and its conurbation but to the economic strength of the nation as a whole, it is very foolish to undermine
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
the strength of that city unless one is certain that the changes that are being made will guarantee its continued prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not even attempt to talk about this; he did not start to meet the point. He gave us no explanation as to where the Government see Birmingham in the central economic situation in the country. He has not said one word in reply. I must say the same about the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) who took exactly the same line as the Government and completely ignored the economic and industrial arguments with which we ought to be concerning ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Meriden that although the citizens whom the hon. Member represents would like to be outside Birmingham and have expressed this view to him, it is even more important for the constituents of Bromsgrove and Meriden to know that the industrial strength of Birmingham is going to be maintained so that they have a job next week or next year, than any other consideration with which this Committee w ill deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Birmingham's case is right it will be of no service to the constituents of Meriden and Bromsgrove to say that they can stay outside Birmingham, but the industrial strength of the city is being so weakened that their personal economic future is in jeopardy. That is the answer to a lot of these people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove gave us some illuminating public opinion poll results from part of Birmingham, but he was not able to tell us why these people wished to leave Birmingham, and he never hazards a guess as to why they want to leave. You, Sir Stephen, and I, know why they want to leave Birmingham. They want the best of all worlds; they want the jobs that Birmingham can provide, but they want to move to another authority where the rates are lower. They want the benefits of Birmingham on the cheap, and that applies to many of the constituents of the hon. Member opposite as well as of my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should just tell my right hon. Friend that I have had a number of complaints from that part of my constituency about the City of Birmingham, and it is not that the people who live there object to paying Birmingham rates: they feel that they get a worse service in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
City of Birmingham than they enjoyed previously. I do not know whether they are right or wrong, but that is their sincere belief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend tells me that, I am delighted to accept his explanation. I must say that it is a shattering reflection on Conservative councillors who represent them if this be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of my constituents who moved to Kingshurst in 1964, 1965, make exactly the same point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It cannot be so. The hon. Member knows the honest answer there, and he ought to tell his constituents. I should be happy to come to Kingshurst and tell them. In fact, I am the lirst life member of the Kingshurst Labour Club, so the next time I go there I shall tell them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member knows perfectly well that unless Birmingham had cared for them, unless Birmingham had fought to get the land to put up the houses those people would not be in Kingshurst. They would not have this option open to them now. It is rather like saying, "I am all right, Jack. I have my house in Kingshurst now and to hell with the rest of the homeless and the slum dwellers in Birmingham". Frankly, knowing the people of Kingshurst as I do, I do not believe it. I do not believe that this degree of selfishness exists among people living outside Birmingham who have everything to thank Birmingham for—not just for their jobs but for their homes and the opportunity of a decent life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, one day, the hon. Member for Meriden would like a nice, academic debate—perhaps it will not be quite so academic in his constituency—I should be delighted to come along and argue the case in Kingshurst. If he thinks that he might not be welcome in the Kingshurst Labour Club, I can assure him that he will; as the first life member I should be delighted to take him along as my guest, and I can think of no better place to conduct this discussion as a contribution to public thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the Conservative Club?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservatives do not have one yet, but I understand that hope springs eternal in the breast of Conservatives in Chelmsley Wood; they are just about to put up a Conservative Club there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we should speculate as to where this parish is to he rather than on its future buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to conclude my quotation by saving that the vicar who told me this last week hastened to add that there would be no Conservatives in the club when it was built, so I should be able to come if I wished. He was probably right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to my main economic argument. Something almost sensational has happened between our meeting litis morning and our present meeting, which emphasises my point about the industrial importance of Birmingham. The Birmingham unemployment figures have been published today. They show that 1.263 more people are unemployed in Birmingham today than at this time last month. According to today's figures, Birmingham now has 37,601 unemployed. If that does not underline the critical economic and industrial crisis facing the City of Birmingham I do not know what docs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that I did not have these figures this morning, but I am glad that they have now come to hand. I am sorry that the Minister is saying nothing about the future industrial importance of Birmingham; he is not commenting on the relevance of those figures to the general case that he is presently trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of the combination of forces necessary to provide the land, the jobs and the houses for the people in the Midlands conurbation. Since the Minister admits that he has drawn the boundary line very tightly around Birmingham he is really telling Birmingham people that the Government cannot guarantee them a home in the future. At the same time, the Government are sticking to their i.d.c. policy in respect of Birmingham, and refusing to change their industrial policy in respect of the West Midlands—for reasons that we understand, even if we think that have now been overtaken by events. Combining those two things, the Government are now telling the people of Birmingham. "We cannot guarantee you a home if you stay in Birmingham, and if you move out of Birmingham, as we think you should, we cannot guarantee you a job when you get there."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, that was what my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove was saying when he was referring to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
importance of new towns. I agree with him. I made several visits to Redditch to study the problems there, when I had some responsibility in the matter. The right way to deal with this problem is by new towns. That policy has not always received the enthusiastic response that it should have had from the benches opposite, but it is to the credit of the Government that they are carrying on with the new town policy and are hoping to make a great success of it. It is crystal clear to anyone who studies the situation that the provision of a house and of a job must go hand in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it that my hon. Friend can tell us today that there are lettings of houses available in Redditch for Birmingham people but Birmingham cannot nominate people to go there? The answer is simple. When people come to my advice bureau every month, complaining of appalling housing conditions, I tell them that I can get them a house in Redditch immediately if they will go there. They say they cannot do that, because the combination of high rents in Redditch and the high cost of travel from Redditch to their jobs imposes too great a burden. I am sure that my hon. Friend will accept that; it is a fact of life in this situation. That is why we say that there must be an overall Government policy, and it is no good to talk about boundaries or local government in isolation from the industrial and economic facts in the conurbation as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the National Exhibition Centre and the airport. The hon. Member for Meriden will not be surprised to know that the Conservative leaders, who were listening to his speech this morning with great interest, had some very hard things to say about his comments upon the possibility of other people helping Birmingham construct the National Exhibition Centre. During lunch I spent some time talking to officials from Birmingham and leaders of the city council. I can tell the Minister that his reply and that of the hon. Member for Meriden have raised again the future of the National Exhibition Centre and whether Birmingham can afford to proceed with the project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Meriden that the facts are simple. There is a limit to what Birmingham can fork out without any proper contributions from elsewhere. Out of a total of £15 million for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
National Exhibition Centre the Government are making £1½ million available. The other £13½ million is to be found by the citizens of Birmingham. That is why feeling in the City of Birmingham is so strong; it is expected to finance the whole thing, but the advantages, such as the rateable value, will accrue to Solihull or some other authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member saying that Birmingham is not interested in anybody else in the region making a contribution towards this £13½ million? Scondly, would he like to estimate the cost of the infrastructure which has determined the site, and will improve the site—which is not a Brimingham responsibility but a Government responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the second point, I will try to supply the figures on Report, but I do not have the infrastructure costs at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in a position to answer the first question categorically. The City of Birmingham did not want to take on all this responsibility on its own. It asked Solihull, the Meriden Rural District Council, and every Midland local authority, whether they would put up some money to make the project a regional one. Solihull turned it down. The only authority—to its everlasting credit—that offered Birmingham a penny of help was Burton-on-Trent, which offered a grant of £1,000. We were grateful to Burton-on-Trent for its offer, despite the fact it was only for £1,000. But it is Solihull that will receive the rateable value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore tell the Minister that when, this morning, he said that he hoped that under the terms of the Bill there could be a joint working party, and that joint financial arrangements could be made, we in Birmingham hope so too. If the National Exhibition Centre is considered to be of great importance we hope that other local authorities will row in with us for its provision. But our experience has been such that we have the gravest doubts whether they have any interest in making a contribution, rather than getting something out of this tremendous project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances I hope that the Government will think again between now and Report, and ask themselves whether it is fair and right that, if this country is to have a National Exhibition Centre which is to be placed in the heart of England, it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
should be financed entirely byBirmingham, but that the site should be placed elsewhere, so that Birmingham loses the benefits, including the rateable value benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister spoke about hotel accommodation he knew that the proposal was that the hotel and the conference room should be built on this site. They will not be built within the City of Birmingham. Birmingham, with a degree of magnanimity—and not much magnanimity has been shown to it in this Committee by other than Birmingham Members, so far today—has specifically tried to locate this exhibition centre on the main railway line—one hour from Euston—and on the motorways—one-and-a-half hours from London. We all know that there will be a considerable amount of commuting to the National Exhibition Centre. In the long run, the story of the National Exhibition Centre will be that Birmingham will finance the bill and everybody else will be happy about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say that this financial burden comes at a moment when Birmingham is feeling the crippling blow of the withdrawal of Government support for the city, mainly due to rate support grant procedures and falling population. The facts are there for all to sec: in the last five years Birmingham has lost £4 million of Government help. That is a great financial burden for Birmingham to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister relied in his arguments on land for housing on the West Midland planning conference. The West Midland planning report proposes two small areas of land for the housing of the Birmingham homeless—that is all; two small areas, totally insufficient to provide a solution to the problems that face it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) is quite wrong in his approach, as I tried to tell him by way of an intervention, to overspill in his constituency. It is not an adequate reply to say that owner occupiers are being provided for, and that that, therefore, is a help for Birmingham. Of course it is and we are grateful for it. But that is typical of the attitude, which I am criticising, of Conservative county councils throughout the country, who provide for overspill of owner occupiers provided the council tenants are kept out. That is really what the hon. Member for Meriden said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
intervened I gave him as a specific example the Borough of Tamworth. That borough has been both ratepayer and Labour-controlled. Staffordshire County Council is Conservative controlled. Relations between all the bodies are excellent and this great overspill scheme is going ahead at a great rate, mostly in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be able to assure the hon. Gentleman—he keeps bobbing up just as I am coming to the point he seeks to make, but I do not complain about that, because we always do it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman takes too long to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what that impertinent intervention was by the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) who, having moved an Amendment for me, did not have the decency to say even one word in support of it during the whole of our debate. It is not the first time that the hon. Member for Cannock has taken that attitude in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was specifically referring—on this point since I did not mention Staffordshire or Tamworth in my speech this morning—to Chelmsley Wood and Kingshurst, which is what I am talking about. I am very happy to move on to Tamworth, and indeed I am glad that the hon. Gentleman reminded me about it. He is right, and I would not want it to appear that I did not appreciate his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Staffordshire County Council is the one county council which is an exception to the general rule about providing land for Birmingham. It was done, if I may say so to the hon. Gentleman, under the leadership of Sir Alfred Owen, when he was chairman of the Staffordshire County Council. He took a far-sighted and generous view about the great problems affecting Birmingham, particularly in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had other opportunities to pay my tribute, but I do so again. It is true that now, since the days when Sir Alfred departed from the leadership of the Staffordshire County Council, help in Staffordshire is mainly concentrated in Tamworth. We are grateful for that too, but it is right, as the hon. Gentleman says, that Tamworth is a Labour-controlled council and also has a very good and generous attitude towards Birmingham's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
problems. I certainly join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to that situation today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

With regard to ownership and nominations the Minister came nearer to being helpful to us, and I express my appreciation. Obviously, he will want to think about how this aspect can be written into the law. It is a very difficult situation. He will understand that Birmingham will not be happy if it loses the ownership of these houses. He will understand that point. But if the Government say that that is not to be, at least it will be something if we retain the rights of nomination. But I must tell him that at the present time the agreements which Birmingham has on overspill with all its neighbours is that Birmingham has only the right of the first nomination, and makes a financial contribution for 15 years to obtain that right. If somebody leaves, or dies after a year or so, the right of nomination under existing agreements reverts to the local authority within whose area the houses have been built. I only mention this to show the complexity of the matter, and I know the civic leaders of Birmingham will be grateful. There are very involved questions in the rate of nomination for relettings. I would at least</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin by explaining my present attitude towards the Amendment as it stands, the way in which I hope to deal with it, and the extent to which I hope subsequently to come back to parts of it, which may be possible some time next week. With reference to the latter point. I indicated earlier today that I might have liked to take the Amendment standing in my name and that of my hon. Friends Amendment No. 337, and the subsequent Amendments, with Amendments Nos. 239, 240 and the subsequent Amendments, but after discussion with the Minister I understand that he is not yet ready to deal with the latter Amendments, and since we are seeking to keep the door open on this important question involving the whole of Teesside it is proper to have the co-operation of the Minister. Nevertheless my Amendment deals with the matters raised in Amendment No. 239 and the subsequent Amendments. Nos. 240 and 342 to 348. and I cannot pursue my Amendment without making some reference to them. I think that I should give my reasons, very briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first object in drafting the Amendment was to seek metropolitan status for the area referred to in the proposals as Teesside. I naturally had to exclude all those areas in Schedule 1. under the general heading
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the administrative county of Yorkshire. North Riding—"</p></blockquote>
with the exception of Guisborough. Loftus, Saltburn and Marske-by-the-Sea. Skelton and Broton. The purpose of my Amendment was to exclude Whitby, and all the other subsequent rural districts and parishes, because it seemed quite illogical to argue the case with this vast rural area which has particular characteristics in many respects quite different from the community interests of the general industrialised and urban area of Teesside and Hartlepool to the north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In submitting my Amendment in draft
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
form, I pursued the extent to which my interpretation could be upheld, and gathered from the Public Bill Office that I need not include these areas. The Committee will notice that in my Amendment I sought to add the new county borough with the exclusion of those rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirmed with the Public Bill Office that I would nevertheless have this drafting interpreted in such a way that the exclusion of the areas that I have referred to were a pertinent part of my Amendment. However, because I am aware that together with the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox), the hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks. (Mr. Kitson), the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Michael Shaw) and the right hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) I have signed the Amendments which will be coming up next week, and in deference to the Minister's wishes—because he is not ready to deal with them—I shall not go into too much detail. However, for the purposes of arguing a case for metropolitan status for Teesside it is important at least to make some reference. I hope that that explanation will help to keep me in order as I proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the purposes of the record, there must be some brief reference to one or two matters so that there can be some clarity of understanding. The first is in reference to the name. The Bill proposes that it shall be "Teesside". In my Amendment I use the name "Teesport". I have already made it public that in conforming with the principles laid down in the White Paper the use of the word "Teesport" is purely temporary. It is only for the purpose of avoiding aspersions being cast that I have a prejudicial attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The committee can imagine the extent to which the hon. Member for The Hart-lepools is highly conscious of the sensitivities of the area, and must seek to respect them. The extent to which I am prepared to go in submitting the Amendment to the Minister is indicative of the continuance of this attitude, because I believe that at the end of the day the form, shape, size and extent of local government physically, and in terms of its functions, depend entirely on the extent to which people like myself—and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and, indeed, public representatives in the area—are willing to discuss objectively all the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
interests in order that these sensitivities can be upheld and that harmony itself can be used as an instrument for producing a local government unit of reasonable size and in the end, I hope, of metropolitan status. That is the second area of explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, I think that the Committee should know that my approach to the problem of Teesside has gathered more support from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee than has any other Amendment before us. Having made that statement, I must qualify it in order that, in the course of my references to the Amendment, I do not embarrass any particular hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my Amendment, my right hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, East (Mr. Bottomley), my hon. Friends the Members for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) and for Goole (Dr. Marshall) and I seek to pursue the principle laid down without, however, being committed to any argument about the precise nature of the boundary or without entering into any discussion in Committee on what would be thought to be the type of metropolitan districts for whatever reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to myself and my hon. Friends, the hon. Members for Stockton-on-Tees (Mr. William Rodgers), for Darlington (Mr. Ted Fletcher) and Cleveland (Mr. Tinn) have today informed me that they support the general principle, but again with the understanding that discussion of the whole problem should be sought in order to come back to the point that I made at the beginning—that we should seek, in presenting our case to the Minister, to keep the door open. We do not want to take up a rigid posture at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox), the right hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Sir Robin Tur-ton), the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Shaw), the hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks. (Mr. Kitson) and I agree—and here we are more precise—about what we think should happen to all those rural areas which are south of the present Tees county borough, including Yarm, the rural areas of Stokesley and all the parishes within it. All in all, we have some 11 hon. Mem-
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>
bers totally representing the Tees to the north, the Tees conurbation and the North Yorkshire area affected by the Bill. Both Labour and Conservative harmonised on the principle, and, in one respect to which I have latterly referred, in precise detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in the debate when we were referring to the Tyneside metropolitan area, or at about that time, the Minister conceded that the weight of opinion brought to his attention in the form of support by hon. Members impressed him sufficiently to respond favourably. Since I now seek to present myself more pertinently to the Amendment, I hope that this preamble to my submission will impress him just as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must accept that it is impossible, on any criteria laid down in national legislation, or by any test of opinion from the centre, to. produce consistent yardsticks and judgments which can be applied in every instance in a highly complex, industrialised and densely-populated country such as ours. There are bound to be exceptions to the general rule. There are bound to be exceptions to the general approach to the problem of local government. Since the processes of Parliament have sought, throughout the centuries, to work on the principle of seeking compromises in difficult situations, I am satisfied about the validity of any exceptions to any general criteria to which the Minister may have addressed himself. He is not unaware that the local authorities in the area, without committing themselves totally to acceptance of the proposals, but in the event of their not being altered in the Bill, have discussed whether the name of the area shall be Cleveland. This name, which has a compendium of support in the area, and which certainly deals with the sensitivities of local authorities, in that it is removed from the word "Teesside" and does not produce too much conflict, has been submitted to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If our submission is accepted or is the cause of the Minister initiating fresh proposals or modifications, the term Cleveland, acceptable though it is, becomes available for re-examination, because traditionally the whole of the Cleveland area is more the concern of the hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks., the right hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton, and the hon. Member for Scarborough and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
Whitby and other hon. Members in the North Yorkshire area. Cleveland does not make much sense to Hartlepool, north of the Tees, nor would it make much sense to the urbanised area of Teesside north of the Cleveland Hills. Again, it is an example of the extent to which, if we are patient, we can use agreement on a name to arrive at other agreements, if we are prepared to listen to other points of view. We must understand that the efficiency of local government is more likely to be ensured through this process than by taking up rigid postures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to indicate where there is common ground—that is, in the northern part of Yorkshire, which it is proposed to put in the new Teesside non-metropolitan county—and to re-emphasise the essential need to accept that this is one of the important arguments that I must deploy to substantiate my submissions for metropolitan status for the rest of the area, it might be interesting to look at some observations of the people concerned. I had today a letter from the Town Clerk of Teesside, and was rather surprised to discover that he was anxious that the proposals submitted by the hon. Members for Shipley, Thirsk and Malton, and Scarborough and Whitby were not to the liking of the present Teesside county borough, and I was invited to oppose the hon. Members in their wish to bring the rural areas back into North Yorkshire. The Town Clerk of Teesside county borough said in his letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee expressed its disapproval of these amendments, more particularly having regard to the fact that Whitby Urban District Council itself expressed its preference for retention within the County area".</p></blockquote>
I repeat that I am not prepared to enter into any disagreement with hon. Members opposite, who have worked with me informally and freely, and without pressure, to the ends they seek. When, however, I receive a letter from the Teesside county borough, inviting me as a member of a Standing Committee to oppose the hon. Members, I then examine the reason why. Once we understand why an authority is pursuing a particular course of action, and we find it wanting, then we must take great care about subsequent problems raised by the same county, and the extent to which we can be persuaded to give credence to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must inform the Committee that in reference to that statement about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
preference of Whitby urban district council, the hard fact is—and the town clerk knows it and has deliberately sought to mislead me—that that preference was exercised by the casting vote of the chairman of that council. Worse than that; it so happens that Whitby rural district council carried out a referendum. It is not for me to argue how the referendum was organised, or to examine in detail the areas in which it was carried out, but, with great respect to the town clerk of the rural district council of Whitby, he was much fairer to me than the town clerk of Teesside when he explained that there would be difficulty because of the kind of weather we were having at the time. He anticipated that it would not be 100 per cent. It is interesting—and I am sure that the Minister will take this into account that that referendum showed that some 75 per cent. of the people want to remain in Yorkshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marcus Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitler). I am not sure that these figures are right in the cases that he has mentioned. My information is that 70.95 per cent. of the inhabitants of the rural district and urban district voted and, of those who were approached, taking the urban district and the rural district together, 96.47 per cent. were in favour of slaying in Yorkshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) because this information is more precise. I telephoned the North only today and I was told that the figure was approximately 75 per cent. This information that I have given the Committee, while not radically different from the more precise calculations or information supplied by the hon. Member, nevertheless indicates the generality of the will of the people. The hon. Member for Shipley will agree that this is far more weighty information than that submitted by the Teesside Borough County Council town clerk on the basis of a casting vote of a chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole area in Yorkshire that is put into the Bill puzzles me extremely. For instance, the Minister knows that when he was in the North, he discussed matters with several of the affected authorities together on two separate days, and he listened with great care to their sub-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
missions. This I do not question. However, the Minister will recall that I referred to this earlier in the debate on the first Part of Schedule 1, and I did not feel that consultations carried out in this way met the problem adequately. On the other hand, the Minister who is responsible for piloting the Bill through the House has the strictures of limited time on his hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, Easington Rural District Council—that is, that area which was not included in the metropolitan county of Tyneside, now accepted as the new Tyne-Wear Metropolitan Borough—made a plea not to be included in the Teesside Non-County Borough. Generally, these areas were Easington, Horden, Blackhall and Peterlee. Their submission, either because they made it or because of other considerations, was accepted. It so happens that I was born in Easington. It also happens that I have spent all my public life in Hartlepool. Not only do I know the nature and the character of my constituency extremely well, but I know exceptionally well the place of my birth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Easington, Horden and Blackhall are, in two respects, far more qualified to be in the non-metropolitan county of Teesside or, as I hope one day, the metropolitan county of Teesside, than in the Rural District of Whitby, or in the parishes that surround the pivoting community of Stokesley. These coal areas and their populations are nearer to Hartlepool, which is considered to be an important urban part of the new proposed Teesside. Also they are industrialised areas, and the areas in North Yorkshire are not. Therefore, while I hastily seek to avoid any misinterpretation, and while I am making no strong plea for Easington, Horden and Blackhall to come into Teesside, and indeed, because we were successful in persuading the Minister on Tuesday night to include Murton and Cold Hesleton into the Easington Corridor, my own knowledge of the area is such that I can readily tell the Minister that I am not anxious to press that part of my Amendment which includes Easington. We have changed the situation, and a changed situation means that any hon. Member should take it into account and seek to show magnanimity towards that alteration, because the hopes and aspirations of those people in Easington, Horden and Blackhall, and now Murton and Cold Hesleton, with their long affili-
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
ated associations with Durham, are, in my view, worthy of upholding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when we consider Whitby Council, we find that there are other contradictions. In addition to the illogicality of keeping Easington out, and keeping Whitby in, we have other illogicalities, not now between the north and the south of the Tees, but between Whitby and Stokesley and the other areas. As I understand it, we have Whitby Rural Council making a submission to be excluded, and its application was not heard as favourably as that made by Easington. Yet, on the other hand we had a different approach so far as Stokesley was concerned. It sems to me, looking at the submissions made by most of those concerned in North Yorkshire, that the best way to treat the illogicality of including them into Teesside is to accept the only thing which is logical, that the fundamental, traditional and close ties of those parishes, villages and townships and seaside resorts with North Yorkshire is such that it would be, in my view, a tragedy in terms of local government to ignore it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We find here that the economic structure in part of the proposed Teesside borough is in conflict with the economic structure of other parts. Let me give an example. I should imagine that the livelihoods of the people in Whitby Rural District Council and the other parishes to the west and slightly to the north is such that the people earn their living by farming and other rural occupations rather than by any other kind of occupational pursuit more consistent with the urbanised life of Middlesbrough, Stockton, Darlington and Hartlepool. I would also go so far as to say that the seaside resorts of Whitby and the coastal villages to the north are completely different from the seaside resorts of even Hartlepool, where the people enjoy their sea frontage, having left the steelworks, the shipyards, the nuclear power station and all the industrial infrastructure of the area. Therefore, these elements of the work, the character of the people and the geographical setting must be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is something outstanding in North Yorkshire which we shall seek positively to develop next week, and that is the question of the North York Moors National Park. To me it is quite illogical to interfere with this excellent setting by intrusions of local government boundaries
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
which are foreign to the whole area. Anyone who has lived there or visited there can, without studying the people, see the fundamental differences between these two areas of North Yorkshire and the urbanised area of Teesside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all know that Teesside is an area of considerable prosperity, and we all hope it will develop even more. In spite of that, is the hon. Member saying that the employment situation in those areas in North Yorkshire—Whitby, Robin Hood Bay and areas like that—will not be in the least affected by the employment situation on Teesside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will go further. I think that it will not be affected, and from my considerable experience of industrial development, both as a Member of Parliament and as the charman of an industrial department in Hartlepool, I say that the positive, pertinent, focused interests of councillors in urbanised areas are such that if this new boundary goes through there will be no inducement to encourage light industries to go to these areas. I am satisfied that they might go in the opposite direction—that is, the 'pools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone should know by the behaviour of people in public life that I represent the electors of Hartlepool. The hon. Member represents Shipley. The members of Teesside county borough at the moment are responsible to that new borough, and the councillors in Hartlepool are responsible there. Consequently, when they talk in terms of employment, unless there are men of exceptional vision, men with unusual capacities, it will be found that development departments industrially promoting the interests of Hartlepool and Teesside, with the active organisation of Troy, will promote the interests of Teesside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will claim that they are concerned with the region as a whole but. in practice, the compelling interests of the area often times are far more predominant than the interests of the whole region. If people are prepared to argue against this proposition, let them look at the dilemma of any Government over the past 40 years or so nationally—how to counteract the compelling interests and focal points of industrial and commercial activity in this country. We have development areas, because no Government have yet found out how best to beat the
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
interests and the magnetic pull of centres of commerce and industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) is conscious of this, as also are the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Michael Shaw), the hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks. (Mr. Kit-son) and certainly the Father of the House, the right hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member but I am sure he will appreciate that he is devoting a great deal of his speech to those areas which he is not proposing to include in Teesport rather than to the areas which he is proposing to include.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Sir Stephen. I was looking at the Minister, and I thought that, as we have a kind of telepathy working here, he was saying to himself: "If this is a case of being free of the subject this week, what am I going to get next week?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude my answer to the hon. Member for Shipley. I confirm his feelings that the new county, if it ever comes about, will not work industrially and in the best interests of the areas with which he is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving Whitby rural, I will briefly state that I have had submissions from Great Ayton and other parishes, and they are quite emphatic about their future needs and how these can be satisfied in terms of local government. They do not want anything to do with Teesside. That is quite clear. Therefore, we will leave that subject until next week, when we shall deal with the details more pertinently when we come to the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly we have had submissions from Stockton Rural District Council, on their fears about how they will be affected if the present proposals remain and the "Big Brother" of the area, the Teesside county borough, gets its own way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry. or the Home Office—I forget which—announced the allocation of seats for this new non-county borough of Teesside only a few days ago. I was very worried, indeed, because apparently 90 seats are proposed for the new non-county borough of Teesside, of which'15 will be allocated to Hartlepool and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
preponderance of the remainder are to be in the Teesside county borough area of the moment—about 63 seats</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Here I am quite sure we are out of order in discussing the allocation of seats. We must return to the Amendmenls we are supposed to be discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I must try and press this one. Sir Stephen, because the present proposals in the Bill are are for a non-metropolitan county of Teesside and I am seeking to amend it. One of my objections rests on the worries which have arisen from the announcement of the representation in the proposals in the Bill. It seems to me that this has created a good deal of worry. I have had representations made to me already and they have crystallised the need to take great care about what is happening in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I come to one or two matters affecting my proposals for a county borough, perhaps I may give this undertaking to the Minister. I shall not be seeking to divide on this Amendment. I shall not be seeking to take up a rigid position. I have already indicated to the Minister that there is common cause among all the Members of Parliament in the northern part of Yorkshire whom I have mentioned. I have already conceded since Tuesday night that an Amendment to the Tyneside metropolitan county has changed my approach to the Easington "corridor"—as the Minister described it on Tuesday night-and I have also publicly indicated that there is a need not to be too rigid about the future of Darlington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister accepts the modifications which we are suggesting to him, namely that Easington be allowed to remain, as he proposed after his talks, and the North Yorkshire areas be allowed remain in North Yorkshire. I can ask, him to look at the more urbanised and remaining part of Teesside again and. through discussions, produce proposals himself on Report, and let us have a more permanent solution to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use the word "permanent" with care. I have great hopes for this area. It is around the mouth of a great river which has already been nominated as one of the 15 major ports in the United Kingdom.
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
A great deal of capital investment is earmarked for it. It is the only area in the world where there is a nuclear power station bang in the middle of the population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Laurance Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Chicago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It certainly has not got a nuclear power station of the size of ours. In any case, Chicago is not very much in my thoughts. I am concerned, not with promoting the interests of Chicago—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman spoke of "the world".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking of the area in which there is a 1.250 mW nuclear power station bang in the middle of some 500,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are confident that this area has all the hallmarks for treatment as a metropolitan county borough. I have said that we want to keep the door open. In addressing myself to the general problem, that is the posture which I have sought to adopt. I also believe that, because of this need, the Minister can be satisfied that, if he pursues this example, the opportunity to make a proper evaluation of development over the next few years might help him to draw up, in consultation with the authorities concerned, an area more acceptable than that proposed at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present proposals, local government does not have much meaning. Here we have functions for district councils which, at the very outset, are in conflict. There are a number of examples in the Bill of district councils of similar sizes, with efficient and viable services, which are being treated differently purely on the basis of becoming either metropolitan district councils or non-metropolitan district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that where there are authorities—and my authority is one in point—with approximately 100.000 people, with services organised, supported and developed from the base of an all-purpose local government authority, where there is a long history, indeed 800 years of self-government and 70 years or more of being an all-purpose authority, recently, amalgamated with the township of Hartlepool and West Hartlepool in 1967, such an authority is bound to feel, as Darlington is bound to feel, as I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
certain that any other township of this size is bound to feel, resentment and disappointment at being offered fewer functions, purely because of the accident of being nominated a non-metropolitan district, while in the same country with the same kind of rateable base, with the same kind of population base, there are some metropolitan districts within proposed metropolitan counties given functions far in excess of those to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore there is bound to be a feeling of loss which any local authority must seek to put right, and I should like to point out to the Minister that there is a reason why we should think carefully about this—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman again, but he will realise that this is a long Bill. In the course of it we shall discuss the functions of the different authorities to be set up under the Bill. We ought not to spend so much time on it at this stage. We should be discussing the boundaries and who should be in which authority. We shall discuss the functions at a later stage—if we ever get there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree but I recall that earlier in the debate the Minister himself gave an undertaking that he would examine Schedule 1 in detail. One of the great demerits of the Bill is that it has not been dealt with in detail at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must correct the hon. Member. It is proper for us to consider the Schedules in detail within the rules of order. I do not think it within the rules of order, in discussing boundaries laid down in the Schedules and things of that description, to go into a general, philosophical discussion on the functions of the different kinds of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully agree, but I am sure that your anxiety about the matter will be reasonably corrected if, with respect, I am allowed to point out to you, Sir Stephen, that I was saying in effect that there are certain criteria about the development of the metropolitan and non-metropolitan concept which must bo looked at with care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a mistake to think in terms of a metropolitan or a non-metropolitan concept purely on the basis of population. Other criteria are involved. One is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
ability of an area or a district to carry out its social services and local authority functions efficiently and cheaply. That would be a criterion in addition to population. That is my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Replies on this issue are often concerned with population. I listen patiently, because I know that a Minister's job is to convince the Standing Committee. But in return I seek to convince the Minister that there are other criteria. They include community, shopping, transport and leisure interests. They are vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes that the new non-county borough of Teesside shall have a population of some 696,000 spread over an exceptionally wide area, but largely concentrated into a much smaller urbanised area. Is this population base fixed? With my suggestion, North of the Tees there would a population base of 300,000 people, and south of the Tees a population base of about 280,000 a total for a metropolitan county of 580,000. This would mean that populations on the periphery of the area, mainly those in North Yorkshire and Easington, could be absorbed far more efficiently by the areas to which they traditionally belong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is reason to believe that if the Minister were willing to consider this proposal, local authorities would be less rigid in their approach. If he accepts the population criteria I have mentioned as well as the other criteria, he will find no difficulty about dealing with the matter on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Efficiency and viability have to be balanced against people's interests and size has to be balanced against democracy. If we allow this proposal for Teesside to go unamended, a Northern area will lose its traditional pride in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Viability is a dangerous concept. Anyone with experience knows that the larger a local government area, the less the interest in elections. County boroughs of 150.000 have been able to produce exceptionally efficient services at unit costs highly favourable compared with larger county areas. When all hon. Members from an area work together in the common interest, the Minister is in a position to say that he has reason to reconsider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the exciting development potential of the urbanised areas and the need to preserve the great qualities in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
rural areas I have named, my Amendment should produce the response I have requested. For that reason, I do not intend to press it to a Division, and I hope that the Minister will accept that that is not a light gesture on my part. On the other hand, I face the realities: there is no point in Standing Committee in seeking to batten down on the Government or in attempting to defeat it against its will. What is more important is gaining the interest of the Minister in such a way that he is prepared to reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the delights of these debates is that when an hon. Member speaks, he knows the area about which he is speaking. I thought at one stage that the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) was going to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I remember, I remember,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The place where I was born.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It wasn't in Chicago,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It was Easington at dawn."</p></blockquote>
He might have added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My heart is now in Hartlepool,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Because that's where I've gawn."</p></blockquote>
At least the hon. Member knows what he is talking about, if at times one thoroughly disagrees with what he is saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said at the outset that in seeking metropolitan status for Teesside he had excluded certain areas around, and in particular those areas which used to be in the North Riding of Yorkshire: the areas of Whitby urban and Whitby rural. He then referred to Easington in the north. He could not possible have argued that Teesside with those rural areas could have metropolitan status. Even excluding them, it does not necessarily make that area a candidate for metropolitan county: status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The non-metropolitan county of Teesside, as we have drawn it in the Bill, is already in danger of becoming a gigantic extension of Teesside county borough. It already would command 66 per cent. of the population of the non-metropolitan county we have suggested. Excluding the Whitbys would place Teesside in a position of commanding 69 per cent. of the population. If we exclude some of the other areas which he mentioned, such as Great Ayton, it would put Teesside up to 70 per cent. of the whole county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teesside itself is growing. In 1951, the population was 335,000; in 1961, it was 374,000, that is up 12 per cent. in 10
	<span class='label label-info column'>814</span>
years; and in 1971, it was 395,000, up another 10 per cent. in 10 years. I think that it will go on growing within its own county borough boundaries because there is sufficient space for it to grow. It is now in a commanding position in that county, thereby creating some concern to us about the imbalance which may grow in future. Certainly, it would be folly to remove from the surrounding areas from the county which tone down the dominance of the Teesside county borough within the county. I should have thought that this argument would appeal to the hon. Member for The Hartlepools, because it is for him and the town which he represents to seek to have a strong influence within this non-metropolitan county. In order to put an argument for a metropolitan county he is defeating some of the interests of his own town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He then referred to the name "Teesport". As I said when we were discussing Tyne-Wear yesterday, I am only too pleased to have proposals for new names for counties which appeal to the public in that area, but I have had no response at all to the name "Teesport". He also suggested "Cleveland" to which there was some response, but nothing to persuade one to move away from the generally accepted name, Teesside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His third point of explanation was the support he has had from hon. Members. He said he had gathered the greatest support ever. I think that he has gathered support for this matter to be discussed, but I should not say that there was great support for making Teesside a metropolitan county, which is what we are discussing now. In forming the non-metropolitan county we have taken into account the wishes of the people in the areas to be included in that county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as Whitby urban district is concerned, we first took the constitutional decision of the local authority. I am aware that that decision was only reached by a casting vote. We were faced with the problem that Whitby urban, according to that vote, wished to go into Teesside; Whitby rural, which surrounds Whitby urban, did not wish to go into Teesside, but one could not extract, or do a sort of Bangla Desh of Whitby urban to join it up with Teesside, without taking in Whitby rural. Since that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>815</span>
original vote of the local authority there have been the referenda to which the hon. Member referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless I have personally examined the way a referendum has been taken, I am not wholeheartedly in support of it. I took the figures which arrived out of this referendum and I found that in support of this petition, which was headed "Whitbys for Yorkshire", in Whitby urban district 68 per cent. signed the petition and of those 94.46 per cent. supported Whitbys for Yorkshire, that is, taking them out of Teesside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were separate figures for the rural district, but if I might give the figure for the two—Whitby urban and rural districts taken together—those in support were 70.95 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course one must take this into account, although I must say that this has not been decisive in all cases. Where one has a small village and it does not matter whether it is one side or other of the boundary of the counties for planning or services or local government point of view, one is apt to take the wish of the people in that village. But where one is dealing with large towns which have influence within an area, one has to look further. So I would say, that although we pay attention to the feelings of those in towns such as Whitby, they are not the decisive factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor, with great respect to the people of Great Ayton, would the charming Christmas card which I received from them, as I am sure other hon. Members did too, cause me to make any decision for or against them. I am not suggesting that this was any bribery, I was delighted to receive the card and I thought it was very kind of them to send us a card and to remind us that we were considering their destiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many things one must take into account other than the wishes of the people, although those wishes play a large part. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the North Yorkshire Moors National Park. It is important to take that into account, and if possible, one does not wish to run county boundaries through a national park. But we have several national parks, very well administered, which fall in more than one county, so I would not put that as an absolute factor in decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member asked that we should not judge whether an area should be a metropolitan county by population. But
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
population means many things other than the number of people. It means the resources at the command of that area. If that population is compact, if the area is populous, that means much in the administration of that area. Therefore, we have based our decisions on metropolitan counties or non-metropolitan counties on the compactness of the population of the area. Where we have a compact population, a continuous build-up over a small area, the area is a candidate for metropolitan status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But Teesside is one county borough, populous, growing. It is the town of Hartlepool and the hinterland to those two—I hope I shall be forgiven if I talk of Whitby as a hinterland, but the two major towns are Teesside and Hartlepool, and there is nothing else on which one could base a metropolitan county. According to the Amendment it is a metropolitan county of one district. If I may say so the hon. Member for The Hartlepools has funked dividing the area into districts. I do not blame him. it is extremely difficult to show how the districts would emerge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that on reflection the Minister would place too much weight on the word "funked", especially addressing himself to me. If I had addressed myself to districts I should have taken up a rigid position, and I have objected to that in the arrangement of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that a submission of general principle, leaving the Minister to discuss districts with those affected, would be far more practical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to take the Amendment as it is, although I am not quibbling about technicalities. The proposal is that this should be a metropolitan county of one district. Let me take that first, and then I will concede that one might divide it into two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A metropolitan county of one district is going straight back to the unitary authority system, which we have discarded. Indeed, we have debated it already and voted against it. So I have to seek some other solution, because I could not possibly admit a metropolitan county consisting of one district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wholly wrong, whether this is a non-metropolitan or a metropolitan county, to divide again the County Borough of Teesside. It has just been formed;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>817</span>
it has made all its investment in a county borough of that size, and it would be wholly wrong to tear it to pieces again at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have therefore, to set Teesside county borough as one district; that would be a district of 452,000. Then we are left with a semi-circular district running from Whitby, in a clockwork direction, to Darlington, Hartlepool and, if the hon. Gentleman had his way, as his Amendment is written, Easington as well. This would not in geography, in community of interest, in any way form a satisfactory district. If one did not take in Darlington, the district of Darlington would be too small and the rest of the area would be left with a population of only 185,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It therefore seems impracticable to create a metropolitan district out of this non-metropolitan county as we have set it out. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hartlepools for suggesting the Amendment and discussing it as moderately as he did, because he has raised the whole principle on which we base our decisions about whether an area should be a metropolitan or non-metropolitan county. He has also drawn attention to some of the unsatisfactory features of this non-metropolitan county of Teesside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I willingly agree, as he obviously wished, to hold this decision open for further discussion, and I should be glad to look in detail at the matters which he has raised relating to those fringe areas. I see no prospect of bringing Easington back into Teesside. I am sorry to divorce the hon. Member from his birthplace now that he has gone to Hartlepool, but we came to a firm decision about what I called the Easington corridor for Durham County. Even if we retain the non-metropolitan county of Teesside, I should not bring Easington back into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will certainly consider, and we shall have a chance to consider on a later Amendment, the southern boundaries, the Whitby urban and Whitby rural, and a number of the areas on the south side of the Tees which may rightly be included as being a continuation of the built-up area of Teesside. It is well worth having another look at those. On that basis I invite the hon. Gentleman not to
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
press this issue any further but let us come back to it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has responded more or less precisely as I expected. I am already prepared to follow his example and perhaps may say to him.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister has responded well.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The words I used</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister has gone a little way</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And might go further another day."</p></blockquote>
In that sense I wish to take advantage of his undertakings. I am sure that he does not give them lightly and that he is anxious to keep an open mind.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Awdry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two Amendments relate to Gloucestershire. I am a Wiltshire man, representing a Wiltshire constituency, but as there is no member here for Gloucester I was approached by the Gloucestershire County Council and a number of local people in the area to move these two Amendments. I live reasonably near the area, and know it well at first hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Gloucestershire County Council approve in general the new proposed area 27 but wishes to see certain minor changes along the southern boundary. The Minister has a plan on which the Government boundary is marked in red and the Gloucestershire County Council's amendment is marked in green.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government proposals were accepted they would have the effect of ex-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>819</span>
cluding from the new county of Gloucester a number of parishes whose populations have close affinity with mid-Gloucestershire, rather than with the area to the south. Eight of these parishes are in the Thornbury Rural District—Hinton. Hamfellow, Berkeley, Ham and Stone, Hill Alkington, Tortworth and Charfield. They are the subject-matter of Amendment No. 379. Four of the parishes are in the Sodbury Rural District—Alderley, Hawkesbury, Badminton and Acton Turnville—and they form the subject-matter of Amendment No. 378.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that the case for the parishes in Thornbury rural district is the stronger case of the two. From my experience of the area, I detect a stronger local feeling there than I do in the Sodbury Rural District Council. If it were a question of accepting only one of the Amendments—and naturally I hope that both will be accepted—I would choose Amendment No. 379. I want to emphasise at the start that there is no question of substantial populations being involved. The Minister said in the last debate that where one is dealing with small and not large areas the Government intended to listen closely to what the local people had to say. This is precisely that sort of case. The total number on the Thornbury rural district, and this includes children, is about 7,200 only, and the total number in the Sodbury rural district is only 2,100 souls. So this is a fairly small Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total electorate of the Thornbury R.D.C. is about 4,500. I mention this because a petition has just been started. I think the local people thought that we would not reach this Amendment for some weeks to come so they have not got on with it very well, but already nearly half the electorate have signed the petition saying that they support the Amendment. That gives some indication of the local feeling that has been aroused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware of the local feeling, because he attended a meeting at Bath University last year, when the views of these parishes were expressed to him. After that meeting, many who attended believed that these parishes would be included in Gloucestershire and were surprised to find, when the plans came out, that they were not. Hence their dismay, and hence these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put my arguments very shortly under three headings: first, community of inter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
est; secondly, educational considerations and, thirdly, economic links. I shall deal first with community of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thornbury rural district lies between the, respective spheres of interest of Gloucester and Cheltenham to the north and Bath and Bristol to 'the south. Parts of Thornbury rural district have close community of interest—and I accept this at once—with Bristol and the south, but equally there are some smaller part which look to the north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept from the Minister that it is always difficult to draw an accurate line on a map, but the Gloucestershire County Council has come to the conclusion Chat these parishes of which I am speaking really belong to the north, not to the south. For example, there is a very close affinity between Berkeley and Dursley. Many workers at the Berkeley atomic power station, which I understand employs about 1,000 people, live in Dursley and the surrounding area. Many who live in Berkeley, work in Dursley, and 	<i>vice versa,</i> and cross this line to get to their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the social and leisure sphere there is also close affinity between the Berkeley area and Dursley. This also applies to youth clubs and similar organisations, as was emphasised at a meeting which I had yesterday with the headmaster of a school near Berkeley. I also met a county councillor for Berkeley, who was born and bred and has spent his whole life there. He felt very strongly that it is an area which still belongs, and always will belong, to Gloucestershire. That is the community of interest point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I turn for a moment to educational considerations. For secondary school purposes, ail the parishes in the Thornbury area that I am talking about, except one, fall within the Berkeley catchment area. The only exception is the parish of Hill, which is very small, and apparently only six children of secondary school age come from Hill. All the parishes in Amendment No. 378 fall within the catchment area of Wotton-under-Edge to the north. Perhaps more important than the schools and the youth employment services. These services at present operate from Dursley and Sharpness, only five miles away from Berkeley. Under the Government proposals, the youth employment service would be based at Filton, some 17 miles away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The headmaster of Wanswell, near
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
Berkeley, who took the trouble to come all the way here yesterday to see me, emphasised that his teachers readily attend the teachers' centre at Dursley, on a voluntary basis, and receive great benefit from it. If the Government proposals go through, these teachers will have to go to a teachers' centre based on Filton, 17 miles away, so the school would suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn finally to the economic links. Here I should mention the Sharpness docks, which form part of the Gloucester docks system. The Gloucestershire County Council take the view that it would be appropriate for this area to come under the control of a single authority, so that uniform policies can be established, both for industrial and recreational development. This seems to be completely logical. It does not seem sensible to cut off the Sharpness docks from Gloucester. I hope the Minister will deal with this poin in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the views of the Thorn-bury R.D.C. do not coincide with mine, and members of the Committee may wish to put forward the views of the Thorn-bury rural district. One understands how Thornbury feels. The effect of my Amendments would be to cut off a small part of the rural district and give it to somebody else. I sympathise with its feelings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are not really major Amendments. This is just the sort of case where the voice of the people should be heard. It makes sense to me on the grounds of economic argument, education services and community of interest. The Amendments will strengthen Gloucester and they will not weaken Avon. They have the support of the people who live in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to make a decision tonight, but I ask him to say that I have put forward a reasoned case, that he has listened to the debate, and that he might think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From a personal point of view, both these Amendments would have been of great convenience to me some years ago, because I contested the South Gloucestershire constituency in the 1964-66 election. This was on the periphery of the area where I had to work, and I had in many cases to travel many miles in order to see people. I know something of the area. I have a great respect and admiration for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
people, and I made many good friends up there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry) has put the case very fairly, but perhaps I could deal with a few points which have been put to me because as the only Committee member for the proposed Avon county I have had some representations from the Thornbury rural district and also from the school at Wanswell, to which the hon. Member made reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fear has been expressed that should this area remain in Avon—I am referring now to the eight parishes centred around Berkeley and Sharpness—the docks will suffer because of the potential development of West Dock and, of course, the existing Avonmouth Dock. This fear is probably overrated because, despite many gloomy prognostications in the past, Sharpness Docks are now much more thriving than they were and, in fact, their trade is oriented towards the Midlands. Also, the nature of the trade and the connection with Gloucester, which the hon. Member stressed, support the Amendment from that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was also put to me strongly that there is a work orientation towards Dursley, but the people involved might actually find that there was an advantage in being in Avon, because it was said to me that the wage levels in the engineering works in Dursley were considerably lower than corresponding wage levels on the periphery of Bristol in the aero-engine and airframe works. So here, again, there is a balance, and it is a nice point which way it would go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, concern about the splitting up of the catchment area for the school. The education facilities in the Berkeley area were extremely substandard for a long time, and the coming of the new school at Wanswell was widely welcomed by the local population. The staff there have worked hard to build it up and establish traditions, and there is great concern at the splitting up of the catchment area which will result from the present proposals. It would be helpful were the Minister to say something about how he sees this sort of problem, which is bound to recur in different parts of the country, being resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great growth potential in this area of the Thornbury rural district, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
hon. Members will know, and this also applies to the Sodbury rural district. The Severnside study suggested that the area around Frampton Cotterell should expand, and increase greatly in population, and so it might well be that if these eight parishes around Berkeley and Sharpness remained in Avon they would benefit more from the initiative and growth generated by the development around Thornbury and Yate-Sodbury than if they went into Gloucestershire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I understand that they consider themselves very much as Gloucestershire people. It is an area which has long historical associations with Gloucestershire—not only is Berkeley Castle there, but Dr. Jcnner practised in Berkeley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All along the banks of the Severn, on the cast side, there are potential sites for growth; this is probably potentially the greatest growth area in the country. Hon. Members will know that there are two nuclear power stations in the area, one at Berkeley and one at Oldbury. There is one planned for Aust. This might be a factor which would tip the scale towards Avon. Nevertheless, I see from the map that this is an extreme projection of Avon county and, from an administrative point of view, it might even be tidier to chop it off and put it into Gloucestershire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Amendment deals with the parishes of Badminton, Acton Turnville. Alkington and Hawkesbury. The case here is rather dilferent, because all these parishes lie on the dip slope of the Cots-wold scarp. I know that it is in the Government's mind that, where there are scenic features of great beauty, boundaries may be redrawn in order to preserve them. Hon. Members will have noticed, in looking through the Bill, that three parishes on the northern side of the Mendips had been cut in half in order that the Mendip Plateau may be treated as a natural feature. I say to the Minister, in passing, that in doing this he has committed geographical sacrilege, because the three parishes which he has cut up are the best examples, within an area of two miles, in the whole country of the three characteristic types of village in England. That is a point which he will probably bear in mind and which we may discuss later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to think of the Cotswolds as a natural feature to be preserved under one authority—and hon. Members will
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
probably know that their characteristic features are threatened by modern farming techniques—the second Amendment makes sense. I repeat that these people regard themselves very much as Gloucestershire folk. Badminton parish centres on the home of the Beaufort family, and this is very much a part of Gloucestershire. Some hon. Members may have undertaken the pilgrimage after the war, which I used to do year after year, to see Walter Hammond play in the Duke of Beaufort's annual match at Badminton after he had unfortunately retired from first-class cricket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Amendments were carried on sentimental grounds, this one would go through unanimously. I must, however, be honest with the Committee. I have no knowledge myself of the feelings of the local people, as the hon. Member for Chippenham has. I am simply speaking from what I know of the area and how the people feel. I do not think that there is any great work-orientation or journey-orientation towards Bristol and the urban area around it. This Amendment, therefore, makes pretty good sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all these parishes were transferred into Gloucestershire, a very neat boundary would be produced running from the north-west to the south-east; it would tidy up this corner of Avon and make it a more compact unit for the potential metropolitan area which, the Minister will probably concede, may come in to future. He has said in the past that his mind is not closed to the possibility of creating further metropolitan areas in the light of developments. The northern part of Avon is certainly ripe for this and, in accepting these two Amendments, the Minister would be doing a tidying-up process for the future metropolitan area and, at the same time, satisfying the feelings and traditions of the local people who still regard themselves as very much part of Gloucestershire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry) in the remarks he has made, and the hon. Gentleman in the remark that he has made just now. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham. I know from personal experience the southern parishes which are contained within Amendment No. 379. I have ridden over most of these parishes at one time or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
another, and often fallen over them. I therefore have painful memories of some of those parishes, and perhaps for that reason my hon. Friend might accept that my views towards them are likely to be fairly objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe, as the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) implied, that there is any major principle attached to either of these Amendments. It is a matter of opinion whether the parishes mentioned should go into Gloucestershire or Avon. But I think that, since it is a matter of opinion, very considerable attention should be paid to the views of the local people, which have been described by my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly understandable, indeed it is entirely logical, that when the boundaries for the new counties were being drawn the logical boundary between Gloucestershire and Avon would seem to be the boundary of the existing rural districts in which these parishes are situated. But I think the logical boundary becomes less logical once Gloucestershire is divided, as it will be, between the new Gloucestershire and the county of Avon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community of interests has already been referred to by both hon. Gentlemen who have spoken already. The Gloucestershire County Council accepts entirely that the rural districts of Thornbury and Sodbury represent what has been referred to as the interface between the respective spheres of influence of Cirenceser, Gloucester and Cheltenham to the north, and Bristol and Bath to the south. But since these two rural districts are the balance between the spheres of influence of these towns it is not surprising that when a new boundary has to be drawn the local county council and local people should realise that the parishes in the northern parts of the rural district should be more closely attached to the north and the parishes to the south more closely attached to the south. An important point was made by the hon. Member for Bristol. South when he mentioned the edge of the Cotswold escarpment. That is a natural boundary, and my hon. Friend should pay attention to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point relates to population and rateable value. If these Amendments are changed, what will happen is that the population and rateable value of the county of Avon will be marginally re-
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
duced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of population it will be reduced by about 9,300, and as a consequence the population of Gloucestershire will be increased by a similar number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, as forecast in Circular 8/71, the population at Avon would be 933,000, whereas the population of Gloucestershire would be only 468,000. Therefore, purely on the basis of population it can be argued that there is something to be said for the Amendments, because they improve the balance to some extent. Likewise, Avon has a higher rateable value—more than twice as high as that of Gloucestershire. Therefore, the new Gloucestershire would benefit marginally by increased rateable value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made that point from my own knowledge of the area, I suspect that the services provided from the county—certainly in the area referred to by Amendment No. 378—will have to be subsidised by ratepayers throughout the rest of Gloucestershire if that area is to be in Gloucestershire, or by the ratepayers out of the rest of Avon if the area is in Avon—because I suspect that the rateable value' of that area is very low. In consequence, bearing in mind the educational facilities that are required, and the roads, and so on. I have no doubt either way that the area contained within Amendment No. 378 is subsidised from elsewhere. In spite of that, the Gloucestershire County Council, which has a far greater knowledge of the matter than I have, has asked that the boundary should be redrawn, possibly to its financial disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind what must be the local emotions and views on this matter, I hope that the Government will review the boundary between the two counties. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham. I do not expect that the Government will be able to make any concession or final decision tonight, but I hope that they will give these points detailed consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to my hon. Friends, and to the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) for the points they have made in support of the Amendments. It has been difficult to decide where these parishes had their main pull—whether it was to the south or to the north. I attended a meeting of many local authorities in Bath
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>827</span>
during the consultation stage. The proposition put forward in these Amendments was put forward there by the Gloucestershire County Council and the parishes concerned. It involves the movement of a population of 9,300—namely 7,200 in the Thornbury rural district parishes and 2,100 in the Sodbury rural district parishes. So we are dealing with a population of 9,300.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two rural districts concerned—the Thornbury and Sodbury Rural District Councils—oppose the county council in their plea to move these parishes into Gloucestershire. Gloucester, on one side of the border, wants these several parishes; the rural districts the other side of the border do not want to let them go. As against that there was the expression of opinion by those who represented the parishes themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the meeting that I attended the opinion was expressed mainly by those who represented Berkeley speaking for the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham has put this forward on a basis of three points, the first of which was community of interest. He said that parts of Thornbury—undoubtedly the southern parts of Thornbury—looked towards Bristol, but he claimed that the parishes mentioned in the Amendment looked to the north. He gave exemples of the tie between Berkeley and Dursley. I heard the same thing from the representatives of Berkeley at the meeting that I attended. At that time I was not sure whether we ought to have drawn the boundary to include Dursley, because the two seemed to be tied closely together. I thought that rather than taking Berkeley out we ought to have included Dursley. Considering the rural district as a whole, however, it seemed to me that it was dependent on Bristol to the south rather than on any of the towns to the north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is a difficult point. It is really a repeat of the first point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham—the community of interest. That is the thing on which that community of interest was mainly based. However, we cannot allow the boundaries of new authorities, which we hope to be fixing for some generations ahead, to be determined by the catchment areas
	<span class='label label-info column'>828</span>
of any individual service—however important that service may be—just because it happens that within the existing administrative framework the service has been established to serve two areas—one on side and one on the other side of a county boundary. In any event, new installations will be built as they are needed. In the meanwhile, interim arrangements can be made to carry on the services. I take that into account, but we must not use it as the only factor on which to base the drawing of the county boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's third point concerned the economies of the area—work and employment. He referred particularly to Sharpness Docks. The hon. Member for Bristol, South said that he thought the idea that Sharpness Docks would be overpowered and allowed to decay by being included in the Bristol rather than the Gloucester complex was overrated. I think that he is right. We cannot judge an area by the fact that certain docks at the end of a rather long canal ought to be with the town at the other end of that canal. It is rather like saying that the railway terminals in London should be in the districts of Brighton and Bournemouth, and all the rest of them at the other end of the line. I am sure there is a great future in the area of Sharpness Docks, but it is for that reason that I came down in favour of including the northern parishes of Thornbury Rural District within the area of influence of the growth which we see coming around Bristol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In pursuance of the Severnside study the Thornbury Rural District and the Sodbury Rural District come into that development area. There will not be development over the areas of beautiful countryside, but certainly in a large part of Thornbury I am sure that there will be development. The whole of Thornbury will benefit from that development—far more than if we try to split it up and put part of it to the north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, I have talked mainly about Thornbury. The few parishes in Sodbury are a different problem altogether. My hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham said that he thought that the Thornbury parishes in the north had a stronger case to go to Gloucestershire than the parishes of Sodbury. I should say that it is the other way round. I have far more doubt about the Sodbury parishes than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>829</span>
I have about the Thornbury ones. I am satisfied that we are right, and that we shall benefit those Thornbury parishes by keeping them within Avon—and in the plans for development of the area. With regard to the parishes of Sodbury, however, including places like Badminton, in the proximity of the Cots-wolds, I should like to have a look at them again and study not so much the social aspects as the geography, because from the point of view of amenity we may not have made the right choice here. So I would ask to be, allowed to have another look at those parishes, although I cannot hold out any hope to my hon. Friends about the parishes of Thornbury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Awdry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the Minister very much for meeting all the points that I tried to put forward and for listening so carefully to the argument. I was very disappointed in what he said about Thornbury, but at the end I was more happy about what he said about the Sodbury area. Therefore, I hope that when he takes this back for consideration so far as Sodbury is concerned, he may have another think about Thornbury, particularly in view of the helpful remarks by other Members when I moved the Amendment. In these circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We on these benches are interested in Amendment No. 172 which you have told us. Sir Stephen, may be taken as part of this group. It is important because it involves the question of the town of Luton and its designation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an earlier stage in our discussions I told the Committee that I had had the benefit of a discussion with the Mayor and the Town Clerk of Luton and other officers who came down to discuss the question with us. The purpose of the Amendment in the first instance is not necessarily to enshrine Opposition thinking in the proposals in it but. at any rate. to explore the mind of the Government and to see how they meet the objections which have undoubtedly been put to them as they have been put to use by the Luton Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we have heard the answers of the Government, we shall consider whether they are satisfactory or whether we ought to register any opinion about them. At an early stage in our deliberations, when we were discussing the relationship between district councils and the neighbouring authorities, one had some cause to talk about the effect which distance would have upon the services for the local inhabitants. In the case of Luton the point is essentially made. All the qualms, fears and arguments can be found in respect of Luton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly until now Luton has governed itself with some degree of distinction. I may say that it has very rarely been controlled by people of our political persuasion on this side of the Committee. but one has been impressed with the efficiency of the services which have been rendered for the people of that borough. I think particularly of education. I recall. as Under-Secretary of State for Education, going there to discuss with them a matter of great importance—the very considerable influx of immigrant population and its effect on the County Borough of Luton. They, I am glad to say, responded to the help and advice which the Government of the day tried to give in dealing with the situation. It meant stopping schools, for example,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>831</span>
from becoming—if I may use the term in the nicest sense—over-populated with immigrants to such an extent that a balance between the host community and the immigrant community got out of hand, a matter to which I pay the greatest possible attention. The present Government, whilst agreeing with our main objectives about an integrated community, would not pay as much attention as I paid, for example, to the question of the dispersal of population within the County Borough of Luton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that nowhere in the country has this dispersal policy worked more smoothly and more happily than in Luton. One possible reason is that they put a very eminent football referee in charge of the programme—my friend Mr. Macmullen, who happens at this moment to be chairman of the referees' committee of the Football Association, and has therefore rendered distinguished service in a field apart from education. I happen to know, because I meet him on sporting occasions, the amount of work that he has put into that job. When new schools are built, there can be a very rapid build-up of immigrants unless somebody is doing the detailed job of persuading parents of new arrivals that they really ought not to send their children to the most convenient school, although that is the natural reaction of everyone, but that it is in the interests of them and the cause of integration that there should be some dispersal to maintain the balance in the school and town populations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe passionately that this is the right policy, and I am very sorry that my own city of Birmingham does not follow such a policy. We now have schools in Birmingham with populations of 90 and 95 per cent. of immigrants, which does no service to anybody, certainly not the cause of integration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be other means of solving this problem, but I use it as an illustration of the forward-looking nature of the Luton county authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon.

courteous. As I understand the hon. Member, like so many hon. Members in this Committee, he docs not ask a question in order to receive information, but in order to get off his chest some point that he wishes to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Luton airport is of vital importance to the holiday trade, and particularly to the package holiday trade, but I will not, in the middle of my discourse on the education of immigrants, get so far off beat as to talk about the airport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Member will help me. I am sure we should not get into a discussion about the education of immigrants. It is quite right for the hon. Member to make a passing reference to the forward-looking policy of the Luton Corporation. I hope we will not get into a discussion on Luton airport, other than a passing reference as to whether it is good or bad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not anxious to talk about Luton Airport at this moment as I am not briefed on the subject and anything I have to say would not be of great value to the Committee, but I take note of the fact that one could perhaps mention it on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my own knowledge, the quality of the educational service in Luton is extremely good, particularly their sensitivity to changes in the social situation and the desire to deal with that position, even though it is not a popular thing to do. Many authorities have found that the easiest thing is to dismiss out of hand, ignore or procrastinate on the problems of the education of immigrants in our society. Whether one agrees with Luton's solutions or not, it is to their credit that they were prepared to grasp this nettle firmly, which they did with a great deal of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This raises the question that if Luton were to be governed from Bedford, some 42 miles away—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member will allow me to correct him, it is 20 miles away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for having the geographical facts at his fingertips. Would the same degree of sensitivity be possible in this situation? It was the view of officials in the Department of Education, and certainly the view
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
of Ministers and myself, that we achieved this response in Luton because here was an authority in control of its own situation, aware of the problems with which it had to deal and was far-sighted and courageous in trying to produce solutions to those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same way, in the matter of the youth service, which is something else of which I have personal experience, Luton did extremely well. Being a large motor manufacturing area with the considerable problems of any town that is, perhaps, over-concentrated on one or two industries, Luton made great strides in order to have a first-class youth service and a first-class leisure service. There is genuine feeling among the people of Luton, particularly in the borough of Luton, that all this is likely to go and that Luton will be submerged within the county structure which will be to their detriment. The policy making will be dominated by the county interests rather than by the town interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member earlier today chided me when I said, when referring to Birmingham, that again and again this is a real fear in our towns. I am not able to say at this moment just what the balance would be between the representatives of the county as a whole and the proportion of seats which it is supposed to allocate to Luton. One would imagine that these fears can only properly be considered when one knows how many representatives Luton will have on the new authority and whether their interests are to be submerged in the way they fear or whether those fears are unfounded. This is one of the things we wish to discuss in the process of this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also glad to say that recently Luton has made considerable strides in restructuring its local government machine in order to deal with the whole of the leisure services. I think hon. Members will know that most local authorities still, regrettably, have one committee structure to deal with parks, another to deal with baths, another to deal with libraries and another to deal with what cultural facilities there may be within the authority. It has been part of modern thinking in recent years that the question of leisure provision should be looked at as a whole by an authority, and I am glad to say that that thinking was started a year or two ago in the Ministry when I had some
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
responsibility for it and it is being continued by the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Luton was among the first authorities in the country to decide to amalgamate its committee structure and all these services. A gentleman who served me with distinction as the assistant director of the Sports Council for six years has just been appointed as the director or general manager—I am not sure of his actual designation—for all the recreational and leisure services of Luton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Luton intends to take the provision of leisure facilities seriously. It is entitled to say that it fears that the structure of the services it is trying to provide for the people of Luton is likely to be seriously jeopardised if the Government's proposals go through. One could say this of many services. One could talk for a long time about the services—the social services, the relationship of the social services, particularly the welfare services, education and housing. Those are matters on which it may be more appropriate for us to concentrate later when we decide which of the authorities, the first tier or second tier, should have responsibility for. various services. There is no doubt that Luton seriously thinks that the high level of the social services operated on behalf of its citizens might well be put in jeopardy by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that Luton is of great importance as a manufacturing centre, particularly as a motor manufacturing centre. This is almost repeating the Birmingham argument, which the Committee has already heard and on which I do not wish to dwell too long. But I must stress that the ability to control its own employment situation is of great importance to Luton. If decisions are to be taken at Bedford, 20 miles away, that could have a detrimental effect upon the whole industrial potential and the economic development of Luton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having met the mayor and some of his colleagues, I can say that the local councillors have strong feelings about the quality of the personal service which they render to the citizens of Luton. They urged me to raise this issue. They would go further and say that in their experience it might be difficult to find people of the right quality prepared to serve on a local authority 20 miles away. This is no idle comment. We know how difficult it is to get people to serve on local authorities operating in their imme-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
diate vicinity. It can be a hazardous business to get working men and women, housewives, for instance, with the time and facilities to travel long distances to serve a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important of all the fears in Luton surround the availability of local services and local officers to the public at large. It is a self-contained town. Those of us who know it well—and I have often refereed there—know how self-contained and independent it is and how vociferous the supporters of Luton Town can be. For generations, if the citizens of Luton had difficulties about health problems or salvage, or if they wanted to talk to the education officer about their child's school, they could hop on a bus, or walk, into town and could talk directly to those with administrative responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They believe that the change will cause tremendous inconvenience and that the close relationship that should exist in such a community will go, and that that will be to their detriment. That, too, is worth discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the fears of the people of the county borough of Luton, which is why this Amendment has found its way on to the Amendment Paper. Like several others in this group, it appears in the name of the hon. Member for Luton (Mr. Simeons). One can only hazard a guess as to why he, feeling so strongly about the fate being dealt to his city, has not found his way on to this Committee and has therefore left this case to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Gentleman saying that. However, as we go one after another through the Amendments causing offence to Conservative councillors, I am reminded of Charlie Smith, the man who was convicted in the brides in the bath murder case. When the first of these unfortunate victims turned up, when the first of his wives was found drowned in the bath, everybody said "Poor old Charlie Smith; what an unfortunate accident!" When a few months later he got married and next year the second bride was found drowned in the bath, everybody said, "What a remarkable coincidence! Poor old Charlie Smith!" When he got married the third time and, the third bride turned up dead in the bath, people said, "For goodness sake,

I was passing this way 	<i>en route</i> for Luton Airport when I was interrupted. The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Mad-dan), who asked about Luton airport has left—obviously not to Luton Airport, probably to Heathrow or somewhere else. There has been a tremendous build-up of traffic at Luton Airport. I cannot imagine that the neighbouring people in Bedfordshire, who suffer from the flight tracks of aeroplanes taking off from Luton Airport, are very pleased. To be honest, whatever the build-up there is or at any other airport, I do not believe that local people will ever be satisfied. The only satisfaction for them would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>
be to close the airport and allow peace and quiet to return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one of the curses of our time that we have to have airports and that airports have to be situated somewhere. All that one can say is that tens of thousands of Britishers enjoy good, cheap holidays by being able to use the facilities that such airports as Luton and Southend—which must never be forgotten in these discussions—are able to provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In spite of the hon. Gentleman's generous "plug", discussion of airports, whether Luton or Southend, is not relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are probably right, Sir Stephen. On the other hand, I am bound to say that Amendment No. 172 geographically involves the location of the airport. I am anxious not to go too far in discussing Luton airport, if only in order that I shall not demonstrate too overtly my ignorance of all matters connected with Luton airport. I think that it will be found that the proposal to have this new authority in South Bedford, involving not only the county borough of Luton, but the borough of Dunstable and the rural district of Luton and Leighton-Linslade, and parishes mentioned in the Amendment, affects the geographical location of Luton airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am on firmer ground when I turn to the attitude of the Luton and District Chamber of Trade. It has written to me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would like to reiterate our firm opposition to the present proposals changing Luton's present status, making it subordinate to an authority some 20 miles away.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"After a long struggle we attained County Borough status, and the over-all effect has been to make possible reforms and improvements which previously were held back by the County Authority.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe there is a natural grouping of urban and rural areas around Luton which would be far more suitable geographically and economically than the proposed regrouping.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have already expressed our views in more detail to the Minister of the Environment, and hope that in the Committee stage of the Bill we may see changes which will meet the views of the vast majority of Luton's populace."</p></blockquote>
What interests me in this letter is that it raises in the instance of Luton the question which was raised against me earlier in the day by the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
for Meriden (Mr. Speed) about Birmingham. His comment about the attachment of people in rural areas to their largely dominating urban authority, their neighbour in an urban authority, was taken up by the Minister, who showed some sympathy. Indeed, he not only had sympathy but he accepted the case, and he changed the Government's proposals for Birmingham wholesale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Luton and District Chamber of Trade say, that previousy the county had shown a considerable lack of sympathy with the problem which its members, as traders, industrialists and commercial undertakers, were having to face in Luton. I have no means of knowing whether that is so. One can only state the arguments as put by the Luton and District Chamber of Trade, but it is an argument that has to be met, just as it had to be met for Birmingham and its relationship to its neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is the view of a responsible body like the Luton and District Chamber of Trade that Luton's past relationships with the county have not been as harmonious as could be wished, particularly having regard to that body's responsibilities for trade and industry and the employment of many people, this is the moment when that view should be stated. When I met the representatives of Luton, it was clear that they felt that the interests of Luton would be submerged and would be secondary to the over-riding consideration of the county and the county area as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we agreed to suggest this Amendment. The Opposition view is not that we necessarily endorse these proposals, but it is our strong view that if we are changing the pattern of local government for 50 years ahead and any local authority in this country objects, it is entitled to have its objections stated here. That is what local democracy is about. It would be disastrous if people who felt aggrieved could not have their grievances stated, particularly because of the physical limitations on the number of Members who could sit on this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more important, not only should their claims and grievances be stated, but the Government's reply should be stated openly in order that a local authority may know where it is and test the validity of the Government's case for reject-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>839</span>
ing its proposals. It is for that purpose we have suggested our Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we will have a reasonably full explanation so that Luton, if not accepting the Government's case, at any rate will understand it better and will realise that its grievances have found proper expression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having had the temerity to correct the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) about the distance between Luton and Bedford, I am encouraged to involve myself in the debate to bring other aspects of the matter to the attention of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member for Small Heath that he has spoken by courtesy of the hon. Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones), because the initial Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton (Mr. Simeons) would not have been moved unless I had moved it. Here is an opportunity for him to pay some tribute at any rate to the joint interest that he and I have in Bedfordshire and the affairs of the county borough of Luton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what he said about the county borough of Luton having been well-governed under both Conservative and Socialist majorities. They have had a rapidly expanding town and all the problems associated with an increase in the industrial potential of Luton and a substantial increase in population too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when he referred to education and the difficulties that have had to be met in immigrant communities he would have done his case more justice had he recognised that this is a problem that applies essentially throughout Bedfordshire as a whole. In Bedford, itself, for example, the county town, there is a larger proportion of immigrant communities than in any other town in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about the proportion of immigrants to the total indigenous community, and not the numbers. Although the municipal borough of Bedford has had delegated powers in education it has essentially been the responsibility of the county council. I know from my service on the Select Committee for Immigrants that what has been achieved in the borough of Bedford and in the northern part of the county has been recognised as being of a high standard, both in education and welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>
There is not, therefore, a very strong case when one refers to the work that the local county and borough have done in education for immigrants. This is by no means a denigration of what they have done, but there is the wider interest of the county as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advocacy which the right hon. Member of Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) has made is one that could be made for many county boroughs in a similar situation to that of Luton. I am thinking of Nottingham. Leicester. Derby, and so on. I recognise that the right hon. Friend and his colleagues have moved the Amendment for the purpose of inquiry rather than as an Amendment through which they hope to make some effective change in the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Small Heath has applied himself essentially to the county borough of Luton. Although he has mentioned it in passing he has not dealt with at any length, or tried to justify, the creation of a south Bedford county organisation on the basis of Luton, Dunstable, the rural district of Luton, the urban district of Leighton-Linslade and the parishes of Hexton and Lilley, which are in the adjoining county of Hertfordshire. I do not know where Lilley Bottom lies, not having heard that designation before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member referred to my hon. Friend the Member for Luton (Mr. Simeons). He should also refer to the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel), because his constituency is involved entirely in the areas other than Luton which are mentioned in Amendment No. 172. There is, therefore, a substantial shortfall in the hon. Member's advocacy. I do not think that he has done the justice to the Amendment that we would expect him to do in normal circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody is more aware of my deficiencies than I am, especially in questions of advocacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the early part of his speech the hon. Member said that I should have referred courteously to him, because he formally moved the Amendment which allowed me to speak. I say to him, therefore, as the formal mover of this proposition—which presumably means that he has acted on behalf of his Friend the hon. Member for Luton (Mr. Simeons)—that I confidently
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
expect that any deficiencies in my speech will now be made up by him in his speech, so that by the time we have both finished the Committee will have had a full and lively appraisal of all the arguments in favour of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance that I proposed the Amendment so that I could hear him make his case. I always enjoy listening to his advocacy, and I am sorry that on this Amendment he has not reached the standards that one expects. I do not denigrate the asides which he brought into his speech, because they were most enjoyable. That is something that my hon. Friends and I would miss with great regret.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing that is quite clear about the Amendment is that the limitations of the hon. Member are obviously greater than mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is losing his modesty now—perhaps a customary part of his advocacy on some occasions. Certainly there is no substantial case for the creation of a new non-metropolitan county. The right hon. Member did not tell us what effect this would have on the proposed county of Bedford as a whole, and it is not my place to develop this argument, which can safely be left to those who will be speaking for the Government. My purpose in rising was to fill in some of the omissions for which the right hon. Member was responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is poring over what I believe is the only one-inch map in the room. I do not know whether he has located Lilley Bottom; I have not been able to find it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister refers to the administrative area map which he has supplied to the Committee, and delineates the authorities mentioned in this Amendment, he will see that it is clear that this area is a compact, more or less rectangular area, which is cut off from Bedfordshire, whereas at the moment it forms only an appendix to the major part of the county. It is understandable that an area which contains the urban areas of Luton and Dunstable should have real fears that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>842</span>
will find itself a mere appendix to a substantial area with Bedford about 20 miles away. There are grounds for their fears. Not only is it a compact area, it is essentially different from the rest of Bedfordshire. Hon Members will know that not only is Luton a major industrial centre but that the area mentioned in the Amendment is part and parcel of the Chiltern Hills. Once one leaves the area which we have asked should be created a new county one gets into the much flatter, entirely different Clay Vale area. There is a real distinction between these two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that if the Minister is conscious of the need to preserve areas of great natural beauty, his local authorities should be designed towards this end. All members of the Committee will agree that the Chiltern Hills form one of our most valuable pieces of landscape—all the more valuable because it lies so near the large population of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister accepts the Amendment he will be creating an authority which could play an extremely useful part in preserving the essential character of the Chiltern Hills. If he resists it he will lose an opportunity of preserving the area. He will lose an opportunity of creating a small county, but one which is relatively self-contained and different in character—both in its work life and its geographical features—from the rest of the county. I ask him seriously to consider this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I raised the question of the Birmingham Airport with the Minister who replied on the West Midlands Amendments he was kind enough to say that if I were to raise a specific case with him at some future time he would be happy to give me a reply. Perhaps I may ask who will own Luton Airport. We may be able to get some satisfaction for the hon. Member for Luton (Mr. Simeons) out of this stage of the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) accused my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) of poor advocacy. My right hon. Friend used the best possible advocacy in an absolutely hopeless case. I think that these are the most hopeless series of Amendments which have come before the Committee so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>843</span>
The hon. Member for Luton (Mr. Simeons) is entitled, as a patriotic supporter of his constituency, to suggest to the Committee, although he is not a member of it, various means by which Luton can be the big fish with a lot of small fish attracted towards it, even though in order to create this county he leaves Bedfordshire. He crosses over, he goes into Hertfordshire, he goes into Buckinghamshire, he takes little bits of everywhere to the greater glory of Luton. He is their Member, and this Committee and the House give a great deal of latitude to a Member who seeks to glorify his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I was heartened when my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) said that the Amendment was exploratory; that this is not really Opposition policy; that they really just wanted to know what the Government intend to do. My reaction was to say to myself: "Thank God for that."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend by his Amendments—I suspect that it is not his Amendment but has somehow got his name on it—and my right hon. Friend—is not as ambitious as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Luton but they create a tiny county in south Bedfordshire that really is Luton and its rural district, with Dunstable added on. Even they, although they are not as thieving from other authorities as the hon. Gentleman is, would stoop to go over the boundaries into Hertfordshire to pinch Lilley Bottom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is really not a viable county. It is tiny. It is nonsense to say that because Luton is 20 miles from Bedford it cannot be administered from Bedford; to say that Luton has immigration problems; to say that the chamber of commerce at Luton does not like being part of Bedford and neither does Luton Council. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) put his finger right on the spot. I do not think that there is a county borough in this country which could not raise all these sorts of objections, and many of them have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurence Reed). I am sure that he and I could make a very valid case on nearly every one of those grounds: that Bolton is a well-administered town; that it has an immigration problem; that it is miles from Manchester, which it does not particu-
	<span class='label label-info column'>844</span>
larly like. We could make a very good case for the new county of Bolton instead of the county of Greater Manchester.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is here suggested would be a completely non-viable, tiny little county which would have no meaning within the structure of local government. If we consider the representations of every county borough and every chamber of commerce, and the different problems of each particular county borough that comes before us, we would not now be on this part of the Schedule; we would still be dealing with Greater Manchester.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has ridiculed the Amendment and, indeed, the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton (Mr. Simeons), I congratulate my hon. Friend for bringing this before the Committee and the pains he has taken in drawing an Amendment of this sort to put a new county before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we first clear up this very difficult problem of where is Lilley Bottom? I find by reference to my one-inch map through my spyglass that Lilley Bottom sits comfortably—I might say cheek by jowl—with Cockernhoe and Cox Green.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, let me say that Luton is an important town. It has been administered splendidly over the past years, whatever party has been in office, and it will continue, like other county boroughs which are forming part of the new counties, as as an important town, governing not only Luton itself but taking part in the government of the county, and taking a substantial part. If we look at the figures, we see that Luton will be in control of over one-third of the county. It is 37 per cent. of the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it really has nothing to complain about in the influence which it will have within the county as the county is drawn in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us again be clear on this. The Amendment will not alter the functions of Luton in any way. As the Bill is drawn, Luton will be a district within a non-metropolitan county. The Amendment makes a new non-metropolitan county. It will still be a district in that, and so its functions are not changed. The argument of the hon. Member for Small Heath was, I thought, an argument for the unitary authority, rather than for a new county. The only conclusion I could draw from that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>845</span>
that the whole purpose of the Amendment is to produce a county in which Luton would be the dominating town and the dominating influence. Indeed, in this new county as it is suggested, Luton would have, not the 37 per cent. which it would have in the county as drawn in the Bill, but 63 per cent. So it would be a very dominating town within that county. I can assure the Committee that we had demands for this from all over the country. I have noted 24 proposals for new counties. All of them were on the same principle, of a town trying to form a county which it would dominate. We have set our face against that because we are determined to produce a balanced two-sphere system of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Amendment were accepted, we would have a new county, South Bedford, the population of which would be only 251,207. We should have the existing Bedfordshire reduced to 304,933. We would have Buckinghamshire cut down to 418,000 and Cambridgeshire reduced to 511,000. Three out of those four would have only four smaller counties in the whole country. One would be at the bottom of the league of counties, the new South Bedford, and the new Bedfordshire as proposed by this Amendment would only be two from the bottom of the table. This is merely, as the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) said, for the glorification of Luton. In order to produce this new county, Luton has, as it were, scratched around the neighbouring counties, seized a part from Buckinghamshire, including Milton Keynes, and seized a part from Cambridge and a little part from Hertfordshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would raise resentment from all the areas around. The boundaries as they were drawn in the Bill were drawn up after consultation with all the authorities in this area, and they represent the wishes of all the authorities in this part of England except Luton. It is purely a scheme put forward by Luton as against all its neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under those circumstances, the Government cannot accept it. It may be, as I said on other Amendments, that 20 years hence we may have to think again about this, but at the moment it would only be destructive of the existing counties in this area, and not constructive. I am sure that Luton can find its place,
	<span class='label label-info column'>846</span>
and a very important place, in influencing over one-third of the County of Bedford. Its fear of being governed by Bedford, only 20 miles away, is really an exaggeration. Luton will have a big part to play in the Bedfordshire county, and I hope it will be satisfied with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the compelling arguments of the Minister in the nature of the Bill that we have before us, and I am satisfied that the task which we have set ourselves on this side of the Committee, of seeing that Luton's case has been put and answered, has been adequately fulfilled. I must just say to my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) that there is nothing wrong with Luton proposing a series of arrangements which are for the glorification of Luton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is, indeed, the responsibility of the local authorities in the County Borough of Luton, as it is of every other authority. I hope he will not take his strictures so far as to suggest that when we discuss other towns, he will feel equally strongly that they should not have their case stated. The Minister's remarks were much more pertinent to the situation. My argument was for a unitary authority, the principle of which the Committee had decided against earlier. That decision having been taken, that Luton cannot remain a unitary authority as it wishes, I well understand that they wish to do the best they can for their citizens.
