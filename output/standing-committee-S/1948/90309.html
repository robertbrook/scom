	<section>
	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. John Wheatley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the proceedings on the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would offer no objection to that, although, with the present pressure of work on Members, meeting on two days a week will impose a fairly heavy strain on us. There are a number of Bills in Committee, many of which affect Scottish interests, and upon which Committees Scottish Members will have to serve. While we shall do our best to co-operate with the Government in this respect, I trust that if from time to time we ask for modifications of the strain, they will be granted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>Resolved,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the proceedings on the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we start our proceedings I should like to make these announcements. I would remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with this Bill. I do not propose to direct that it should be read, but if any Members of the Committee desire to see it they will find copies of it here on the Table. I should also like to call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of Amendments, as moving them without notice causes inconvenience. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. What do you mean, Mr. Mathers, when you say that adequate notice must be given of Amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1960</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to Amendments which words appear on the Order Paper as starred Amendments, which would mean that they had been put down the day before. Amendments should be put down with more than one day's notice in order that they may be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>â€”(SCOPE AND GENERAL CONDITIONS OF LEGAL AID.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 8, to leave out, "Part of this Act provides for," and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the three next following sections provide for, and (save as hereinafter mentioned) relate only to."</p></blockquote>
This is merely a drafting Amendment, anticipating a new Clause which will be moved later dealing with legal advice in an intermediate stage. I do not think that it would be suitable to discuss that new Clause at this stage, and I trust it will meet the convenience of the Committee if we merely accept this as a drafting Amendment, and consider the merits of the proposed new Clause it anticipates when that Clause arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will offer no objection to that course, but we reserve our rights to discussion when the new Clause arises. We will regard this as a paving Amendment, making it possible, if the Committee so desires, to incorporate the proposed new Clause. On that we concur with the Lord Advocate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Niall Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Lord Advocate explain exactly what this Amendment means? It is quite plain that the next three Clauses apply to proceedings before courts and tribunals in Scotland. Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman mean that the new Clause will come in after the next three Clauses, or where? Will the new Clause be treated as being applicable to the next three Clauses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new Clause will come up for consideration after we have exhausted the other Clauses. As the right hon. and gallant Member for the Scottish Universities (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) says, this is merely paving the way, and its true appreciation will be seen when we consider the new Clause. This Amendment is designed merely to indicate that the first four Clauses only deal with legal aid in connection with proceedings
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1961</span>
in court, or in tribunals, if they are extended to tribunals. We shall then go on to consider legal advice in cases where it may be desirable to get legal advice without resorting to actual court proceedings. Subsequently in the Bill we shall deal with legal advice purely from the point of view of legal advice given orally in small matters. If the hon. Member waits until we reach the new Clause I think the reason for this paving Amendment, as it has been described, will become more obvious. It is difficult to explain it in full detail without going into the merits of the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is really divided into two parts which, according to the Bill itself, can be quoted separately. Would it be the intention of the Lord Advocate to bring in the new Clause, which refers to the first Part of the Bill, after we have disposed of Clause 15, or is it to be taken after the end of the second Part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that we are entirely in your hands, Mr. Mathers. I should imagine that according to normal procedure the new Clause could be moved only after the rest of the Clauses have been examined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly usual. I have not looked at that matter up to the moment, but I should think that rule would still apply, notwithstanding the fact cited by the hon. and gallant Member for West Edinburgh (Lieut.-Commander Hutchison).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In calling the next Amendment in the name of the hon.

I put down my Amendment in this form because I felt there was some doubt about the right of appeal to the House of Lords, in view of the words

I was permitting my ignorance to give me the opportunity of raising this matter, because occasionally if a person is not too clear, his ignorance has the advantage of permitting him to raise the question in Committee. I want to know why, in view of the fact that I do not see this in the English Bill, it is necessary to incorporate the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"on appeal from the Court of Session."</p></blockquote>
I am anxious to do two things in this connection. First, I want the people of Scotland to have the same right of appeal as the people of England. I do not know why they have never had it in the past. I also want to know why it is necessary to include the words I have suggested should be deleted.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the First Schedule to the English Bill mention is made of the rights of an assisted person to appear before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. That does not appear in the Scottish Bill, and we are naturally anxious to know why that should be. It seems to me that it may easily happen that a Scotsman or a Scottish domiciled person who is employed in some trade or commerce overseas, perhaps in one of the Colonies, could become involved in legal proceedings from which ultimately there may be recourse to the Judicial Committee, either on a point of law or of principle.

It seems eminently reasonable that this provision should apply to Scotland, because, after all, of the people who inhabit these islands I think the Scots are the most travel-minded and are the most likely to be found in remote parts of the Empire. Moreover, the Scots have a great love of the law, and it is quite possible that they may find themselves involved in some way in legal proceedings. We think they should have that right of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have allowed the hon. and gallant Gentleman to make that point, but it puts him completely out of Order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fact that appeals do lie to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from events which take place in the Colonies. They may lie on criminal matters. I

would recall to the Committeeâ€”and the Lord Advocate may possibly remember this caseâ€”a well known case that occurred a number of years ago concerning a sailor who was involved in a brawl in an hotel in Cyprus, in the course of which, unfortunately, a person was killed. The sailor was charged with murder before the local court at Limassol in Cyprus. On appeal, the conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Cyprus, but he was given permission to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on a point of law. That man was an Englishman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose he had been a Scotsman and that this provision had been inserted in our law, then he would have been eligible for this assistance in what obviously must be a costly matter. The Lord Advocate may possibly remember the case. It aroused a good deal of interest at the time. It was the case of Rex v. Sutton in 1933. I think there is a case for giving Scotsmen the right to go the highest court in the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument is not in Order. This Bill applies to legal matters arising in Scotland. Matters arising furth of Scotland would not come within this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendments are of an exploratory nature, I think. I have no hesitation in assuring hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that within the Bill we have taken powers to make legal aid available in the courts in which people litigating in Scotland would normally have to appear, whether in civil or in criminal courts. As hon. Members probably know, there is ho appeal in criminal cases beyond the High Court of Justiciary. In civil cases there are appeals to the Court of Session and from the Court of Session to the House of Lords. There are no appeals from Scotland from the Scottish courts to the Privy Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the wording of the Clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦. before the House of Lords on appeal from the Court of Session."</p></blockquote>
is simply because the previous words refer to courts and tribunals in Scotland. The House of Lords sitting on Scottish appeals is sitting as a Scottish court, although, in fact, as we know, it sits in the Palace of Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: it may be or it may not be, but that is the fact. To prevent any of the legalistic people suggesting that the House of Lords, since it sits in London, is not a court sitting in Scotland, we adopt this form or words. Accordingly, I would submit to the Committee that since we remove any doubt that the House of Lords, although sitting in London, is still a Scottish Court of Appeal, the framing of the Clause as it stands is unexceptionable, and since there are no appeals from cases in Scotland to the Privy Council there is no point in the second part of the Amendment. I trust, therefore, that both parties will see their way to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What, then, would be the position of a Scotsman abroad who became involved in some proceedings whereby an appeal was taken to the Privy Council?

Members of the Committee that in such a case the man would be able to take advantage of the provisions of the English Bill, because, as these Measures are framed, nationality is not the determining factor at all. It is a question of a person's litigating in certain courts. A person in England, in an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, would be entitled to take advantage of the provisions of the English Bill. There is provision in this Bill whereby, if he were resident in Scotland, he could get the preliminary work done in Scotland with a view to taking judicial proceedings in England before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the reason why appeals to the Judicial Committee are not taken from our Scottish courts but are taken to the House of Lords. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbartonshire (Mr. McKinlay) was speaking of a citizen of Eire or a citizen of Ayr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This seems to be a rather interesting situation. It appears that any foreigner who happens to have lived in Scotland for a month or two months can avail himself of the services of the Scottish courts by this Bill, but that if a Scotsman becomes involved in a legal dispute in the Colonies, and wishes to go to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, he is unable to obtain assistance.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise not to reply, but to raise a point of Order. All this discussion may be quite relevant on the Question "That the Clause stand part of the Bill," but I cannot see what relevancy it has in relation to this Amendment, which is merely a question whether or not we should leave out certain parts of the Clause dealing with appeals to the House of Lords, and whether we should include appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. I have explained to the Committee that there are no such appeals on cases arising in Scotland to the Judicial Committee, and I have explained why the insertion of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"on appeal from the Court of Session"</p></blockquote>
was made. I suggest that discussion of the extent and ramification of the Bill is not in Order on this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Bill applies solely to Scotland and those resident in Scotland, but is there not a difficulty created by the fact that one of the courts sits outside Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is covered by what I said, that this Bill deals with cases which arise in Scotland and not cases arising furth of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carmichael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not satisfied with the statement about the position of Scots people in relation to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. I understand from the Lord Advocate that we have no appeal from Scotland to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Well, I know that, but I want to know why. This may not be the Bill to deal with that question, because we are concerned here with financial aid to people. Still, we have no evidence yet that the people in Scotland are to get financial aid in all their appeals. If it is true, as the Lord Advocate said just now, that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the highest court in the land, why is it that Scottish people cannot now appeal to that court, in precisely the same way as the English people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have considered this widely enough. I thought the hon. Member was rising to withdraw his Amendment.

I am removing the first part which was out of Order by accepting your guidance and leaving the words in. Surely, the second part of my Amendment is in Order? This is an Amendment to safeguard people making appeals in Scotland in the same way as people in England are safeguarded. Surely that is not an unreasonable request. It is better that the matter should be cleared up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>â€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give the Lord Advocate an opportunity to make the matter clear, if that is the wish of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there is a great deal of confusion on this point. The House of Lords deals with appeals in this country, whether they come from Scottish or English courts, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council deals with appeals from the Colonies. There is no rivalry between the two. They are separate courts with separate functions, and each is the supreme court in its own sphere. People in England have no preferential rights of appeal over the people in Scotland. The reason for the inclusion of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the English Measure is this: The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council sits in England to hear appeals from those other countries, and those who practice before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council are English solicitors. Therefore, any litigant from abroad, whether he is a Scotsman or an Englishman, will be required to go through the machinery under the English Bill. That is why there is this reference in the English Bill and not in our Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could not be any action in which a person was receiving aid under the Scottish Bill that could come before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. On the other hand, a Scotsman returning from the Colonies who wanted to make an appeal before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council could take advantage of this Bill for the preliminary steps necessary to make an appeal before the Judicial Committee of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1970</span>
the Privy Council. It is not a question of residency or nationality, but merely a question of any litigant in the Scottish courts being entitled to the benefits of this Measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carmichael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 6, at the end, to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that regulations shall not provide for such variation by way of excluding from those proceedings in connection with which legal aid may be given any of the proceedings described in Part I of the First Schedule to this Act or by the addition to the proceedings described in Part II of that Schedule of proceedings of any other description."</p></blockquote>
This subsection seems to be of considerable importance as it gives the regulation-making authority power to limit or extend the scope of the Bill. It seems to us that unless a proviso of this nature is included, it would be possible for the regulation-making authority to transfer some of the courts mentioned in Part I of the First Schedule to Part II, and thereby encroach upon the rights of litigants. Furthermore, this can also happen in the case of the criminal courts mentioned in the First Schedule, with the consequent risk of injustice to some accused person. It would seem that by a stroke of the pen on the part of the Secretary of State, or whoever makes the regulations, a whole range of issues, such as appeals to the Lands Valuation Appeal Court on questions of assessment, could be transferred to the list of excepted proceedings. We consider that in a matter of such importance as this, where alterations of a wide nature are made, it should not be done by regulations, even though there is the safeguard of the affirmative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Second Reading Debate, the Lord Advocate stressed the point that the new scheme had to be started in a modest way. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Everyone will, I think, realise that we are starting off in this scheme in a modest way; as experience shows how it can best be expanded and developed, then it would be the desire of every one that it should so be done."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th December; Vol. 459, c. 1463.]</p></blockquote>
We agree with those remarks. We agree that we have to proceed with a certain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1971</span>
degree of caution. Therefore, we do not object to additional services being included in Part I by means of the regulation procedure, but we say, if the situation arises where some court or some issue which may come before a court has to be withdrawn from Part I and placed in Part II of the First Schedule, that it should be done, not by regulation, but by an amending Act. We think that our Amendment is a wise one and will remedy what might be a dangerous loophole that at some future date might operate against the interests of some litigant or person accused on a criminal charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee will recollect that the Cameron Committee advised in their Report that any scheme of legal aid should be as flexible as possible; that experience might show that certain things considered desirable at an early stage might have to be removed, and that certain cases which might be excluded in the early stages might have to be absorbed into the scheme. We have tried to follow that principle of flexibility by providing in general terms that legal aid shall be available in courts and tribunals, and then, by virtue of the Schedule, limiting the scheme's scope in the initial stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have done that because we were afraid of overloading the machine. Nothing could be worse than to overload the scheme at the start, with the result that it might break down. We thought it better to proceed modestly, to find out how the scheme was working and then to consider what further types of legal aid could properly be brought in. We do not want to do that by passing an amending Act on every occasion, because we might be doing this by stages. Accordingly, we adopted the method whereby there could be these alterations by means of the affirmative resolution procedure, which enables both sides of the House to canvass the merits of the case before deciding to adopt the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment seeks to impose a rigidity on this procedure. In the course of consultations with the legal profession, certain views were expressed as to which courts should be included, and we have taken a chance and included them. It might emerge that it is impracticable to give legal aid in certain courts, or that there was a certain abuse of certain types
	<span class='label label-info column'>1972</span>
of action, making it desirable to remove these actions from the scope of the legal aid provisions. The First Schedule, which this Amendment seeks to alter, contains not only the types of court in which legal aid will be given, but the types of action that will be excluded initially from the operations of the scheme. This Amendment would shackle the scheme and prevent us from taking advantage of experience in order to have the most self-sufficient and satisfactory legal aid scheme possible in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not simply that we want to remove any of the courts or exclude certain types of action merely by a stroke of the pen. That would require to be done by the affirmative resolution procedure, when Parliament would have its full say in the matter. I am convinced that it would be adverse to the good working of this scheme to provide this rigidity. The action we have taken in excluding certain types of actions is because we feel that to open the door to all types of actions might completely overload the scheme in its initial stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be we shall find that a certain type of action is subject to abuse. Surely we should be very ill-advised if, in consultation with the Law Society and other interested bodies it was thought necessary to remove one type of action, we had to go to the House of Commons with an amending Bill. That would not be a practicable procedure. The same applies also in the case of the courts. If at the end of the day we found, which I trust will not be the case, that in some of the minor courts there was difficulty in providing legal aid, surely the affirmative resolution procedure would be a sufficient safeguard if we decided, after consultation, it was necessary to exclude those courts. I ask the Committee to leave us with this flexibility which is considered to be necessary from the professional point of view, and not to restrict us by this Amendment, which would mean recourse to Parliament at successive intervals to deal with questions that are really matters of machinery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate much of what the Lord Advocate says but I do not find myself entirely convinced by it. I agree it brings in a slightly more rigid element so far as taking courts and issues from Part I and putting them into Part II is concerned.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1973</span>
but it is a safeguard for the public to insist that any rights which may be withdrawn should be discussed by Parliament. It is more satisfactory that that should be done in a Bill rather than by resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have been in Parliament for a number of years know that Debates on regulations and the like are somewhat circumscribed. It is not easy to cover all the matters which one would like to raise, and very often they are ruled out of Order. Whilst there is no objection to adding by regulation to the first part of the First Schedule, there is a point of substance in our objection to removing from that part of the First Schedule except by Act of Parliament courts and issues which are at present there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Lord Advocate to think over the matter again. A look at the Schedule will show that there are not a very large number of courts and issues involved, and I cannot imagine that many amending Acts would be required to be brought before the House. There are only eight different courts or tribunals mentioned in the First Part, and at the worst there would not be more than eight Bills. It is not seriously suggested that any more than one or two of these courts would be overloaded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman started by talking about overloading the machine, and went on to imply that only the minimum was brought in and it was intended to see what more could be brought in at a later date. He went on rather paradoxically to suggest that in future it might be proved that they had already brought in too much. It seems to me that this is the time to make up our minds what are the absolutely basic things on which a person should have a right to get legal aid to have it brought before the courts. It is not a question of the courts being overloaded with any particular form of case. We have decided on a Health Service scheme.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I finish my sentence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to correct one point made by the hon. Gentleman. I did not say that the courts would be overloaded, but that the scheme would be overloaded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to understand what that means. In what way would the scheme be overloaded? Would it be costing too much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can it be overloaded except because it is costing too much, because it is clogging the machine through the courts being overloaded, or because there are to few solicitors to give speedy advice? There are only two ways in which this could possibly arise. Surely in any case if it were to be found that there were abuses, those abuses and the procedure could be rectified through the local committees in each 	<i>probabilis causa litigandi</i>. That would be the correct way of dealing with it rather than allowing the machine to get grossly overloaded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the local committees themselves will be able to judge in the future what sort of cases are to be taken and whether there is any hope of success. It would be wrong to make any provision for the basic rights we are providing in this Bill to be reduced except by fresh legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Gomme-Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Lord Advocate that undue rigidity would be a very great mistake. We do not want to do anything which would result in that, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. N. Macpherson) said, if we as a sovereign body decide on certain things which the lieges of Scotland should have in the way of privileges, they ought to be quite definite. Therefore, we should make it perfectly clear that there is machinery for it, but that it is not machinery which will take away from them the rights that Parliament had decided they should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite sure that the Lord Advocate's arguments meet that case. I should like to feel that what we say the lieges should have they will have, and that there shall not be any question of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1975</span>
watering down those privileges by regulation, but that only by Act of Parliament can the scheme be amended. I do not feel too happy about the Clause as it stands, and I support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference between us comes down to the point as to whether the modifications of the scheme which the Lord Advocate indicated might have to be made should be by affirmative resolution or by Act of Parliament. This Amendment does not shackle the Executive. It is merely deciding on the procedure which the Executive must adopt, if it wished to modify the provisions laid down in this part of the Statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are admittedly embarking on a rather novel course here, which has brought to light the extreme touchiness of our Scottish people in regard to anything connected with the courts. The great difficulty will be of being sure that all objections have been met. I wonder if the Lord Advocate would not find in this case that the longest way round might not be the shortest way home. The procedure of amending would not in practice be any more cumbersome or difficult than the procedure of the affirmative resolution which here he seeks to commend to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real difficulty will be in the discussions and negotiations outside Parliament. When and if the Lord Advocate can come to the House of Commons and say that these have been adjusted and negotiated outside, that the Government come forward with a proposal which has been agreed in consultation with the Law Society and that the Government had decided on one class of action, I am sure that Parliament would not wish to be sticky or make difficulties in the matter. The real difficulty is if, in consultation with the Law Society, the Government and the outside people find themselves at loggerheads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equal delay would take place whether we were working under an affirmative resolution or presenting an amending Bill. Our procedure in Scotland is expeditious, because in practice a Bill is referred to this Grand Committee. I do not think that the Lord Advocate has in practice found that the Scottish Grand Committee makes undue difficulty. When the Executive seeks to have power over the courts, Parliament should be fully con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1976</span>
sulted in the matter. The provision of an affirmative resolution is merely one consultation in either House of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The well-established procedure of the passing of an Act of Parliament is one which we might retain to ourselves here when we are embarking upon a course which admittedly has given rise to a good deal of uneasiness in Scotland. That uneasiness is now being dissipated, but it has taken a good deal of trouble and argument. We on this side of the Committee know what it has meant in a great deal of correspondence and trouble. It may well be that the uneasiness in Scotland would be less if it were said that we would alter this provision if it were necessary by Act of Parliament rather than by a resolution of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue here is whether the sanction of Parliament to the proposal of the Executive should be by the procedure of a resolution or the more lengthy procedure of an amending Act. I suggest that under the circumstances the Lord Advocate might concede the point and allow the Amendment, which suggests that any changes should be made by a purely Scottish Act. There would be no delay, and actually it would be a more satisfactory procedure than the procedure of the affirmative resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite different in the case of Scotland to that of England, because we can have the discussion here in the Scottish Grand Committee and that discussion can take place outside the ambit of the House itself. We are not, therefore, limited as the English would be limited, by the procedure of the passing of an Act of Parliament. We on this side of the Committee attach a great deal of importance to the principle, and we would be rather unwilling to consent, without further good reason, to the procedure of an affirmative resolution, which the Government seeks to commend to us on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been struggling all morning to try to get the hang of the Amendment. It is a very difficult task for a layman, in wading through this Bill, to know exactly what subsection (4) means. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Regulations made for the purpose of the last foregoing subsectionâ€”</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) shall not provide for legal aid being given in connection with proceedings before any court or tribunal before which persons
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1977</span>
have no right and are not normally allowed to be heard by counsel or a solicitor;"</p></blockquote>
I must confess that I have not any fixed notion of what kind of court is meant there. Then we get the Amendment, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that regulations shall not provide for such variation by way of excluding from those proceedings in connection with which legal aid may be given any of the proceedings described in Part I of the First Schedule to this Act or by the addition to the proceedings described in Part II of that Schedule of proceedings of any other description."</p></blockquote>
Frankly, I give in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like some member of the legal fraternity here to tell me what this is all about. I come here as an ordinary layman in the hope that I shall at least understand whether we are amending or approving a Bill and if so what we are amending and approving. If there is any layman who understands the jingle that we have in this Amendment, I would be surprised. I cannot understand it at all. Could the Lord Advocate tell us what kind of a court or tribunal exists in Scotland before which persons have no rights, and are not normally to be heard by counsel or solicitor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Mathers. At the same time I cannot accept that that can be separated from this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon.

He generally prides himself on his great skill in unravelling points which sometimes hon. Members beside him find more difficult than he does, but this morning we have from
	<span class='label label-info column'>1978</span>
him a complete admission of failure. I dislike legislation by reference as much as the hon. Gentleman does, but I should have thought that it did not require very great mental agility to understand what the Amendment seeks to do. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read and studied them very carefully for at least the first hour, when the hon. Gentleman was not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My train yesterday was an hour and a half late. The hon.

I thought he was intervening to speak about the subject of the Amendment, I gave way to him, but I shall be very careful never to give way to him again unless I am sure that he is going to put a reasonable point to me. In the First Schedule the hon. Gentleman will find the courts which we think no regulation should prevent any litigant from attending because of the legal aid not being forthcoming which the Bill seeks to make available to litigants who may be unable to provide from their own purses the expenses which the trial of their case may necessitate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman mind repeating his interpretation of the Amendment so that his own Front Bench can understand it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were to do so, the rule of undue repetition might be enforced against me. Our Amendment seeks to provide that in no case shall the litigant be prevented from having his cause duly pleaded in the appropriate court, because that is what the Bill seeks to provide. The hon. Member for West Renfrew can shake his head, but he will not convince me on that point.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1979</span>
I ask the Lord Advocate to say whether, after all, this Amendment can be accepted as providing an easier and more facile way of dealing with this matter than the affirmative resolution procedure. The Lord Advocate called in aid the Cameron Committee, an excellent Committee presided over by a first-class lawyer, perhaps the very best in Scotland at the present time. I know that the Committee, particularly the Chairman, were in favour of flexibility. I consider that by turning down our Amendment the Lord Advocate is paradoxically defeating the flexibility which he and the Cameron Committee desire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned about litigants who will go to the sheriff court, perhaps the most ancient court of all in Scotland. My right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Scottish Universities (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) said there was great touchinessâ€”there always has beenâ€”in Scotland, particularly among the poorer classes of litigant. The hon. Member for West Renfrew will remember the celebrated case of Peter Peebles in "Redgauntlet." We do not want any increased touchiness in Scotland with regard to litigation generally. I am particularly concerned with the sheriff court, and I feel that unless something is done to clear away the doubts of those going to the sheriff court, either by acceptance of the Amendment or reconsidering the whole position before the Report stage, there may be increased uneasiness in Scotland on this point. I feel sure that the Lord Advocate would be anxious to avoid that, and I hope that he will now give a further reply to what has been said by my right hon. and gallant Friend. However, let him say nothing about his hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrew.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to worry the Committee with a further statement, but we ought to get the matter into its proper perspective. I cannot accept the Amendment. As the right hon. and gallant Member for the Scottish Universities (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) pointed out, this is purely a question of machinery. In principle we are at one with each other, and the only issue is whether the machinery to be used for extension or contraction of the scheme should be an amending Act of Parliament or the affirmative resolution pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1980</span>
cedure. We all agree about the flexibility of the scheme. In my negotiations with representative members of the profession, there was not a great deal of argument-there was a great deal of explanation and harmony on both sidesâ€”and no uneasiness was expressed about the proposal to adopt the affirmative resolution procedure. The question is whether it would be better to have the affirmative resolution procedure, as we propose, or an amending Act, as the Amendment proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will test it very simply. To take the second part of the First Schedule: we may desire to include among the excepted proceedings one other type of action because we find so much abuse of it that it is overloading the machine and making the machine unworkable. The Opposition suggest that we should bring in an amending Act of Parliament in order to do so. Would it not be much more fitting to use the affirmative resolution procedure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of this scheme will turn on trial and error. All members of the profession whom I have consulted are agreed that we are going into unknown territory to a certain extent and that experience may show that the scheme should be amended in one way or the other. Immediate experience might indicate that a certain contraction of the scheme should take place, and then, in the passage of a year or two, it might be realised that we could restore the 	<i>status quo</i>. It is suggested that we should have an amending Act of Parliament to do the first step and a subsequent amending Act of Parliament to revert to the 	<i>status, quo</i>, when the affirmative resolution procedure is a much more expeditious means of doing it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not object to affirmative resolution procedure in the first instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment is quite clear. The Opposition want Acts of Parliament to deal with cases where we are taking the right to legal aid away from certain courts and also where we are adding to the list of excepted proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can one be done without the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1981</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was taking the test of adding to the list of excepted proceedings which, according to the Amendment, would require an amending Act of Parliament, and then, in the passage of a year or two, further experience showing that the original proceedings could be brought back into the scope of the Bill. By the procedure outlined in the Amendment a further Act of Parliament would be required to repeal the original one because we could not by affirmative resolution repeal the original amending Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances it is obvious that we are taking a sledgehammer to crack a peanut in the working out of this scheme. I know it is put forward with the best of intentions but I must impress on the Committee that it would defeat the flexibility which we seek, prevent our going ahead as smoothly as we wish on the trial and error basis, and impose far too great a strain on the Scottish Grand Committee. I must disagree with the right hon. and gallant Gentleman when he says that we can get our Bills through smoothly in the Scottish Grand Committee. I hope that hon. Members will not be beguiled by what took place yesterday, because that was a most exceptional proceeding. Our experience is that in the Scottish Grand Committee, Scottish hon. Membersâ€”quite properly; I am not making any criticismâ€”take advantage of speaking because of the fuller opportunity they get than they sometimes get elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We desire to examine this in a businesslike fashion, and the Lord Advocate has advanced arguments to which we must give serious attention. We also attach importance to the next Amendment, and I wonder whether it would be premature to ask the Lord Advocate if he could indicate whether he could meet us on that Amendment. If he can, we should be very glad not to press this Amendment. The argument about Scottish hon. Members desiring to discuss these matters was not a very strong one, because they desire to discuss them so that they may be ventilated for the benefit of the people of Scotland. I see that the hon. Member for West Renfrew (Mr. Scollan) is far from happy yet and feels that he does not understand this so far. If he, a man of exceptional ability and unusual application, does not understand it, many of his
	<span class='label label-info column'>1982</span>
constituents, who may not share his powerful mental equipment and may not have his assiduity, may be even more confused, and it is for the benefit of such as them that the Bill is being passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not insist upon dividing the Committee on this Amendment in view of the explanations which the Lord Advocate has given, but we certainly hope that he will be able to meet us on the further safeguards which we wish to introduce because we are not content with the Lord Advocate's acceptance of the transfer of one class of cases because, in the view of the Executive, they are subject to abuse. To leave the Executive the power of deciding that the citizens are abusing the right of access to the courts is a step which should be taken with very great reluctance indeed, and should be hedged around with as many safeguards as we can possibly secure, because the Executive is then, on its own admission, thereby removing the opportunity of the citizen to have access to the courts. That is a power which the Executive should get only with greatâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be made clear that we are not refusing access to the courts. We are merely saying that they do not come within the provisions of this scheme. The courts are always available to all people, whether they are inside or outside the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the whole essence of this Bill is that, by virtue of poverty, certain classes of the citizens are not having access to the courts. This Bill is introduced to remedy that. It is true that the right of access to the courts remains. As a learned judge once said, This is a free country. Any tramp in the street can dine in the Ritz and any millionaire can sleep out under the arches if he wants to, although they do not in practice do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill is intended to remove a financial disability which prevented citizens from having access to the courts, and when the Executive seeks either to give or to withhold such aid it should be hedged around with every possible safeguard. We agree that the Lord Advocate has courteously and fully explained the position of the Executive. We do

	<span class='label label-info column'>1983</span>
not wish to overstress the matter, but we have further points in relation to this which we should wish to press. In the circumstances, I think that my hon. Friends would not wish to press this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to say a few words to the Lord Advocate, to thank him for making clear what the Opposition had made obscure by this Amendment. I was completely bewildered in trying to understand this Amendment and what it was getting at. After the second explanation of the Lord Advocate the supporters of the Amendment themselves began to see the light, and as a consequence of a hurried discussion they have now made up their minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were about to seek leave to withdraw the Amendment, but of course if this sort of thing goes on we shall certainly not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the Leader of the Opposition to make up his own mind whether or not he will withdraw the Amendment.

When the Opposition make up their minds to put down Amendments, and then come forward with the specious plea that they do so on behalf of the Scottish people, and because of the Scottish people's love of knowing exactly where they stand with regard to the law, they should ensure that they put down an Amendment which lis an Amendment, which is something to make the Bill better, and not merely something which will make the Bill more obscure to the Scottish people and to the Scottish Grand Committee, so that it takes the Lord</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purport of this Amendment is to ensure that no action in regard to the making of regulations shall be taken by the Executive authorityâ€”that is by the Secretary of Stateâ€”without due consultation with the accredited representatives of the legal profession, and without the approval of the head of the judiciary system in Scotland. It will be within the recollection of the Committee that a good deal of the feeling shown over this Bill during Second Reading was due to the fear by many hon. Members, particularly on this side, that there would be some interference by the Executive with the conduct and workings of our legal and judicial institutions. This Amendment is designed to ensure that any action which may be taken by the Secretary of State in regard to the making of regulations must carry with it the concurrence of the judiciary as well as the ultimate approval of Parliament.

The success of this Bill and the preservation of our traditional standards of justice are two things which, I feel sure, we all desire to see. I suggest that the success of the Bill can be achieved only
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1987</span>
by the wholehearted co-operation in its operation by the members of the legal profession, and that the maintenance of proper standards of justice can be achieved only by refusing to allow the Executive to interfere with any matters of a judicial nature. We feel that this is a very reasonable Amendment indeed, and that it is a very great safeguard for the people and the law system of our country. I hope the Government will see their way to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as I can see, this is a somewhat peculiar Amendment to come from the Opposition. It would appear that Parliament can do nothing in the matter without the concurrence of the Lord President. I know the legal profession is a pretty tight union. I do not know of any trade union that has had conferred upon it the right to say what Parliament shall do and when Parliament shall do it. I do not mind consultation with the legal profession. That is probably absolutely necessary. Why, however, go on to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"and with the concurrence of the Lord President"?</p></blockquote>
I take it that this means the Lord President of the Court of Session. I want to be clear on that point. It could mean the Lord President of the Council. I agree that he may be there in perpetuity, but this Amendment means that if the Lord President does not give his concurrence in what may be the outcome of discussions between the Law Society and the Law Officers of the Crown, nothing can be done. Am I correct in that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is what it says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we may as well settle this point now. It may save trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The powers of Parliament will remain supreme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not if we deprive Parliament of the power to make regulations. I want to know whether, after consultation with the Law Society, the regulations cannot be made because the Lord President has not given his concurrence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1988</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Member realises that this is a regulation-making power which we are attempting to hedge with safeguards. The supremacy of Parliament remains as always to pass an Act of Parliament. This Clause says what should be done by regulation. The supremacy of Parliament remains absolutely untouched. What we would limit is the intervention of the Executive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems as though the right hon. and gallant Gentleman is proposing to achieve by this Amendment what he failed to achieve on the previous Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. That would be a most unsatisfactory way of going on, and the Chairman would have ruled this Amendment out of Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last Amendment was to the effect that Parliament should pass an Act of Parliament. I understand that the Opposition say that there is a safeguard because the Government of the day can introduce an Act of Parliament. I am trying to understand this. Surely it is a simple question. If the Lord President does not concur, the only alternative left to the Government is to introduce an Act of Parliament to give effect to their desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government wish to overrule the Law Society and the Lord President, they should come before Parliament.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to appear so stubborn about it. Do I take it that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman is suggesting that this extraordinary power should be placed in the hands of the Law Society with the concurrence of the Lord President, to determine whether a thing can be carried through by a regulation or by a new Act of Parliament? Let us assume that the Law Society and the Government agree and that the Lord President does not agree in what they have agreed. Where are we? Do I take it that the Lord President can be more powerful even than the Law Society in conjunction with the Law Officers of the Crown?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

questions. Does the hon. Member suggest that the overruling of the Lord President of the Court of Session, the trustee of the legal rights of the Scottish people, should be done by a regulation of the Executive? The more the hon. Member advances his arguments, the more dangerous his arguments appear. We say that it certainly should not be done without an Act of Parliament. The suggestion that the Executive should be entrusted with greater and greater power over the justiciaryâ€”for that is what the hon. Member is arguingâ€”seems to us most dangerous. That it should be done by a passing of a resolution through either House of Parliament does not relieve our anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understood the right hon. and gallant Gentleman correctly, this is not a question of interfering with the justiciary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee can come to its own conclusion. The Opposition are stating that the Lord President of the Court of Session is more powerful than Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1990</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have asked several questions to which I have not yet received answers. I want hon. Members of this Committee to observe that if there is any sense in the argument put forward by the Opposition it means that the Lord President, an individual, is all-powerful. My submission is that Parliament, which lays down the law, has the right, either by regulation or legislation, to abrogate the law any time it likes, irrespective of what the Lord President or any other body may think about it. This new power contained in the Amendment is one that I do not think the Committee will sanction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before this Debate develops any further the Committee may wish to have the views of the Government on this matter. That may or may not shorten the Debate: that is always debatable in Committee. Let me say at the outset that I agree substantially with the interpretation put on this Amendment by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire (Mr. McKinlay). It will be seen quite clearly that there are certain stipulations laid down before regulations under subsection (3) can be made. One of the stipulations certainly is that regulations shall not come into force unless or until approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment would seek to impose two other conditions: one, that there should be consultation with the Law Society, and two, that there should be the concurrence of the Lord President of the Court of Session. It means that any regulation would require to have a preamble setting out that it proceeded with the concurrence of the Lord President. If that condition were not fulfilled the regulation would be 	<i>ultra vires</i>. I understood from the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for West Edinburgh (Lieut.-Commander Hutchison) that he wanted to have this power of veto, for that is what it amounts to, in a way. If the Lord President can say, in his discretion, "I do not agree with the regulation proposed and, therefore, I cannot give it my 	<i>imprimatur,"</i> it will not go forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the merits of that point. Let me point out that the reason why we cannot accept this suggestion of the concurence of the Lord President is simply this, that these are regulations which are subject to Parliamentary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1991</span>
Procedure, and I take the constitutional view that no person should have the right to veto regulations which are subject to Parliamentary approval who himself is not subject to Parliamentary approval. A person who has that power should be in a position to go on to the Floor of the Houseâ€”of either Houseâ€”and defend his attitude for exercising that right of veto. Unfortunately, the Lord President is not in that position. Therefore, for constitutional reasons, I do not think we can accept the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great deal of misconception about this Clause. I am sure that hon. Members opposite do not mean to misconceive it. Certain phrases have been used: "interfering with the proceedings of the justiciary," "the preservation of proper standards of justice," "the Lord President is the trustee of the rights of the Scottish people." I always thought that Parliament was the principal trustee of the rights of the Scottish people. I concede that the courts are also trustees. I agree entirely, but I think Parliament is the primary trustee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us find out what exactly these regulations are. They are not interfering or proposing to interfere in any way in the courts of justice in the administration of justice. They say legal aid will apply to certain courts or will not apply to certain courts. That it will be available to certain kinds of proceedings or not available to certain kinds of proceedings. They do not interfere with the administration of justice or with those called upon to administer justice. Therefore, there is no invasion of the rights of the justiciary or the rights of the litigants, so far as the administration of justice is concerned. This is merely a stipulation that legal aid will be available in some cases and not in others. That is what the regulations seek to do. I know that hon. Gentlemen opposite would not like the Debate to go along the wrong channels, and, therefore, I do not think we should develop this question of whether or not these regulations are in any way interfering with proceedings of a judicial nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the first part of the Amendment, the consultation with the Law Society, hon. Members will recollect that the White Paper, which more or less en-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1992</span>
visaged the scheme which the Law Society will set up or may set up under this Bill when it becomes an Act, provided for a central supervisory committee. In consultation with the legal bodies, we have made it quite clear that this central supervisory committee will also be an advisory committee to the Secretary of State. There is no need for duplicating these matters. When we remember that under Clause 7 the Law Society is charged with this duty, and we know that the Law Society envisages setting up the central advisory committee which will have among its other functions the functions of an advisory nature, then it will be seen that there is no need to clutter up the Bill with this unnecessary provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before any extension or contraction of the scheme takes place by way of regulations of this nature, the central advisory committee will obviously be consulted. That is inherent in the whole of the scheme. For that reason, it is unnecessary to say that we shall always consult with the court and the head of the court, the Lord President, in matters of this nature. I do not think it is necessary to put consultation into the Bill, because it is inherent in the whole structure of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFarlane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to take part in this discussion because I have had no legal experience, but I have read the reports, and both the reports have impressed upon me the fact that the judicial system must be independent of the Executive. So far as this Amendment is concerned, the desire is to insure independence of our legal system from the Executive. I know that the Lord Advocate deprecates consultation with the Law Society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from deprecating consultation, I have just given an assurance that consultation will be the normal procedure. It is only because this Amendment is unnecessary that I am resisting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFarlane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Lord Advocate. He prefers to rely on the consultative committee rather than upon the Law Society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultative committee is set up by the Law Society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFarlane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a long record of legal aid in Scotland, which is borne
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1993</span>
out by these two reports. Our system has been administered independent of the Executive, and therefore I think it is justifiable that the Lord President should have some standing in this matter. We have been told that so far as the machinery is concerned it will be dealt with by regulations which will not in any way interfere with the principles of justice. I agree with that, but the Committee will notice that both tribunals and courts are mentioned in the Bill. We have had recent experience of the advancement of this conception of tribunals. I am referring to legislation in connection with landlords and tenants, which is based on no other consideration than the use of the word "reasonable." I know that I have the support of the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire (Mr. McKinlay) in this, because during the passage of that Bill he denounced in a most forthright manner legislation being based on the word "reasonable."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot, of course, see into the future, but we can anticipate a large extension of this conception of tribunals that has such an attraction to Members opposite. Therefore, the question of right of access to these courts in the future will be of very great importance, and it is all the more essential that our system of justice should be independent as far as possible of the Executive. For that reason, I urge that this Amendment should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had great difficulty in following the argument of the hon. Member for Camlachie (Mr. McFarlane). If I understood his argument aright, I cannot see how it can possibly apply to this Amendment. The hon. Member put his finger on the spot, however, when he pointed out that this Amendment would mean sharing the power of the Executive with the Law Society and the Lord President. I do not see why the Opposition should be asking for that. I quite understand there being a right of appeal to the Lord President on some particular point of law, but I do not see why those who are to make the regulations should have to have the concurrence of the Lord President. Obviously there is something wrong if regulations cannot be laid before Parliament until consent has first been obtained from the Lord President and there has been consultation with the Law Society.

Whenever I find something I do not understand, I am not afraid to say that I do not know. I have not yet met a man who knew everything, except the right hon. and gallant Gentleman. He may be the last word in knowledge, the Scottish oracle that can be consulted on everything, and if that claim is made on behalf of the right hon. and gallant Gentleman he is welcome to it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may interest the Committee to know that if I paraded all the subjects I do know something about, some of our learned Friends would appear to be a lot of also-rans. As I said, I am not afraid to admit my ignorance on a subject. I always behave in a tolerant way in any company, even in the company of people who have not the ordinary command over their tempers but have to get up and show a childish and petty display of temper merely because they do not agree with something.

In subsection (4), it is provided that:

I am anxious to know what courts there are of that type in Scotland. With regard to the Amendment, I have no doubt that it will be turned down. As a matter of fact, it smacks of Fascism. I have no

	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Gomme-Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your Ruling, Mr. Mathers. We wish to avoid anything that savours of Nazism or totalitarianism. It is rather unfortunate if we should have anything which shows a sign of totalitarianism at all. Therefore the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather afraid of speaking at a meeting of this Committee. Although my name might suggest that I am a Scotsman, I am not. At the same time this is an Amendment which is worthy of some comment. Otherwise it ought not to be here. The legal fraternity are backing this particular Amendment because it is something out of the common. They cannot trust Parliament to deal with a particular matter of this character. I do not think that the Amendment is necessary to this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1996</span>
This Amendment must have emanated from the idea that Parliament is not able to deal with this subject of legal aid. It should be noted, however, that Parliament has some ability and intelligence. I always assumed that Parliament had available a tremendous amount of legal ability. If the Amendment is put forward with the idea that the Law Society, by its experience and long connection, knows more of this subject than Parliament and that it should be consulted, it must spring from the idea that Parliament itself is not sufficiently able to deal with the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not had a great experience of Parliament, but I am convinced from what little experience I have had that in a matter of this kind, which is not so technical, Parliament has sufficient ability and authority to cope with the problem after full Debate and consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment in reality is an attempt to place on the Statute Book the idea that the Law Society stands aloof and has greater ability for considering a matter of this kind than Parliament. Therefore, they want to make it an obligation that before Parliament deals with this particular question, which is not of very great technical complexity, the Law Society must of necessity be consulted. The whole thing seems to me to be ridiculous and absolutely unnecessary. I am surprised that it is on the Order Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. N. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While welcoming the intervention of the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. McKay), I am not quite certain that I agree that this is not a highly technical matter. It seems to me that it is. In dealing with the previous Amendment the Lord Advocate was talking of the overloading of the system, and saying that the effect of subsection (3) is either going to be an increase in, or a reduction of, the load.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is going to do more than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I read it, that is the principal function of the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it will do much more than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal with that aspect of it first?. The first suggestion is that there should be consultation with the Law Society. As this Measure is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1997</span>
going to have a great effect on the legal profession and as the success of any regulations that may be introduced will depend on the results they have on the legal profession, it is quite clear that that profession should be consulted. The Lord Advocate agrees with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not myself be prepared to say it, but I should accept from the Lord Advocate whether the words "central advisory committee" would be necessary if we wished to ensure that the Law Society should be consulted in the appropriate way. It may be that the first part of the Amendment could stand, and that the Lord Advocate would be prepared to accept it, namely,
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be made except in consultation with the Law Society."</p></blockquote>
It may be he would wish to add
	<br><blockquote><p>"the central advisory committee of the Law Society."</p></blockquote>
The Lord Advocate has indicated that he proposes to do that anyway. My point is that if he proposes to do it a matter of such great importance should be in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We go on to the second part, which is plainly much more contentious and reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"and with the concurrence of the Lord President."</p></blockquote>
The Lord President is head of the legal profession and he has a very special responsibility in regard to it. There are certain difficulties in the insertion of the words. It may be that the Lord President is not available, but in that event the term "the Lord President" might include "the acting-Lord President." It may be that the Lord President might not be prepared to act at all, but it certainly is extremely far-fetched that on a matter which quite clearly concerns the whole of the legal profession he should refuse to act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that he would express an adverse opinion. The point of view of this side of the Committee is that we have taken account of the capacity of the machine which is to operate. In this case it is the legal profession and it is that profession which is best able to state whether the load can be added to or reduced. The Lord President, being the head of the legal profession, has a special responsibility and position in this regard. If the Lord President does not concur then, of course, he can be overruled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If that is the case, then it means that regulations can be made without the concurrence of the Lord President. We all know that a discussion on an affirmative resolution starts late at night and the Closure is applied after one and a half hours or may be a couple of hours' Debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Is is in Order for any Member to make a suggestion that Parliament itself is not an instrument which is satisfactory for dealing with a resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no point of Order in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made the point sufficiently clear. If the Lord President does not agree, then it is the view of this side of the Committee that a Bill should be introduced to give the fullest protection to the rights that in this Bill are being given to the citizen. We have to keep in mind that for some reason or another, such as the expense or because the machine was being overloaded, legal aid might be reduced by the removal of certain cases from the first part of the First Schedule to be placed in the second part. We think that that should only be done with the concurrence of the Lord President, but if the Lord President does not concur then the fullest discussion should be given to the regulation by Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member said something about the expense of the litigation. What has the Lord President to do with the financing of this Bill for legal aid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Lord President has not necessarily any function with regard to the expense. That was one of the cases I was citing as a reason why there might be a removal from one part of the Schedule to the other. It is quite obvious that the opinion of the Lord President would be extremely valuable on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter of opinion but a matter of the veto of the Lord President.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1999</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a veto on what can be done or cannot be done by Parliament. It is a veto on what the Executive can do and it is the Executive which makes the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intervene again, but we must get this thing absolutely correct. The regulations are made by Parliament under the affirmative resolution procedure, but they can never come before Parliament under this Amendment if the Lord President refuses to give his concurrence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macpherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the Lord Advocate says but the word "made" is very wide. When I said that the Executive made the regulations I meant that it drafts and presents them to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I submit that this Amendment is completely unnecessary and confusing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is vicious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Lord Advocate stated what is in his experience the general practice when regulations are being made by the Government, and that is to have consultation with the relevant interests. Where regulations such as these are made the Law Society and the heads of the relevant sections of the legal profession as well as other interests would be taken into consideration. I say that this is confusing because the power to make regulations is set out perfectly clearly in Clause 11, where it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may make such regulations as appear to him necessary or desirable for giving effect to this Part of this Act or for preventing abuses thereof."</p></blockquote>
The Clause sets out the scope of the regulations which may be made and what they may do. This Amendment proposes to introduce a new element, namely to provide a veto on the making of the regulations. It is unnecessary and would be a clog on the working of the Act and the making of regulations. I hope the Opposition will withdraw the Amendment, because it is redundant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Lord Advocate made a very clear and easily understood explanation of the situation and of the undesirability of the Amendment, but towards the conclusion of his remarks he said something which seemed ambiguous.
	<span class='label label-info column'>2000</span>
He said that the Law Society will appoint a special committee which will be consulted by and will advise the Secretary of State. That is all that is necessary. Hon. Members should be satisfied that with a special committee representing the Law Society and advising the Secretary of State this matter will be properly dealt with. The Lord Advocate said that the Lord President does not enter into this because the administration of justice is not affected in any way in relation to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, after making that absolutely clear, the Lord Advocate said that the Lord President would be consulted. Did he mean that? If he did, what is the sense of it? Why should the Lord President be consulted? If he is consulted and he says that he is opposed to a certain regulation, what are we to do? Do we say: "I am very sorry to hear it, but we are not interested in whether you agree or disagree?" Up to that point, what was laid down by the Lord Advocate was the correct course to be followed in this matter. I would like him to make clear whether he was serious about the suggestion that the Lord President of the Court of Session need be consulted, and what is to happen if he has to be consulted and does not agree with what is proposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Debate bears out what I suggested at the beginning of our discussion, the great touchiness of the Scottish people on anything to do with law. That touchiness is not confined to one side or other of the Committee. It led to a remarkable 	<i>obiter dictum</i> by the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire (Mr. McKinlay) that Parliament appoints the judges. I take it that the Lord Advocate does not concur with that, but it would be as well to get it straight. I am sure we can appeal to the Lord Advocate as to who does appoint the judges, and that it is not Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the same time, may we be told who removes them and who executed the judges in days long ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Lord Advocate might desire to be saved from friends. I will not bully the Government or its supporters by dragging up and down the Floor of the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2001</span>
the somewhat remarkable line of argument to which the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire has just directed our attention. If anything could justify the uneasiness felt in some quarters about the Bill, it is the line of argument and, still more, the line of interruption pursued by the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member for Kelvingroveâ€”[	<i>Laughter</i>.] I apologise to Kelvingrove. The hon. and gallant Member for the Scottish Universities is trying to do what he has done before. If I may say so without offence, he is resorting to an old debating trick by using as much skill as he can to prevent a simple answer being given to a simple question. This question of the judges can be discussed at a later stage, but I would like to know who it was who recently sent away someone from the Front Bench to another place. May we have an answer about the absolute veto powers conferred on the Lord President by the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>â€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no. Not the right hon. and gallant Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman's speech was entirely addressed to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKinlay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the hon. and gallant Member for West Edinburgh (Lieut.-Commander Hutchison) from whom I want a reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both of us are capable of giving a reply, and we are anxious to meet the convenience of the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire. I rose in order to do that. I was merely indicating that it was desirable to clear up the suggestion by the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire that Parliament appoints the judges. I take it that the Committee are now solidly of the opinion that that is not so, and that the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire was advancing what one might call a very unconstitutional doctrine in his suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is whether the concurrence of the Lord President should be obtained as well as having consultation with the legal profession. The Lord Advocate has courteously indicated that the consultation point is met by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2002</span>
existence of the advisory committee, the child of the Law Society, which will be consulted in all cases. I think that deals with the point raised by the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. McKay) who did not see the necessity for this. The Lord Advocate not only sees the necessity for it but sets up a special body for the purpose. Not only has the special position of the legal profession been put forward by the Opposition but it has been recognised and emphasised by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is already in the Bill. Therefore why did the hon. and gallant Gentleman put it in his Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dealing with the point about consultation. We thought it would be better if it were specifically stated. The Lord Advocate has indicated that in his opinion the body which is being set up fully meets that point. That is a matter of opinion, but we were both at one upon the necessity for consultation with the legal profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the point of real substance on which the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire specifically asked for an answer. It was the point as to the word "concurrence." There we are at sharp odds with the Lord Advocate who indicates that in his view this would make the Amendment entirely unacceptable. I see the difficulties which he brings forward, but we consider that to act in matters such as this by regulation is inadvisable. As we have said before, working by regulation should be hedged about by safeguards. This is one of the safeguards which we suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We concede that flexibility should be of the utmost importance and that we should not have a hold up owing to some mere formality, but we say that if the concurrence of the Lord President can be secured the matter is a suitable one to be dealt with by regulations. It is not a question of veto, but of whether the matter is suitable for proceeding by regulation or by an amending Act, that is, among other things, by bringing it specifically to the notice of the Scottish Grand Committee where it may be properly thrashed out. If the concurrence of the Lord President can be assured, we wish the matter to be dealt with under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2003</span>
more extended procedure which would bring the Scottish Grand Committee into play as has happened this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was without the concurrence of the Lord President.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any Act of Parliament is not only discussed but also decided without the concurrence of the Lord President. The hon. Member merely reiterates what we have said and hon. Members opposite have denied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should not regulations be also?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to fall into loggerheads with the hon. Member for West Renfrew.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scollan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and gallant Gentleman got the worst of it last time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the hon. Member thinks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and gallant Gentleman says that this is not a veto. His Amendment says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Shall not be made except in consultation with the Law Society and with the concurrence of the Lord President."</p></blockquote>
Surely that is an explicit veto on the making of the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The argument which we are bringing forward is that regulations are suitable for minor matters and for the purposes of flexibility and that an Act of Parliament is suitable for grave matters which concern the citizens. We say that the Lord President of Court of Session is a suitable person to bring in, not on the question of veto or non-veto but on the question whether the matter is suitable to be dealt with by regulation. The Lord Advocate demurs from that and there is a sharp division of opinion between the two sides. We cannot reach any final decision by argument and we are therefore willing to seek a decision by a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
