	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Woodburn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That after its rising on Tuesday, 12th July, the Committee do sit again to consider the Scottish Estimates on Wednesday, 13th July, and Tuesday, 19th July, at half-past Ten o'clock."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we arrive at a decision on this matter, could we be informed when we are taking the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill and the Housing (Scotland) Bill through Report stage and Third Reading? It appears to me that we are trying to concertina all our work into a very short period, and I wonder whether, before we come to a decision, the right hon. Gentleman could give us any idea when we are likely to take these Measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has not been intimated yet. There is a possibility that it might be on Wednesday next week, and I should hope so, but naturally the problem is whether we can do all this work. We are bound to finish the Supply Days before the end of the Session, but that is a matter for adjustment, and if that can be adjusted next week I dare say the Committee might alter its decision today. It is better that we should make a preliminary decision today, and that the other matters should be discussed through the usual channels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some considerable doubt whether this Committee can do justice to the work which it has to do if it has to sit at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday and continue until perhaps 10 p.m. practically without a break. This seems to me to be piling it on a little too much, and if some adjustment can be made it will be to the benefit of the Committee and Scotland as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I say that Ministers have no love for long hours? Members are already working long hours
	<span class='label label-info column'>2954</span>
on Committees every morning and in the House in the afternoon, and I hardly think that the Scottish Grand Committee can claim any absolution from that work, which has got to go on. It is a matter for the Opposition whether they wish to take their Supply Days, and we are not pressing them in any way to do that; but the work of the House really must go on, and it is better from the point of view of progress with the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, and in order that the Opposition and other hon. Members might have plenty of time to consider any Amendments, that the Second Reading should be completed before the Adjournment. I think that would be for the convenience of the House, but that is not exactly our business. The question for this Committee is in the hands of the Opposition themselves. It is their choice and their decision whether they take their Supply Days, but I think that from the point of view of the progress of the Committee the Motion I have moved is the proper one this morning. I think the other matters can be discussed later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is unfortunate that the Secretary of State twitted us about not wanting to use our Supply Days, because we shall certainly need them. The point I am anxious about is that Scottish Members have to work very hard in the mornings and we still have to consider the extremely important questions of Scottish housing and criminal justice in Scotland, which might well demand a whole day to itself. If it is suggested that all this work should be telescoped with the Report stage and Third Reading of the Housing (Scotland) Bill, I think the Secretary of State should represent to his colleagues it is scarcely fair that Scottish business should be so cramped and compressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been informed—I was not there myself—that certain Scottish Members have imposed on themselves certain restraints in regard to the length of their speeches; they have suggested that we might revert to the older method by which Scottish Members limited their contributions and compressed their points without going into so much detailed explanation, with a view to accelerating the progress of business and allowing more Members to take part in the discussions. If that were also extended to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) and Housing (Scotland) Bils, I am quite

	<p>10.36 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to limit my remarks to the shortest possible space of time, and that task will be easier because I was able, through the courtesy of the Committee, to give a more extended survey of the matter when we considered this subject a year ago. I then drew attention to the disquieting fact, which had been apparent for at least 12 months before then, that
	<span class='label label-info column'>2956</span>
the great social curve of pulmonary tuberculosis, which is the index figure that is recognised in all countries not merely as an index to tuberculosis but to the general state of the progress of the country for which the curve is drawn, had been turning against us in Scotland. That was a very disquieting thing, and last year the Committee were impressed by that fact and the Secretary of State said he was so impressed by it that he was appointing a committee to go into the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point I would like to make is that we have not yet had any report from this Committee which was set up 12 months ago, and I suggest that factual considerations, at any rate, might well have been available for Scottish Members and particularly for this discussion, in view of the fact that many valuable facts have already been ascertained. Through the courtesy of the Scottish Department of Health, over which the right hon. Gentleman presides, I was able, for the purposes of an address which I was recently giving, to obtain certain facts set out in graphic form, and I have here one of these graphs which I will show to the Committee, which I am sure will be of great interest. In many of these matters statistics are difficult to follow, but a curve standing out and making quite clear what is the bearing and implication of those statistics brings conviction home to all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating this subject under difficulties, because the factual inquiry which was set on foot by the Secretary of State as a result of these figures being brought to his notice has not yet given any indication of the nature of its report or when that report will be available. I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman when he expects the report will be available. Will it be available, for instance, before the House rises for the Summer? Could the Secretary of State give us any information on that matter now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure it will not be. I make that statement quite definitely. As the right hon. and gallant Gentleman says, a great many facts have been elucidated, but, as they exist at present, if they were to be published, they would be very misleading and in some cases alarming to certain sections,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2957</span>
without necessarily being conducive. Therefore, we would be very reluctant to publish any such figures unless we were certain that they would not create a wrong impression on those affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be most unwilling to have anything published which might be misleading or alarming to the Scottish people, but I would point out to the Secretary of State and the Committee that these things are being published now and that alarm is being spread. It may well be that they are exaggerated figures, but, in the absence of authoritative and accurate figures, the exaggerated figures hold the field to themselves. At the recent medical conference at Harrogate, figures of an alarming nature were certainly quoted and comments of an alarming nature were certainly made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not deprecating the publication of general figures, but the point is that as a result of stimulating these researches last year a great deal of breaking down of the figures has taken place. It is obvious that if some of these figures which have been broken down were to be published it might result in exaggerating the alarm felt among a section of the people, and we are very anxious, before coming to any conclusion or giving any figures which might cause a wrong conclusion to be reached, that the matter should be thoroughly examined and proper statistics obtained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every sympathy with that, as I am sure every hon. Member has, but I would reiterate that at the present time the only authoritative figures or comment available to Scottish people are those of a year ago, and it was thought that for the purposes of this Debate there would be some authoritative figures or comments available in the Report. I should have thought that it would have been desirable that certain of these facts or figures might have been provided even in the form of a White Paper, because I think anxious comment will continue in Scotland so long as the situation remains obscure and is, in fact, deteriorating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Secretary of State, if the inquiry which he has undertaken is so widespread and authoritative, whether he will consider a comparison between
	<span class='label label-info column'>2958</span>
the figures for Scotland and those of England, because the figures for Scotland cannot be adequately considered merely in relation to Scotland itself. The figures for England, and particularly those for the north of England, have a bearing on the matter, and it is impossible to conceive that the figures for Newcastle differ very much from those of Galashiels or those of Carlisle from Dumfries, while the figures for England as a whole may differ very widely from the figures for Scotland as a whole. Only by such methods can we arrive at a really satisfactory result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, while admitting the desire of the Secretary of State not to publish misleading conclusions, I should have hoped that it might be possible to bring out at least an interim report, and, that he might consider, if it is going to be at such length, whether the Medical Research Council might not also be brought in and some parallel figures elicited for England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave some figures to the Committee on the last occasion—the only figures which I was able to obtain as a layman and as a back bench Member. They seemed to indicate that what I called the slope to the north was evident in England as well as in Scotland; that the good tuberculosis figures are in the south of England and that as one moves to the north the figures slope upwards. That would give some reason why our figures in Scotland were so strikingly unsatisfactory. This is not conclusive, because when one goes far north, to Aberdeen, one comes to a point where the figures suddenly improve again. The Aberdeen Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Harry Rae, in his report for 1947, was able to point out that although in Scotland as a whole the death rate for pulmonary tuberculosis was 66, in Aberdeen it was 35. That is a very striking figure, and it seems to indicate that other factors besides the climate have something to do with the matter. In fact, he was able to say that no city of similar population in the United Kingdom had a lower rate. That is a very striking fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On looking at the statistics before us, the first thing I would say is that the pulmonary curve continues to run against us. It runs against us in the number of deaths and also in notifica-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2959</span>
tions. When we were discussing this a year ago, I asked the Committee to dismiss to some extent the notifications, at any rate as compared with pre-war years, because of the greater powers of diagnosis and the use of mass radiography and other things which might well falsify those figures. Post-war, however, taking one year with another, I think it is just to say that at any rate notifications were a very valuable forecast of what might be expected to happen. On the forecast of notifications, I said that one would expect this year that the pulmonary tuberculosis figures would again have increased. They have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For recapitulation purposes perhaps I may point out that in 1939 the number of deaths was, 2,717; in 1945, 2,932: in 1946, 3,231; in 1947, 3,739, and in 1948, 3,417. Notifications also have moved up. As I say, I shall not give the pre-war notifications, which were very much lower, because they might be slightly falsified by the greater care now being taken. For the post-war years, however, the figures of notifications were: in 1945, 7,317; in 1946, 7,627: in 1947, 7,984; and in 1948, 8,010—that is the highest figure in Scotland for 30 years. These figures are most disquieting. On the other hand, there is another set of figures which is improving—the figures for non-pulmonary tuberculosis. That begins to reflect the weight of the long campaign for cleaning up herds, the campaign against bovine tuberculosis, in which, of course, Scotland takes a leading position, for the herds in Scotland have a higher percentage of non-tuberculous cattle than in any other part of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was, in fact, a disappointment to me last year to have to point out to the Committee that our figures for non-pulmonary tuberculosis were not as good as they should be considering the high degree of tuberculosis-free cattle we had succeeded in reaching. This year our efforts have shown fruition; the figures for non-pulmonary tuberculosis have gone down. In 1945 they were 18, which was still higher than it had been pre-war; in 1946, 15; in 1947, 14 and in 1948 they go down with a run to nine. That is a very satisfactory figure, indeed, but it makes it all the more important, when we are considering the tuberculosis curve, that we should pay close attention to the curve of pulmonary tuberculosis, because
	<span class='label label-info column'>2960</span>
if we blend the two curves—pulmonary and non-pulmonary—it masks the really dangerous, sinister factor at present, which is the rise in the pulmonary tuberculosis curve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke for a moment on the courtesy of the Scottish Department of Health in making available certain graphs and statistics, and I think it might be of interest to the Committee if I showed them this sheet, which is the curve of pulmonary tuberculosis as it should have been and as it is. The black line is the pre-war figure. The interrupted line is the projection of that figure as it would have continued had the statistics gone as we had hoped. The dotted line is, to use modern jargon, the deviationist curve, which is alarming us all just now. I think it is very clear—more clear than hours of description—and it shows that something has happened in the tuberculosis picture of Scotland in the last few years. I do not wish to weary the Committee by trying to demonstrate this as if it were a lecture, but I thought that Members would like to see the graph, which is of course available if anyone wants to see it. I think that this is the sort of thing which, in an interim report, would give a graphic picture that would be of very great importance and interest to all of us in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to take too long, but I want first of all to say that the picture is one which is certainly accentuated by the absence of sufficient sanatorium accommodation. In Scotland the patients in institutions have gone up from 4,253 in 1945 to 4,462 in 1948, and the waiting list has gone up from 1,600 in 1945 to 2,500 today. Yet there are still in Scotland 572 beds standing ready in every respect, which because of lack of staff cannot be used. There are 572 empty beds and 2,572 people—active tuberculosis cases—waiting to get into those beds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under those circumstances we have inevitably, I think, a rise in the tuberculosis figures. I spoke of the Aberdeen 'position a little while ago, and it is interesting to note that Dr. Harry Rae attributes at least part of the favourable position of Aberdeen to the fact that there was an adequacy of beds for cases. I do not need to speak at length on the position in Glasgow, but at the recent Harrogate Conference Dr. Smith of Glasgow
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2961</span>
described the increase in tuberculosis as terrifying. He spoke of the large increase in the waiting list in Glasgow and drew attention to a dangerous figure—the increase in the percentage of children under 15 on the list of notified cases, which percentage was 9.3 in 1945 and last year was 18.4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the National Health Service, the tuberculosis arrangements are, of course, being reorganised. Glasgow used to have its own tuberculosis organisation. Now the responsibility moves towards the Glasgow Regional Board. The National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis observes that the regional hospital board should set up a permanent tuberculosis committee. I do not know to what extent that counsel has been carried out in Scotland, but it is certainly very desirable that close and continuous attention should be given to the matter. I certainly think that the difficulties with which we are faced demand a strong, concentrated effort, specifically directed against this increase in Scotland—this curve which I have just shown the Committee. There are certain matters such as the B.C.G. vaccine. It might be that a more extended use of that might be of advantage, and certainly it might be of protective advantage. It might stop the very great wastage of nurses in tuberculosis institutions which rises to a figure as high as 65 per cent. But isolation is and always must be one of the main weapons for dealing with this white scourge. It is an infectious disease and, in so far as it is left in contact with other cases, the infection will spread. In so far as the infective cases are segregated, the disease will tend to be arrested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly I should have thought that an 	<i>ad hoc</i> increase in the housing arrangements by which we could bring down the terrifying figures of the active cases which, in a city like Glasgow, are still on the waiting list for rehousing, might well be one of the earliest steps. The number of active cases of tuberculosis on the waiting list in Glasgow in 1945 was 437, and in 1948 was 593. I think the Secretary of State must regard this as a matter of urgency. People are dying in increasing numbers. Something is happening against us here. I consider that the reaction of the Government to this situation shows a lack of a sense of urgency which, I think, is greatly to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>2962</span>
deprecated and certainly ought not to be continued. Therefore, in some way or other an increase in the sanatorium accommodation, to the extent at least of bringing into play the 500 or 600 beds which are empty, should be attempted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe it is beyond the possibilities of vigorous campaigning by the Secretary of State to obtain an increase in the number of nurses for the sanatoria. After all, during the war we were able to staff 50,000 to 60,000 beds more than are staffed today, and this is a war situation. Secondly, we need an increase in housing particularly for the priority cases certified by the medical officer as actively infective and likely to cause the further spread of the disease; thirdly, the use of existing devices such as B.C.G. vaccine and others, and fourthly, intensive examination into the causes and particularly into the causes of the recent rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I threw out to the Committee the question whether some deficiency in nutrition was perhaps responsible—some postwar deficiency in nutrition. That may be or may not be the case; certainly the intake of calories per head is less than it was prewar. It may be the fact that the people in Glasgow were always worse housed, but they had more money to spend on food, and did spend more money on food. Now, because of the universal rationing, they cannot get any more food than anybody else. It may be they are exposed to the full rigours of our climate and our difficulties and cannot recoup themselves in the way in which they previously did. It may be that some strain of a more active micro-organism has been introduced. It may be—it is possible—that somehow or other a more active tubercle infection has reached our country. It is not entirely to be ruled out that, for instance, the great influx from the Continent, the great influx of the Poles, may have had something to do with that. At any rate, so far there is a great question mark which hangs over this position, and that question mark has not been answered, and until it has been answered I am sure that we in this Committee should continue to devote our utmost attention to it, and to press it upon the Administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.2 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee can agree that there can be no more important subject than this question of tuberculosis. Indeed, that is proved
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2963</span>
by the fact that because of the Debate that took place last year, which disclosed the tragic position that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman has outlined today, steps were taken that had never before been taken in Scotland to deal with this problem. The first thing that is important is not to create undue alarm or panic by any exaggeration of the position. I am not wanting in any way to lessen its importance, but I think that some statements that have been made in the Press, and, indeed, some of the right hon. and gallant Gentleman's conclusions today, may create the impression that things are even worse than they actually are. Let me deal with one matter straight away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and gallant Gentleman in his last few remarks made one of the conjectures we all make as to the causes of this position, and suggested that one cause might be the influx of the Poles. The facts I have show that the main increases have taken place in districts where the Poles have not been. For instance, my constituency was very susceptible to the invasion of the Poles—a great many of them stayed there a long time—but no increase in tubercular infection is traceable to them. Indeed, if there were any question of that, the danger would be greater on the West coast—and I have looked into this—because as the incidence of tuberculosis is very high in Southern Ireland as compared with that in our country, the number of cases in our country might have been increased by the influx of people coming from Southern Ireland. However, even that conjecture does not bear examination, because never in our history has there been a smaller importation from Southern Ireland than there has been in this period when the rise in tuberculosis has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention that to show that when we come to the questions arising in the mind of the right hon. and gallant Gentleman and in my mind—and the right hon. and gallant Gentleman is an expert in this matter, and had to deal with the problem in his time—we find that at the time when he was in office the problem appeared as though it were being overcome, and so there was not the same impulse to ask questions. Therefore, I would say, without any chance of contradiction, that no Secretary of State has asked more ques-
	<span class='label label-info column'>2964</span>
tions about this than the present Secretary of State since the discussion we had last year. The results of my questions have been rather interesting, and I shall come to them in a moment. But as the right hon. and gallant Gentleman said, one of the interesting things is how one can be misled by figures. As he said, if we examine the total figures we find that the total death rate has decreased from 80 to 75, but we find that the decrease has taken place because of the decrease in non-pulmonary tuberculosis. But here also a great deal of misapprehension can arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also been inquiring into the question of the decrease in non-pulmonary tuberculosis. I was always under the impression that it was a fairly true generalisation, that most non-pulmonary tuberculosis was due to bovine infection. Now I find that that applies only to certain types of non-pulmonary tuberculosis. Therefore, the field is narrowed even further. A further breaking up of figures and causes has to take place. The drop in non-pulmonary tuberculosis deaths is from 705 to 426. When we come to the notifications generally—and we are keeping to notifications for tuberculosis—we find, as the right hon. and gallant Gentleman suggested, they have gone up. They have gone up by a third between 1935 and 1939. That is, a third more cases are being notified now in Scotland than were being notified in the five years just prior to the war. Here we come to the fact that the methods of notification have changed, for mass radiography has been introduced with a view to stopping tuberculosis at the early stage of the infection, and notifications are made to that end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, a comparison between notifications today and notifications pre-war has absolutely no value unless to show that the medical profession is more able and much more alert to deal with the incipient disease. So we should take encouragement from the mass of notifications, because the earlier notification takes place the more certain is the cure. I think we ought to make it clear that this disease is not an incurable disease, and that thousands of cases have been cured. Indeed, I know of several cases amongst my own acquaintance, of people who have lived long years and are still alive, though it was 30 years since they were treated for the disease, and treated for it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2965</span>
even by the treatment of that time. The mass notifications and the number of notifications give no indication as to the reason for the increase in deaths, and, therefore, the increase in deaths is the factor that is worrying us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to get more facts, and trying to get nearer to the kernel of the problem, and the committee I set up has been going into this matter for a whole year. However, instead of its investigation making the matter simpler, its investigations have revealed the complexity of the problem and how difficult it is to reach any very sound conclusions. For example, the deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis have been rising in Scotland, but the curious thing is that they have not been rising in every case, and I am glad to be able to tell the right hon. and gallant Gentleman that the picture he gave of the children under 15 is not quite accurate, and that actually the number of cases has been going down slightly; it has come down even as compared with the pre-war figures, and it has been coming down since the war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So now we have a situation in which the number of cases amongst younger people has been coming down while the number of cases among some of the other people has been going up. However, I think that that makes the other figure more alarming. When we split these figures into sections we come to a situation which cannot be explained by any knowledge at the present time. Because of that, I think it would be most unwise to publish figures which would give rise to a great deal of speculation which might cause alarm and create hopelessness amongst certain groups. We should not be justified in publishing such figures until we have more facts and can give them with more certainty of correctitude and with greater particularity. Let us take something on which we can come to a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking Scotland as a whole, we can see that in the worst places the incidence is 110 per 100,000 people and that in the best places it is a little over 10 per 100,000. That is a tremendous variation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The green ones are counties and the black ones burghs. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>2966</span>
start with burghs like Paisley, Rutherglen, and Dundee, which are congested areas, and where there is a great deal of congestion. It has been the assumption for many years that congested living conditions spread tuberculosis, and I think that these figures indicate a 	<i>prima facie</i> case for that assumption, and that congestion of living conditions has still a great deal to do with the spread of the disease. Therefore, we came to the conclusion, which can at least do no harm and probably can do a great deal of good, that we should concentrate on segregation. If people can be segregated in their own homes, where it is done with the greatest care, a great deal of good can be done. Certainly, people in their own homes will get the most loving nursing that they can get anywhere. The only danger is that they do not obey the rules. I know of people who obeyed the rules scrupulously in their homes and lived, and I equally well know of people who did not obey the rules in their own homes and did not live. A great many people can save themselves by observing the rules laid down by the medical profession in this regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that last year we came to the preliminary conclusion that something ought to be done in regard to housing. I would say that the picture I have presented of the situation in the congested areas as compared with that in counties like Peebles, which has plenty of spaciousness, shows that so far as any distinction can be drawn it may be drawn as between congested old towns and country areas. On the other hand, Ross and Cromarty, which is a very widespread area, has a very bad situation. Therefore even that conclusion may not be an accurate conclusion, although on the whole it is true in a rough and ready way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has broken down the figures into congested and non-congested areas.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already explained that I could break them down to a lot of factors, but that might produce results which might mislead people. Therefore, for that reason, I suggested to the committee that we should not produce figures until we are satisfied that they give a more reasonable and probably more correct conclusion to the people who read them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since this matter has been raised, I may revert to the figure that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman quoted. It was quoted in the Press that there was a tuberculosis epidemic raging in this country, and especially in Scotland. I deplore that medical people should make wild statements of that kind. The situation is deteriorating, but to talk of it as an epidemic is alarming and quite nonsensical. He said that in 1938 the new cases of tuberculosis in Glasgow clinics numbered 3,300. My information is that in 1938 the number was 2,248. I do not know where these figures came from. He goes on to say that last year the figure was 9,981. According to my figures there were 3,148 in the Glasgow clinics. He states that in the first 21 weeks of this year the total was 5,248, but, so far as the Glasgow clinics are concerned, I understand the figure to be 1,382.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2968</span>
It shows how careful people have got to be in dealing with figures. Where those figures came from I do not know. [An HON. MEMBER: "Where is this from?"] I am quoting from the "News Chronicle" and the reports of a speech made by Dr. Smith, of Stonehouse. I do not know where he got his figures, but he may be referring to figures of a more comprehensive character. So far as we are concerned we have no knowledge of those statistics. Some terrifying figures are given of young people. In 1945 children under 15 made up 16.1 per cent. of notifications; in 1948 they made up 18.4 of notifications. Those are notifications and they have nothing to do with these other figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leonard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no use bandying about figures in the Press or elsewhere. An attempt should be made to get at the facts. Were any steps taken to ascertain where this doctor got his figures from, and were they checked up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report was published only a few days ago and there has not been time to correct it. I have only been able to find out now what the correct figures were. People should be very careful about creating alarm on this subject, because the more alarm that is created the more difficult it is to deal with the disease. People 'become terrified even of being examined in case they are found to have the disease. They become depressed and believe they have no hope. There is hope and the possibility of a cure, and therefore it must be dealt with carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, last year we came to a fairly sound conclusion that we ought to proceed on the basis of getting the people segregated if we could. First of all there was the question of houses. It could be done in people's own houses in some cases, and the clinic and dispensary services are helping very greatly in that regard. I took steps immediately to get an additional 1,000 aluminium houses, although the Government had stopped production on these. The kind of houses we needed were those which could be rushed off the production line, and we got these extra 1,000 houses despite the heavy cost and the desirability of shifting on to permanent houses. I am glad to say that 666 of these houses have already been accepted by the authorities and are in the process of being erected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2969</span>
I should like to make this point clear. I am not suggesting that aluminium houses were suitable for families where tuberculosis was present and that those families would get those houses. What it was intended to do was to make houses which were suitable available for tubercular families. If a five-roomed house were needed for a family suffering from tuberculosis, then an aluminium house could be given to a young couple as an alternative. As the Committee will remember, I took another step and brought this matter to the attention of my colleagues. We decided to take the further step of ordering some of the new Blackburn houses, which would use some of the unemployed bricklayers in their mass production. I am glad to say that the Blackburn houses are already in production, and the first have been delivered while others are coming on quite rapidly. This is bound to make a very considerable difference. Needless to say it will not show itself immediately in statistics, but it is an earnest of our attempt to tackle the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hospital beds are an additional way of segregating patients, and I am glad to say that we have been able to make an additional 500 beds available since the beginning of 1948. We have been able to put 50 more full-time nurses, which means a considerable number of beds, and 350 part-time nurses on to this work. That also will make some contribution to the treatment. These are mainly preventive measures, and we hope that they will have the effect of combating this problem. A number of other steps have been taken in regard to the treatment of patients, and the best thing is to get people treated as early as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacPherson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my right hon. Friend tell us something about treatment through streptomycin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. Treatment by streptomycin has been given a great deal of publicity. It is a valuable treatment in certain cases, but it is made ineffective and even dangerous in wrong cases. It would be very undesirable if people got it into their heads that here was a universal panacea and the only thing to do was to take streptomycin. Tuberculosis is not the kind of disease which affects people in the same way. It affects people in many different
	<span class='label label-info column'>2970</span>
ways, and the treatment must suit the disease. Streptomycin is available in all cases where suitable for use. I am sure that the Committee will be glad to have that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as B.C.G. is concerned, that is in the early stages. It will shortly be available for use in Scotland. At first it will be used in certain suitable groups so that it will be under clear supervision. It would be undesirable to have something not yet quite proved used in inexpert hands, and therefore B.C.G. will be used in connection with those cases where it is likely to be of value. It is not a universal vaccine like vaccination. It is going to be used for those people who are likely to come into contact. The matter will be treated as carefully as possible, but should not be a widespread vaccination at present. It has opened up a very interesting form of prevention which is being pursued, and it may be that this approach to the problem will lead to a greater solution. There are other treatments that have been going on for several years which are still successful in a large number of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general picture, therefore, is that it is true that Scotland is still going backwards in regard to tuberculosis. I am sorry to say that so far the figures this year show that that tendency has not been altered. The mystery is that we are not going backward in every case, and it is not easy to see why the cases which are not going back should be different from those which are. There is no explanation at all. I am a great believer in research, and in research being pushed to the uttermost. In the past the medical profession has concentrated on the cure. They are trying to find a cure for tuberculosis, and they have discovered a great deal, but we have been brought up against factors which were not known before, nor ever distinguished before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the problem is still mysterious for the moment it has been narrowed, and therefore in my view it has been made easier to get more information which will strengthen our struggle before we are engaged on further methods of attack. What we propose doing is going ahead vigorously with the things about which we know and to continue searching out those aspects about which we do not know. The committee under the National Health Services Council is pursuing this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2971</span>
matter very vigorously with the best scientific machinery that we have in Scotland, and we now have the best statistical examination possible. I feel it is going to produce promising results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and gallant Gentleman mentioned the Medical Research Council. I ought to say that the Scottish Health Services Council work in conjunction with the Medical Research Council, and that a Scientific Advisory Committee has a liaison with them. Of course, all our discoveries or reports will be available to them, while what they do will be available to us. We certainly appreciate their help, and if we can we will give them help in those directions. At the moment we are dealing with a peculiar Scottish problem. Whilst the contrast between Scotland and England can give us some information, the contrast between some parts of Scotland and other parts of Scotland, and between one part of the population and another part of the population, produce a problem within Scotland itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of this Committee's deliberations last year a new field of inquiry was opened up. When people start asking questions that is the first step in getting an answer. I have every confidence that a new impetus has been given to research in Scotland, and I am sure the Committee will be interested to have the information which I have been able to lay before it. In the course of our discussion today, I have no doubt Members will make many suggestions which will lead to further inquiries. It is not always the expert that sees most of the game. Footballers know that the spectators play the game far better than those playing on the field. It may be that the person who is far enough away from the problem can ask a simple question which the expert would never dream of asking, and this will stimulate the expert to produce the right answer. Therefore, with the cooperation of this Committee and the research going on, plus the energy which everyone agrees my Department has put into this matter in the past year, we hope to succeed in our efforts against this terrible disease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllister</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has told us about the increase in the number of beds available. Could he give us some indication of the overall shortage of beds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2972</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Actually there is no shortage of beds. The shortage is nurses. I ought to say that the number of nurses we are getting is increasing, but we have got to keep in mind that what we have to do is to improve the conditions of nursing. Therefore, until we get many more nurses many of the new nurses now are being employed to provide the proper conditions. It is a long-term programme to get more nurses, and at the same time to get enough nurses to give staffs proper hours and conditions. A campaign was recently carried out by the Ministry of Labour. A large recruiting van went through Scotland, and even there the results have been most remarkable. In some districts there has been a splendid response, while in others there was no response at all. That is very difficult to explain. We can only hope that those girls who feel an impulse to help their fellow men—there are many fine women sometimes at a loss to find a kind of activity in which they can be helpful—will be willing to volunteer to give their services in this great cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ought to apologise for taking part in the Debate so early, especially after my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Scottish Universities (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) and the Secretary of State for Scotland have spoken. My right hon. and gallant Friend speaks with a wealth of knowledge in connection with matters concerning health. I must confess, however, that many of the fears and anxieties which I had, and which were shared by other hon. Members, have not been dispelled by what has been said by the Secretary of State. When we discussed the same subject last year it was then stated that the figures given were the highest for 20 years. We have now had information given to us which we are told contains figures which are the highest for 50 years. In 1945 the notifications of tuberculosis numbered 7,316. In 1948 the notifications had gone up to 8,010. The number of deaths recorded in 1945 was 2,932. By 1948 the deaths had risen to 3,417.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this very excellent Report of the Department of Health for Scotland, there are included these words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The incidence, as evidenced by notifications, still continues to increase although there is some indication that cases … are being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2973</span>
notified at a much earlier age than in pre-war days. Even so, the results are disappointing and have given the Department much concern."</p></blockquote>
If the Department of Health are concerned, then I am sure every hon. Member in this Committee must be equally concerned at the conditions in Scotland in connection with this curse. We have all been very much impressed by the statement made by the Secretary of State for Scotland in this Committee that the committee which has been set up has carried out so much very important work. I agree with my right hon. and gallant Friend that after 12 months we might at least have had some sort of report as to what the committee has been doing. The Secretary of State for Scotland said that there was a good deal of mystery about the figures, but he was not prepared at the present time to make them all public for fear that that should give rise to public misconception. Owing to the courtesy of the Department of Health my right hon. and gallant Friend has been furnished with tables, schedules and all kinds of information, and he could therefore speak with a sense of authority possessed by none of the rest of us. We are very largely in the air about what the position is at the present moment. We know that the committee has been set up and has carried on its work. I hope that at a very early date it will result in a lessening of the anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the whole country there is a growing consciousness of the dreadful state of affairs caused by this disease. In 1945, the number of patients in the hospitals was 4,253. The beds available were 4,493, but in the same year 732 beds were empty and there was a waiting list of 1,639. I turn from 1945 to 1948, when the number of patients in the institutions was 4,462, the beds available were 4,707, the beds empty were 572 and there was a waiting list of 2,572. Those figures bring before us at once the problem of staffing. The Secretary of State indicated that a tour of Scotland had been made in order to get more staff and that in some areas there had been a good response while in others the result was disappointing. Has there been a lack of imagination on the part of the Department of Health in trying to get nurses? Many methods might be adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I cannot remember any appeal being made on the wireless for young women to respond to the call for
	<span class='label label-info column'>2974</span>
nurses. I sometimes listen in to the man who is called the "Radio Doctor." He talks about children and the birth of children, and all kinds of subjects in which I have no immediate interest. He puts his stuff over in the most amusing manner, and he is always attractive because he puts matters in the very simplest way so that anybody who is a mere child in the science of medicine can comprehend him. Why could we not engage a man such as that? I am convinced that young women in Scotland are not lacking in the spirit of Florence Nightingale for the needs of suffering humanity. Could we not give an outlet for that spirit of unselfishness to help those who are less fortunate than the majority? The radio might be used to a greater extent in the future than in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a great man for the theatre but I remember seeing one play called "The Forgotten Factor," which was placed on the stage in order to create a happier spirit in industry. That was something new, a play which carried a message for happier relationships between master and man. I am not certain that the same means could not be used in this case. I do not mean that the horrors and anxieties of tuberculosis should be put on the stage, but that the theatre might be used to inspire young women to the gladness of service for others and the satisfaction that comes from service well done, quite apart from any pecuniary reward. I know that a committee is sitting to review the conditions existing within the nursing service and that its report will be out very soon. There must be something wrong when there are 572 beds lying empty in Scotland while 2,572 people are on the waiting list anxious to use those beds to be restored to their wonted health and strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not satisfied about the allocation of houses to people who are supposed to be suffering from active tuberculosis. In Glasgow the number of cases on the waiting list in 1945 was 437. In 1946 it was 462, in 1947 it had gone up to 568 and in 1948 it had risen to 593. During the four years there was a total of 2,060. Those people were all certified as being the right kind of people to get the houses on account of their illness and their overcrowding. Only 763 people were rehoused in that city. Nobody who knows the trials and tribulations suffered by

	<span class='label label-info column'>2975</span>
people with T.B. better than hon. Members opposite because they represent very largely the industrial areas, but we all could give instances which would almost break the heart and would bring tears to the eyes about over-crowding of people with young families. There are many cases of men who have come back from the war. have married and cannot get houses.

I should not like to think that any charge of complacency was made against any medical officer of health. I believe that they are all worried and anxious about this disease.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very important point. Perhaps I might get back to the line that I was pursuing. We were told by the Secretary of State for Scotland exactly a year ago that in 1938 23 per

cent. of the houses in Scotland were overcrowded compared with only 3.8 in England. He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is the grim fact we have to face now. So far as I can judge, our percentage at the moment is not less than this, and England's may be slightly improved.

It is estimated that somewhere in the world someone dies of tuberculosis every seven seconds. In this country it ranks fifth among the killing diseases, and it is the most important of the social diseases.

hoped that the situation would be greatly improved. I will ask him now what has been happening in the intervening year, particularly in the matters about which I have spoken. Housing is linked up with tuberculosis in a real way. I believe that it is the vital factor and that until we can get more houses for the people and segregate our countrymen and women they will not have a chance to live a happier and healthier life in the future than they have lived in the past. I hope that the Secretary of State will use ail his power, knowledge and strength, and that he will show goodwill, sympathy, courage and devotion in attempting to stem the tide of tuberculosis and bring Scotland back into being a happier and healthier place in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cullen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the hon. Gentleman who has just spoken, I will not apologise for dealing with this terrible scourge, especially as it affects the constituency which I represent. The matter with which I wish to deal is that concerning the use of empty hospital beds for tuberculosis cases and the use of trained personnel to the best advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Glasgow, we have empty beds due to shortage of staff, and some hospitals beds occupied by patients who do not require trained nursing personnel—I refer to aged and infirm people who require only the services of a kindly woman to look after them and keep them clean. At present trained personnel are being used for this particular job, and I think the Secretary of State should consider a scheme whereby we could take these unfortunate old people into some other place and obtain some women who, like myself, are widows, and who are looking for work and could do this particular job. If we could clear two wards in a large hospital of that type of person and provide that they are cared for elsewhere, it would enable us to use the trained personnel to much greater advantage. In Glasgow, the nurses are complaining that they are not receiving their proper training because of the kind of cases which they have to look after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a district where people are dying like flies from tuberculosis, and I will give two instances of which I think the Committee should be informed. I have been trying for two months to get
	<span class='label label-info column'>2978</span>
a young man suffering from tuberculosis admitted to hospital. He has been living in a single room in an apartment house with five young children under seven years of age. Can anybody tell me that a man living in a single apartment house, suffering from tuberculosis and with five young children all in one room—and nobody can keep children away from their father—will not infect his children with that disease? I tried to get that man into hospital and I contacted the medical officer. I said to him, "If you cannot find a bed anywhere else, take him to the poor house, but, for God's sake, take him away from these young children." The medical officer eventually found a bed, but unfortunately, the young man was dead at 30 years of age before it was found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I heard of a young girl also suffering from tuberculosis and requiring a hospital bed. Her father, suffering from the same disease, has been on the waiting list for over a year, and his daughter, aged 16, was in another room and there were four other children in the house. I tried to get the girl away and I told the mother last week, "If you do not hear any more by Friday, let me know and I will contact the Secretary of State and he will do something." However, the girl was taken away, and her father, who had been waiting for a year to get a hospital bed, said he was quite willing to die at home if something could be done for his girl.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could multiply that kind of case by hundreds, and I make an appeal to the Secretary of State to consider some scheme whereby he can release the trained personnel who are now looking after the aged and infirm by providing that these patients are cared for elsewhere by someone else. I think by that means he could ensure that the aged and infirm were properly cared for, while the trained personnel would be able to take more of these tuberculous people out of their present distressing surroundings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Commander Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to intervene for a few minutes because I regard tuberculosis as the greatest scourge and evil which faces Scotland at present. Some months ago, I received a letter accompanied by a very interesting and informative memorandum from the Edinburgh local

	<span class='label label-info column'>2979</span>
medical committee inviting my assistance in the campaign against this disease. The overcrowded districts of my constituency are affected, but I must say that, as a layman, I am not qualified to speak or comment on matters of treatment, though there are one or two suggestions of a general nature which I would like to put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The magnitude of the problem before us was clearly stated by my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Scottish Universities (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) in opening this discussion, and, indeed, it is obvious from a study of the figures in Appendix 10 of the Annual Report that it is a very serious problem. If my arithmetic is correct, more than 38,000 people at present are known to be suffering from tuberculosis of both types in Scotland, and I fear that that figure must be an under-estimate, because one imagines that there are probably a great many cases not yet discovered or notified. It is distressing, bearing in mind that overall figure, that there should be so many empty beds due to the lack of staff, while the waiting lists are increasing. I understood from the Secretary of State that since the publication of this Report a certain number of these beds have been brought into use again and that the staffs have been augmented to some extent. Perhaps the Joint Under-Secretary could give us a little more information when he replies on the subject of recruitment, which is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deficiency in nursing staff is given in Appendix 14 as 6,333, but that is an overall figure of all types of nurses, and it would be of great interest to the Committee to have that figure broken down and some indication given of the actual deficiency of nurses for tubercular cases. It seems to me, as a layman, that some part at least of this shortage of staff for the nursing of tubercular cases might well be due to the fear of infection. One knows only too well from experience in one's own constituency that there is a very great risk of the disease being passed from one member of a household to another, and there must be a distinct element of risk to nurses who undertake this form of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very glad to note that it is the intention of the Secretary of State to introduce the B.C.G. form of vaccination and offer it to nurses who are willing to
	<span class='label label-info column'>2980</span>
undertake this type of service, and I hope that it will give a greater confidence and protection to all engaged. I do not pretend to know the details of this form of vaccination, but I understand that it has. been used successfully in many areas in the Scandinavian countries, notably Denmark and Sweden, and I hope that its use here will give very satisfactory results. We know that, in another connection, through the immunisation campaign, infection from diphtheria has been very much reduced, and I hope that the introduction of vaccination by B.C.G. will be helpful to the people engaged in nursing and in making immune persons who are living in contact with tubercular cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most immediate problem before us at the moment is to stop the spread of infection, and, apart from vaccination, there are two things that might be done which are mentioned in the memorandum submitted by the Edinburgh local medical committee. A more extended use might be made of the system of health visitors to detect cases of tuberculosis as early as possible and keep them under observation, and, further, it might be that more mass radiography units could be brought into use in Scotland. There are at present four of these units in the country, and it would be helpful if we could get more. Perhaps the Joint Under-Secretary will comment on these two matters in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When all is said and done, the most important measure that can be adopted to stop the spread of infection is the reduction of overcrowding in houses. The Secretary of State himself produced an interesting graph showing how the figures were much worse in the congested burgh districts, more especially in the west of Scotland, and it must be obvious to us all, and it is confirmed by medical opinion, that the finest ally of tuberculosis is overcrowding. That point was emphasised in a very important resolution which was passed unanimously by a conference of Scottish local medical committees held in Edinburgh in February, which reads as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Conference calls attention to the very unsatisfactory state of the Tuberculosis Service throughout the country, and particularly to the fact that open and infectious cases are kept at home in overcrowded houses. While fully-aware of the difficulties of staffing and accommodation, the conference feels that these difficulties are not insuperable, and calls for immediate and effective action to eliminate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1543">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2981</span>
the danger to the public by, for instance, a higher allocation of houses by local authorities to tuberculosis cases."</p></blockquote>
That point is further stressed in the memorandum from the Edinburgh committee, which stressed that there should be absolute priority for cases where there were active tuberculous patients in overcrowded houses. We know from this Report and from what the Secretary of State told us today that something is being done in the provision of houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Joint Under-Secretary to clear up one point about which I am not certain. I understand that 1,000 aluminium bungalows are available for this purpose, and, after that, there are to be 4,000 Blackburn houses. That is definitely a very welcome step, but it will of course take some little time to get these houses erected, and, in the meantime, though I dislike very much indeed central interference with the local authorities' conduct of affairs, on a matter of this nature, where the spread of infection is really a national problem, I think the Secretary of State might at least advise all local authorities very strongly to give an absolute and immediate priority to tubercular cases with a view to dispersing households where at present one person is infecting others. I know that priority is supposed to be given at the present time, but I am afraid, from correspondence I have received, that quite often there is considerable delay in dealing with these cases where there is an active sufferer from tuberculosis in the household who is spreading the disease to others. I ask the Joint Under-Secretary to consider sending out another strongly-worded piece of advice on this subject to the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.1 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hubbard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Personally, I prefer to leave the treatment of tuberculosis to experts. On the other hand, the prevention of tuberculosis is something which is a matter for everyone and is a subject upon which not nearly sufficient is known by the average member of the public. If I have a complaint to make it is not on the question of issuing figures that may cause alarm. In any case, I do not think the word "alarm" is the correct one; I think it should be "great concern." I think the more figures which are given about these things, the more people
	<span class='label label-info column'>2982</span>
will be able to co-operate in the prevention of tuberculosis and be able to show their willingness to assist in combating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is absolutely necessary that a campaign should be started in this country by the Government through whom the absolute limit of information should be given to every individual about the causes of tuberculosis, the means of preventing contact with it and of preventing its spread. Far too often we have heard, at the unfortunate conclusion of a case of tuberculosis, "If we had only known at the beginning." People ought to know at the beginning, and I suggest to the Secretary of State that that is one of the points to which we ought to give very careful attention at the moment. The very fullest information ought to be given to everyone; every parent ought to know all there is to be known about the causes of tuberculosis and how to prevent contact with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that would go a long way towards the prevention of the disease. We must have the co-operation of everyone in this matter. I believe in segregation, but I believe education is of equal importance. Therefore, together with segregation, let us go on with the education of the people. We are never able to hide things because we close our eyes to them, the more people's eyes are open to the danger, the better it will be for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that because of mass radiography we ought not to be gravely concerned about the number of notifications. The more there is of mass radiography and that sort of thing, the better. We ought, however, to be gravely concerned by this higher incidence which is being revealed—the higher incidence of deaths. On the other hand, the very fact that we are grappling with the problem is, I think, sufficient for the moment. Like everyone else I am anxious to see the report of the committee, but we ought not to press them to get on with it too much, which may hasten them to come to too early conclusions. They should receive every possible scrap of information they can obtain and make themselves up-to-date before they present their considerations to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me more than anything else in connection with T.B. is the scarcity of nurses. The scarcity of hospital beds is something which could be overcome if we had sufficient nurses, and I wonder
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2983</span>
whether we are approaching in the right way the problem of obtaining nurses for tuberculosis hospitals. Are we making the profession sufficiently attractive? In the long run we have to make this profession more attractive than it is. Young girls will enter these particular forms of nursing provided the profession is made attractive enough. For a long time I have been convinced that, no matter how we deal with the actual hours of duty of nurses and sisters in hospitals, we shall never have a satisfactory state of affairs until we reach a situation whereby, when nurses have completed their hours of duty, they will be able to live a normal life away from the atmosphere of the hospital. It is a very bad thing that when nurses come off duty after a spread-over day they still have to live within the grounds of the hospital and never get away from that atmosphere. In the new housing schemes provision ought to be made so that nurses can live a normal life and not be segregated from the people all the time—a place where they can go at the end of the working day. The more normal we make the life of the nurse, the more attraction there will be to bring decent girls into the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to housing, we in our district have for many years regarded T.B. cases as a first priority. Furthermore, we have made arrangements that an additional room should be made available where there is tuberculosis. Here again, however, this is something which should be tackled on a national and not a local basis. There ought not to be differences between one town and another, or one area and another, so far as housing for these cases is concerned. I heard with great satisfaction what the Secretary of State said about taking advantage of the available bricklayers to get some additional houses built. But if tuberculosis is to be tackled on a national scale, then everything appertaining to it should also be tackled on a national scale; it ought not to be left to the whims of the good local authority or the bad local authority as to what arrangements are made to provide proper housing for people who are suffering from tuberculosis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think more powers ought to be retained in the hands of the Secretary of State. He should be able to instruct local authorities that housing provision must be made for these people. In spite of all what I know has been done in
	<span class='label label-info column'>2984</span>
health committees in my own constituency, I have known of infectious tuberculosis cases being sent home from the hospital into overcrowded houses because of the shortage of nurses. No matter what we may do, so far as this Committee is concerned, and so far as immunisation is concerned, we shall never prevent the spread of tuberculosis until we have overcome that sort of thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I think we can expect the Secretary of State to go that one step further and see to it that every member of the public knows all that can be known. Nothing should be hidden. Every mother ought to know every possible step she can take to protect her child. She gets all assistance so far as diphtheria is concerned and any amount of publicity is given about immunisation—and that is a good thing. I do not know why there is not equal information given to parents about tuberculosis. There ought to be. It may be that the incidence of the disease is not so high, but it is just as dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat, let us give people all the information we can. Do not suppress figures. Where people give false figures, let us take immediate action against them. It is too important a subject for people to be misled upon it. Those are the two points I stress—provide all possible information and make the nursing profession as attractive as any other profession; give the nurses a normal life outside their ordinary hospital hours and let them live like ordinary people. I am satisfied that in the long run this is the correct approach to this matter and in the end could be the most effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.10 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the disease of tuberculosis fills most people with a horror, a dread and a pity for those who suffer from it. I think many people are bewildered by it—I know I am. It is as unaccountable to us today as was the Black Death to people living in mediaeval times. Certainly, it is most extraordinary that, although all other forms of medicine are showing an improvement, here, in tuberculosis, there has been this steady deterioration so that today the disease takes as big a toll as it did 29 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a serious matter that this should be so, and it is an extremely mysterious matter. Why should this incidence be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2985</span>
so much higher in Scotland than in England, and why particularly higher in Glasgow? Is it something to do with our climate, or something to do with the work we do, or something to do with our social habits, or something, perhaps, to do with the way we treat the disease? The Report makes no attempt to answer these imponderables, and the committee which the Secretary of State set up last year has also remained silent. I believe it is a great pity that this committee have not issued some kind of preliminary report which would shed some light upon this problem. Today we are like a blind man in a dark room looking for a door which perhaps does not even exist. I believe that anything which the committee can do to throw some light upon this problem, and which would do something to reduce the ignorance which exists, ought to be produced by the Secretary of State at the earliest possible moment, because so long as this ignorance continues we are prejudicing the chances of people regaining their health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore ask the Secretary of State to urge this committee to issue some sort of report so that we may have some kind of directive to our efforts at the earliest possible moment. It is because of this lack of specific recommendation that, speaking purely as a layman without any medical knowledge at all, I feel I must say where I think some improvement might be made in our existing service and in our existing line of attack. I think the battle against tuberculosis can be looked at from two points of view—first, the medical point of view and, second, the health point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the medical side is concerned, are our patients getting the best possible treatment and are they going to continue getting the best possible treatment? I am very doubtful whether they will continue to get the best possible treatment, and I will tell the Committee why. At the Conference of the British Medical Association, which has been held recently in Harrogate, the fear was expressed that tuberculosis officers would be classified as senior hospital officers and not as specialists. If that is so, I can imagine nothing which would have a worse effect on curing the disease. Here we have a disease, tuberculosis, which is testing the whole of medical science and, therefore, we
	<span class='label label-info column'>2986</span>
need to attract to the study of tuberculosis our most able and talented doctors. I do not think the way to attract them to that study is to lower their status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, therefore, like to ask the Secretary of State what are his intentions with regard to the people who are working on tuberculosis? Are they to remain as specialists, or are they to become senior hospital officers? I think that from the answer which the right hon. Gentleman gives to that question the Committee will know whether he really means business. Turning to the health aspect of this problem, I think there is little doubt about what the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) said, that housing is the real crux of the matter. I shall not turn this into a Debate on housing or criticise the Secretary of State's housing policy. I think for the purposes of this Debate we must accept as a maximum the number of houses he has been able to produce since he came into power. I shall not say anything about the number of houses, but I want to ask this: is the Secretary of State making the best use of the houses he has been able to produce?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether he is doing so. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart (Mr. John Henderson) pointed out, taking the figures for Glasgow, in the last four years only 763 tuberculin-affected families—if I may refer to them in that way—have been re-housed, which means that there are 1,300 families in Glasgow today, some of whose members are infected with T.B., who are living in conditions which are likely to encourage the growth of this disease. That does not appear to me to be at all wise. Surely, people who have tuberculosis should be given absolute priority in obtaining new houses. I should like to go even a good deal further and say, that so long as the present appalling shortage of nurses continues there should be set aside in each city of ours certain houses for the exclusive use of people suffering from tuberculosis. I am not a doctor and I admit that I am looking at this only from a layman's point of view, but it seems to me most extraordinary that people who are suffering from what I am led to believe is a highly infectious disease should not be segregated in some way from the rest of the community. If the Secretary of State has followed this part of my argument, I urge him to do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2987</span>
something to protect the lives of the community from this unnecessary sort of infection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to page 31 of the Report, where, at the foot, it is said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Medical Officer of Health, now relieved of his clinical responsibility for tuberculosis treatment, will have more time to devote to the … social and preventive aspects of the disease."</p></blockquote>
I think that that is a most significant statement, because I believe that here there is great scope for immediate improvement. Limiting factors do exist, and the Committee must admit that they do exist so far as an immediate improvement of houses, an increase in the number of nurses and the quality of food are concerned, all of which would have an effect on the treatment of tuberculosis; but so far as personal and domestic hygiene are concerned those limiting factors do not exist, and it is my belief that a real advance along those lines would produce most beneficial results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished how ignorant people still are of the most elementary rules of health. I was visiting recently in my constituency. It was a fine day, but not in one single house was there a window open. In one house there were a man, his wife and nine children, all living in the same room. In those circumstances it is not at all surprising that a virulent disease such as tuberculosis should thrive and increase. Here it is that the Secretary of State has a real opportunity of doing something. As the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Hubbard) said, what we want is a national poster and Press campaign along the lines of the V.D. campaign, which will impress upon people the elementary rules of health and impress upon them the need for early treatment if a cure is to be effected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think this ought to be reinforced by instruction in the schools, and also by inspection of our factories, our cinemas and other places of entertainment, and, particularly, our large stores, such as Woolworth's, where the air is very far from being pure, and, indeed, in my opinion, is most unhealthy. Today the circumstances are such that to a large extent we are forced to rely on nature. Nature is a good physician if given a chance, and it is my contention that today, because of the ignorance of the ordinary person, nature is not being given
	<span class='label label-info column'>2988</span>
a chance. If only the Secretary of State would harness to what he is already doing the recuperative forces of nature by a campaign for domestic and personal hygiene, he would considerably reduce the number of potential victims of tuberculosis and make the present admittedly difficult times times of improvement and not, as they are now, of stagnation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Galbraith) will forgive me if I do not follow him along the line he has taken.

Gentleman has made his meaning a little clearer, but it seemed unnecessary to say that he would decide, on what seemed to me to be flimsy grounds, whether the Secretary of State meant business or not. I believe that the Secretary of State, and everyone connected with him, and all of us in this Committee, are really desirous of getting to grips with this scourge and tackling it in the most effective possible manner. The greater part of the discussion has been directed towards remedial measures. I am not going to talk about remedies. I want to say a word or two about prevention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constituency I have the honour to represent is, in a very considerable measure, a dormitory for cities such as Edinburgh. Many people who live in my constituency travel to the city to work each day, starting early in the morning and returning at night. Doctors with whom I have discussed this question of the rise in the incidence of tuberculosis—and nurses, too—have indicated to me their belief that the conditions under which many people, who make these journeys each day, conduct their lives, are inimical to their best interests in keeping
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2989</span>
clear of this disease. Let me say in passing that it is rather difficult to believe that an incidence of this kind will prevail when one looks around and observes the fine, strong, sturdy children on every hand, better looking and obviously healthier than ever children were in the past. It is difficult to believe such an incidence will prevail when we consider the fine young people we see around us in early womanhood and manhood—fine and healthy, and wonderfully good looking. I am thinking more particularly of those of the other sex, because when I see young people gathered together on holiday or at a festival, I say one can easily pick amongst them many a beauty chorus. Moreover, I do not think that my constituency is necessarily exceptional in this particular respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, those people with whom I have had conversations about the incidence of this disease attribute its onset to the way in which these young people live, more particularly the young women. They leave their homes early in the morning to go to Edinburgh by bus. They leave home at about seven o'clock after only a hurried breakfast. They work all day, perhaps, in factories. Perhaps they may have had a meal at their works in a canteen in the daytime. They return home at five o'clock at night. They have another hurried meal. After their evening meal they are away out three, four or five nights in the week to dance until midnight. The result is, so I am told, that they find themselves debilitated, and easy prey to the scourge of tuberculosis. I could not agree more with the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Hubbard) about the necessity of education in connection with this matter. I believe that a great deal of the incidence of this disease could be prevented and kept down by proper instruction of people about the way in which they sap their energies and reduce their resistance to such diseases by the way in which they live their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other factors, of course, that make for this rise in the figures of tuberculosis, but on looking at the Report by the Department of Health on this matter I find justification for the statements that have been made to me along the lines I have indicated when I look
	<span class='label label-info column'>2990</span>
at the figures on page 77, where the incidence of tuberculosis is dealt with by age groups. It is quite clear that the highest incidence of tuberculosis is detected between the ages of 15 and 25, which are the ages of those young people of whom I have been talking. There is a far higher incidence of the disease among females than among males. Not to weary the Committee, I will take only the total figures. There are 615 more, cases of females than males notified between 15 and 25. This higher incidence among females continues, though not at such a steep rate, between the ages of 25 and 35. Even there, there is a majority of females of 148.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As people get older the incidence is more amongst males than females. I think there is a point here, that these young women should be warned of the dangers they run in leading their lives as they do and enjoying themselves as they do. I think there is room for education along that line, and that such education would be very important in preventing an increase of this disease. I want strictly to limit myself to saying something about prevention. This is a point which has not been mentioned by anyone. Perhaps it is not considered palatable to make such a direct statement as I have made. I make it on the basis of information given to me by doctors and nurses in my constituency and I ask for it the most earnest consideration of the Secretary of State and those acting with him, who I believe are working earnestly and well to deal with this terrible scourge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Gomme-Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Mathers) has touched on a very important subject in this matter, but I am not quite sure whether it gives us the answer to the problem. I do not think that the lads and lassies of his constituency or mine, or of any other hon. Member for Scotland, do more dancing than do their brothers and sisters in the south, where the figures for tuberculosis are a great deal better. If it is having an unfortunate effect on their health, which I think quite possible, though I did indulge myself when I was that age, why are the figures not rising in the south as well as in the north?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a problem to which we cannot get an answer now, but it is not completely right that it is only their way of

	<span class='label label-info column'>2991</span>
living which is affecting them adversely. The question of beauty choruses is another matter. If the right hon. Gentleman thinks that Linlithgow produces anything approaching Perth in that respect, all I can say is I do not wish to disappoint him. However, for hundreds of years fair maids unfortunately have been exported from Perth in large numbers, but still there are large numbers at home. That is not a matter which is connected with T.B., but I wanted to put the right hon. Gentleman right.

I believe that the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hillhead (Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith) of hygiene, both personal and domestic, is one which cannot be over-stressed. I witnessed the other day some cakes, cookies and loaves being brought into a small shop in a village where a girl with a very bad cough—I will not put it any higher than that—was receiving these goods, which were rapidly pounced upon by the women and housewives. She put them into bags, and over and over again she licked her fingers to pick up the bags and blew them open. That is the type of thing that one sees all over the country today, and it is quite understandable that it is done in a hurry. It is probable that everyone of us does something of that kind without thinking of what we are doing, and a campaign on what is going on at the moment should be undertaken to impress upon old and young alike the necessity for personal hygiene.

In regard to this question of opening windows, if any of us drive through the towns or villages of Scotland or England at night not more than one per cent. of the windows will be found to be open when people are sleeping. That is one of the main causes of the trouble. Personally, I cannot sleep for one moment when the window is shut. That is the way that I was brought up. Hon. Members may say that the result is fortunate or unfortunate, but at least that is how it is with me. This unfortunate fear of fresh air is a point which needs consideration. In the matter of T.B., I am quite convinced it is of the utmost importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Gomme-Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, not only on my own behalf, for I realise I was generating a great deal of hot air, but also on behalf of our colleagues here, who do not like being disturbed in their slumbers before lunch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of diet is another thing that wants careful consideration in the relation to the incidence of T.B. I am one of those who believe that we must get down to the fundamental source of the matter of diet. We must go rjght back to the soil. That may seem a far cry from T.B., but I am perfectly convinced that the food produced today has been interfered with at its source, which is the soil, to the detriment of the resistance powers of our young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of nurses is one which is not going to be settled very quickly. That point has already been stressed, and we have been told that unfortunately the Florence Nightingale spirit is no longer there. I think that is a tragedy, because when I was a young man young women from every class of society regarded it as an honour to go into the nursing profession. Now there seems to be something different. It has become much more a matter of pounds, shillings and pence. I admit that that side of it is important, because we have no reason to impose upon women conditions which are undesirable in this profession and take advantage of their natural enthusiasm. I hope everyone interested in this problem, by personal encouragement in public and private, will try to get our young women to go into the nursing profession, which, after all, is a natural bent of every woman.

Finally, I should like the Joint Under-Secretary to deal with one point which was mentioned by his right hon. Friend. The Secretary of State, when talking about the difficulties of getting some idea of how these figures differ so much in different cases, mentioned the West of Ireland as being a place which was particularly bad for the incidence of T.B. I am wondering whether we are in consultation with the Southern Ireland Government, or whatever that part of Ireland is called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Gomme-Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Republic of Ireland, but all Irishmen are not willing to accept that name. The hon. Gentleman knows which Government I mean. Are we in consultation with them as to the possible reasons why there should be this high incidence of tuberculosis in what is purely an agricultural district? So far as I can make out the only county in Scotland, apart from the industrial areas, where the incidence is going up rather than down is Ross and Cromarty, which is an agricultural area. On the question of housing, I want to stress not only bad housing in the towns as one of the probable causes of T.B. but also the question of bad housing in the countryside. We should not ignore that, although the figures for the countryside are happier. If Southern Ireland could give us figures I am sure it would be of great assistance, and I hope it will not be overlooked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.39 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only a few points to put. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Mathers) made unreasonably heavy weather over the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hillhead (Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith) on the status of tuberculosis officers. Clearly one is not going to judge the Secretary of State's sincerity entirely by this matter. I agree that this is a bit extreme, but it would be a great pity if the Committee went away with the idea that the question of status is a small matter. That must be borne in mind, and the entry of young doctors into this specialised branch of medicine must be affected by that decision. I do not put it any higher than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mathers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman the Member for Hillhead (Mr. T.G.D. Galbraith) made himself a little more clearly understood by the interruption he made to my remarks, but even then the question of the sincerity of the Secretary of State being dependent upon an answer to a question of that kind was too much for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason I mentioned it at all was not only because the right Bon. Gentleman appeared to have some strong view about it, but that the hon. Member for Leith (Mr. Hoy) made some noises, which may or may not have reached the OFFICIAL REPORT, which indicated his dissent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2994</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But which reached the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the layman's point of view there are two points which are readily understandable and which give cause for concern. The first is the availability of nurses and the second is the housing question. I could not agree more with what has been said in regard to housing, but on that subject we will have an opportunity before the House rises to discuss housing in Scotland. I want to bring out two points about the nursing position. We have got to tackle this job in order to make the profession attractive for nurses to take up nursing, and particularly sanatorium nursing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder if hon. Members have studied the figures which appeared in the report of the Working Party on Recruitment. I would be grateful if we could be told whether the sub-committee set up by the Secretary of State on this question of tuberculosis has within its terms of reference the problem of nurses in sanatoria. The figures given are very upsetting, because if we look at the estimated intake and wastage of student nurses based on the years 1937, 1943 and 1945, which are the only figures I have been able to get hold of, we find that the total intake was over 23,000 and the average wastage over the whole range in the different types of nursing 54 per cent. The least is general hospital nurses at 37 per cent., but the tuberculosis sanatoria rise is as high as 65 per cent. The only type higher is, of course, mental hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It becomes even more interesting when one studies the reasons for wastage, for one finds that the failure to complete the course through resignations is 48 per cent., and that again is a far higher percentage than in any other category except the mental hospitals. I could have understood it better if it were not much higher than infectious diseases, because knowing what I do of sanatoria I would have thought that the normal conditions of life and the work for nurses there was considerably better than would be the case in infectious diseases hospitals, where infectious diseases are more disturbing to deal with in many ways than tuberculosis. I hope these two aspects are being studied by the sub-committee so that we can discover why the tuberculosis sanatoria wastage is so extremely high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLean Watson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to take up many minutes; I have arranged with the Joint Under-Secretary to confine my remarks to one or two matters. As one who was a member of a sanatorium board for a number of years, I have listened to the discussion with considerable interest. I should like the Joint Under-Secretary to turn his attention to one aspect of the recruiting problem. I believe that in the past we have made a mistake in the siting of our sanatoria. I was a member of a sanatorium board which erected two sanatoria a considerable distance from the industrial area. They were rather out of the way. The two sanatoria available for patients in the county of Fife are at Glen Lomond and Ochil Hills, and are pretty well out of the way. One of the difficulties is in getting nurses to work in these places because they are so far from anywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties of local authorities in the staffing of their hospitals and sanatoria is that although sanatoria may be well built they are inaccessible. If the regional hospital boards are considering any development in these matters they should see that sanatoria are placed not too far out of the areas which they are supposed to serve. Sanatoria should not be inaccessible by road or rail but should be within reasonable distance. It may seem absurd to suggest building more sanatoria when beds cannot be filled in the sanatoria that we have, owing to shortage of nurses, but I believe that the shortage of nurses will pass away. A sanatorium which was erected by the local authority of which I was a member was placed on the eastern shore of Loch Leven. It was an ideal spot, but most inaccessible; making it difficult for patients to receive visits from their friends or to pay visits, and making for greater difficulty in keeping nurses. During recent years some attention has been given to the entertainment of nurses in sanatoria. I hope that in the new set-up more attention will be given to the points that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discussion that has taken place this morning has awakened memories of many discussions that we had on our local authority in connection with the running of that sanatorium. I can understand
	<span class='label label-info column'>2996</span>
children being in a more favourable position than the older people, because by the medical inspection in schools the disease can be detected in the children, and treatment can toe given. Our difficulty was to get people to report to the doctor when they were ill, instead of concealing the disease until it got a proper hold. Doctors were always complaining that cases were not reported early enough for the necessary treatment to be given to effect a cure. Patients were sent to the sanatorium in a hopeless condition. I hope that the result of our discussion this morning will be a real attack upon the disease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.50 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Thomas Fraser)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I took the right decision in allowing everyone to speak who wanted to get into the discussion before I rose. I am afraid that I have left myself little time in which to reply to the many points which have been raised. We have had a most useful Debate. No one has shown complacency with regard to tuberculosis in Scotland. Many hon. Members have pointed to the factors which may or may not be responsible for the high rate of that tuberculosis. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland is anxious that all those who have a contribution to make or an idea to suggest will come forward with it. He is anxious that as much information as possible should be made available to health authorities and to Members of Parliament, as well as to the medical profession, by all those who have a contribution to offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to say a word about the committee which has been set up. I have been appealed to several times this morning to say that this committee will produce a report soon. The hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. J. Henderson) said: "Let us have some sort of report." We do not want just some sort of report. The right hon. and gallant Member for the Scottish Universities (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) will agree that the committee is doing a most important job of work for Scotland. The committee must conduct its researches thoroughly. It must try to find out why the rate of death from tuberculosis should be going up in one part of the country and not in another, and in what age groups and occupations the rise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2997</span>
is taking place. It must learn something of the social habits of the people in whom the increase in deaths from tuberculosis is taking place, the kind of houses they are living in, whether they are married or single, and how they are likely to have been infected by the disease. There is a lot of work available to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the committee are interested in getting to the root of the problem and that they will do their work as quickly as possible. None of us would ask the committee to rush into print with a publication of some facts before they were satisfied that they had got enough facts on which to base a conclusion. When they are doing the job let us give them every encouragement we can to do it thoroughly. One or two Members have suggested that we might not be getting an efficient diet. It would be silly of any of us to discount that completely as a factor in the high rate of tuberculosis in Scotland, but it might be that there is a deficiency in the diet and that the committee will make that discovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of it, some of us may be excused if we are less inclined to accept that suggestion as a material factor. The diet of Scotland is no different from the diet of England and Wales. It may be that owing to the climatic conditions of Scotland we should have something more in addition to the diet throughout the country, and therefore deficiency in diet might very well be considered. Let us remember Aberdeen, however, which has the lowest rate of tuberculosis for any city of its size in Great Britain. The diet in Aberdeen is undoubtedly not different from the diet in towns all over the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is suggested that herrings are an important element in the diet of Aberdeen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are other places in Scotland which, one believes, eat quite a lot of herring but where death from tuberculosis is very high indeed. There is Lewis, one of the blackest spots. It has been black for many years, although I believe that they eat a certain amount of herring there. Let us not attach too much importance to any one of the factors and run away with the idea that one such factor is all-important. On the other hand, let us not put it completely aside. If that were the cause, perhaps the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2998</span>
worsening position would manifest itself in the children. The number of notifications of children has gone up a little, but that is no doubt due to mass radiography in Scotland permitting earlier detection. The important thing is that the rate of death of those under 15 years old is going down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In thinking of the worsening position in Scotland, we must not imagine that it is general to the whole of Scotland and that the improving position is general to the whole of England and Wales. We have heard that in the North of England there is evidence of the graph having gone up, and again of its being somewhat more level recently, although there is not a downward trend yet. The figures show that the town which may be said to have worsened most in the last 10 years is Jarrow. In 1938 there were 78 deaths from tuberculosis per 100,000 of population. In 1947 the figure was 110. Glasgow is second in the list with 85 deaths in 1938 and 105 in 1947. The next is Dundee, with 62 deaths in 1938 and 82 in 1947. Then comes Liverpool, fluctuating about 80 in each of those years. I said something a year ago which I would like to repeat now. I cannot get it out of my mind that the worsening position in tuberculosis is constant where poverty was greatest in the last 20 years. I do not want to make any political point out of it, but I am stating a fact. The dreadful poverty over the last 20 or 30 years was constant over that period, and it may be found that the tuberculosis rate in those areas is going up at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very interesting observation, but I would ask why the figure is not going up in South Wales. South Wales is an exception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not the figures for the Welsh towns with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Elliot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman unnecessarily, but his suggestion is fearfully interesting and important. I looked into it, thinking that what he has suggested might be the case, but it does not hold true for South Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I shall have to leave that point, because I have too little time. The picture painted this morning is black enough in all truth, but let
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I1552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2999</span>
it not go out from this Committee to the people of Scotland that the health of Scotland is very poor. If one looks at the other criteria which are usually taken into account in measuring the health of a nation, one cannot escape the conclusion that health in Scotland is better than it ever was before. I cannot quote the figures, because there is no time, but one draws that conclusion from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Hubbard) asked that more publicity should be given to what has been done, to the measures that are being taken and the measures available. We have taken note of his suggestion and we will pass it on to the Scottish Council for Health Education.

The hon. Lady the Member for Gorbals (Mrs. Cullen) wanted greater dilution of hospitals staffs and she suggested that nurses now looking after old people might be made available for tuberculosis cases. That was a good point, well worth making, and it has not been overlooked by the Secretary of State or by the hospital boards. There is considerable dilution of staff at the present moment, although the greater number of nurses to be taken away from the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
