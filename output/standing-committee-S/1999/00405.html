	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. John Reid)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement about the implications of the Chancellor's Budget for Scotland, and to answer questions. Copies of my statement are available on the Table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to start by recognising that this year's Budget builds on the Government's achievements so far in our prudent management of the economy. The Budget takes further measures to build a stronger and fairer Britain, with actions to benefit every region and every part of the United Kingdom. But it does so only because the Government have established a record of stability and prudence in economic management, including management of the Exchequer, so that we are now able safely to release substantial new investment for public services especially, although not explicitly, for the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the management of the economy, I am pleased to say that economic growth in the United Kingdom last year ran ahead of the forecasts of the experts. We expect the United Kingdom economy to grow this year at between 2.75 per cent. and 3.25 per cent., before reverting to trend growth rates of around 2.5 per cent. next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That growth has happened without triggering inflation, which for the third year running is within our target of 2.5 per cent. Careful control of inflation now means that long-term interest rates in Britain are down to the levels of Germany, and lower than in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, 800,000 new jobs have been created in the United Kingdom. Employment levels have risen to the highest for over 30 years and unemployment has fallen to the lowest levels for over 20 years—both historically and in international terms. Those figures are reflected throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's own finances are also in better shape. We inherited a current deficit in 1997 of over £20 billion. For the year just ended, the current surplus is forecast to be ©17 billion. We have respected the rules on public spending and public borrowing which we introduced on taking office and laid down in order to promote stability and public confidence. As a result, the national debt now imposes less of a burden on our current expenditure. A total of £4 billion a year has been saved from debt interest payments and £3 billion from expenditure on unemployment benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is on this basis of sound management of the economy and of the Government's own programmes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
that we are now able to release substantial new resources for health, for education, for tackling child poverty, to help pensioners, to improve public transport and to tackle crime. Those are the priorities that people expect the Government to tackle, whether they live in Scotland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For Scotland, this will mean a £2.4 billion boost for public spending over the next four years. At the centre of the extra resources announced in the Budget is the largest ever package of spending on the NHS. Across the United Kingdom, this provides for an immediate £2 billion boost in the coming year and growth averaging 6.1 per cent. a year in real terms over the next four years—the longest period of sustained high growth in the history of the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For Scotland, decisions on the allocation of resources—allocation from within the global sum—are for the First Minister and the Scottish Executive. A statement on spending plans for the new financial year was made in the Scottish Parliament last Thursday. In that statement, Jack McConnell confirmed that the extra resources would be targeted at turning round Scotland's appalling health record, and there will be a £173 million increase in the coming year alone. That comes on top of previously agreed increases and means an extra 7.3 per cent. in real terms or £34 more for every man, woman and child. The additional resources in the Budget will provide a massive £2.2 billion investment in the NHS or almost £450 per person over the next four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 2000–01, additional resources will be allocated to priority areas, with £87 million for education to guarantee improvements and excellence in every school, nearly £9 million to guarantee safer communities by tackling crime and nearly £16 million for transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as providing better public services for all, Budget 2000 takes further steps to build a fairer society by providing extra help for those who need it most. Families and children will benefit. The Government have made no secret of the fact that we want to ensure that every child has the best possible start in life and that the tax and benefit system should support all children and recognise the extra costs and responsibility that parents face. Our ambition is to halve child poverty by the end of the decade as we move forward with our commitment to abolish it within 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 640,000 families will be better off as a result of measures in the Budget. Those include an additional £4.35 a week increase in the under-16 child credit in the working families tax credit from June 2000 and a 50p a week increase in the children's tax credit when it is introduced in April 2001. That will make it worth no less than £442 a year—more than twice the value of the married couple's allowance, which it replaces. All that comes on top of the increase in child benefit that takes effect from 10 April. Child benefit will rise to £15 for the first child and £10 for subsequent children—a 40 per cent. increase since the Government took office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
The Budget is also good news for Scotland's 920,000 pensioners. From next winter, they will benefit from the further £50 increase in the winter fuel payment to £150, which will be paid to every household with someone over 60. More than 700,000 households will benefit. There will also be an increase in the capital limits attached to the minimum income guarantee, which will mean that pensioners who have managed to save something for their retirement can still qualify for extra support. That will benefit 9,000 of the poorest pensioners. All that is in addition to the free TV licences that will be available from November to all pensioners aged 75 and over. That will benefit 250,000 households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have set out to encourage and reward work. We are determined to help into work those who are unemployed and those who are outside the labour market, but who would like to find work. The Government have already taken significant steps to increase employment opportunity for all through the new deal programme to help people move from welfare to work and through measures to make work pay. More than 77,000 people have already participated in the various new deal programmes, and nearly 28,000 have moved on to jobs. The national minimum wage, introduced in April 1999, will benefit 100,000 workers in Scotland, and up to 2.5 million Scottish taxpayers will benefit from the 10p starting rate of income tax introduced in the last Budget. Around 2.2 million will benefit from the cut in the basic rate to 22p, which takes effect from tomorrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of that Budget 2000 introduces new action teams, which will help to match unemployed people to suitable vacancies in nearby labour markets. Scotland will benefit from two action teams, each receiving funding of £1.5 million. That comes on top of Scotland's employment zone which, from this month, will provide tailored help for around 4,500 long-term unemployed people. It extends and intensifies the new deal for those aged 25 and over from April 2001; provides a £100 job grant from spring 2001 to ease the transition from welfare to work; and extends the choices available to lone parents on income support so that, from April 2001, all lone parents on income support with children over 5 will be required to meet with a specialist personal adviser who will guide them through their choices—including help to try work, help to move into part-time or full-time work, and the opportunity to undertake education and training. That will help 62,000 lone parents in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also building stronger businesses. The Budget further promotes enterprise and job creation across all regions of the UK. More than 53,000 small and medium-sized businesses in Scotland will benefit from: further reforms to capital gains tax to strengthen the incentives for business investment—with a shortening of the business assets taper from 10 to 4 years and a reduction in the percentage thresholds for qualifying business asset shareholdings; permanent 40 per cent. first-year capital allowances; 100 per cent. first-year capital allowances for small firms investing in information and communications technology
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
equipment for the next three years; final details of the new enterprise management incentives scheme, the all-employee share ownership plan, the research and development tax credit and corporate venturing tax relief—all introduced from this month; and a new £1 billion target umbrella fund to help finance enterprise growth across all regions of the UK over three to five years. That scheme will significantly enhance access to early-stage venture capital for growth potential businesses across the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those measures will be of undoubted benefit both to individuals and businesses in Scotland. Many of them apply throughout the UK, but I wish to highlight several measures that will be of particular benefit to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport and transport costs are an important issue for rural and remote areas. Budget measures will not only help those people who live and work in rural areas, but will also encourage more visitors and provide a further boost to local economies. The Budget this year leaves road fuel duties unchanged in real terms; extends the reduced rate of vehicle excise duty to cars up to 1200cc from next March; helps the haulage industry through cuts in VED for many lorries and a freeze for most others; and introduces a new, fairer structure for air passenger duty. In particular, the duty on economy flights within the UK will be halved to £5 from November 2001 and all flights from the highlands and islands will be free from duty. With around 900,000 passengers using highlands and Islands airports each year, abolishing this charge will represent a significant boost for local economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has also recognised the importance to Scotland and the UK of the whisky industry in terms of employment and revenue—and no doubt in terms of pleasure and enjoyment. The Budget leaves the duty on spirits unchanged for the third year running. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hear a sedentary intervention from the Liberal Democrats saying that it should have been cut—no doubt to be paid for by yet another penny on income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We look forward to hearing from them how these cuts are to be paid for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is unambiguously good for Britain and good for Scotland. It builds on our achievement of economic stability and our record of job creation of the past three years, setting out the next stage of reforms that will boost enterprise, increase employment and deliver a fairer and more inclusive society. It provides a £2.4 billion boost to Scotland's public services, benefiting all 5.1 million residents of Scotland. It provides extra help for Scotland's 640,000 families with children, 920,000 pensioners, and 53,000 small and medium-sized businesses. That is a clear sign that the Labour Government are working hard for hard-working families. It means that by April 2001, personal tax and benefit changes under this and previous Budgets will have delivered an increase in the average household income in Scotland of more than £8.80 a week—more than £450 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Budget also demonstrates the benefit that Scotland gains within the UK from its stake in the larger UK economy. I might add that it also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
demonstrates one of the benefits that Scotland contributes to the UK, based on our traditions—I might even say our flair—for solid, prudent financial management, epitomised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish economy benefits directly from the Government's sound and stable management of the UK economy. Manufacturing output is growing in Scotland. Indeed, the Bank of Scotland's recent survey, reported in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on Monday, showed that output is rising strongly in both manufacturing and service sectors, and that it has been rising steadily for more than a year. Exports of manufacturing goods from Scotland are 8 per cent. last year. Employment in Scotland is up by 46,000 since spring 1997; and unemployment—especially youth unemployment and long-term unemployment—has been substantially cut. In short, the Scottish economy as a whole is in good shape under the Government's stewardship. Every individual in Scotland benefits. Step by step, we are building a better Scotland. The Budget will help to sustain and promote that goal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your strictures, Mr. Maxton, about statements using up time for debate later. However, this statement is important because it confirms what was missing from the Budget statement itself—any recognition or discussion of the problem faced by many sectors of the Scottish economy as a result of the high pound. The Secretary of State knows what is coming later, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in making his Budget statement, did not. He should have addressed the serious problems faced by many of our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The details, as the Secretary of State confirmed, are for the Scottish Parliament. However, in view of its role and funding within the United Kingdom, does he accept that the spending needs of the Scottish Parliament mean that the people of Scotland must take part in the debate here at Westminster about the balance between investment in public services and the desire for tax cuts? Despite the wishes of some political parties, the majority of Scottish people rejected the idea of varying income tax in Scotland, so does the Secretary of State agree that the solution to Scotland's finding problems is a UK-based debate on the future funding of public services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor makes great play of having brought an end to boom and bust in the economy, but does the Secretary of State recognise the serious problem of bust and boom in public services? The first years—the honeymoon period—of the new Labour Government saw cuts in public services, which are now being restored in the build-up to the next general election. Does the Secretary of State accept that that makes it difficult for people working in the health service and education to plan effectively for services in the future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State resist the siren calls for a tax guarantee and recognise that when a cyclical economy goes into downturn, cuts in public services are the last thing that we need? When unemployment is rising, cutting the welfare budget for pensioners—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
45 per cent. of the total welfare budget is being hit—is also regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Budget, the Chancellor put more money into tax cuts—a penny off income tax—than education. That sends out a serious message about the Government's lack of priority for education. At the end of their term, the chances are that they will still not have reached the percentage of GDP that was achieved by the Conservatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the overall settlement, will the Secretary of State assist those in local government to tackle the priorities they have to set by adopting a more open and honest stance, unlike the previous Government, and admit to local electorates that there have been real cuts in available resources? When those local councils go to the people to try to set priorities, they are working with resources that have been restricted by central Government. Will he help those local communities by being open and honest about that lack of resources? Will he also be vigilant in his own office to ensure that, since the Scottish block comes through his Department, as little as possible remains there and as much as possible reaches the cutting edge of the Scottish Executive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that the amount of public expenditure that goes to Scotland is a perfectly legitimate topic for discussion at Westminster. I have constantly maintained that the devolution settlement is a partnership of Parliaments. Some areas are reserved to Westminster and some are exclusively devolved, and in many there has to be a joint effort to ensure that the benefits to the people of Scotland are as great as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was slightly churlish. He might have congratulated me on going through a whole speech on the economy without mentioning boom and bust. I am glad that he raised it because he is right to remind us at every opportunity of the terrible legacy of economic instability that was vested in Scotland by the Conservatives and the stable economic framework that we have put in place. He mentioned the first two years. The people of Scotland do not want the traditional choice between expenditure on fairness, decency and social justice and the competent management of the economy. They want both competent economic management and the dispensation of the necessary resources to meet social need. That is what the Government have managed to combine in a historically legitimate and effective fashion It is precisely because we ran the economy competently with tight fiscal rules, ensuring that we were not profligate in our early days, that we are now able to dispense £2.4 billion extra in public expenditure to Scotland over the next few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned local government. The local government settlement is £2 billion more than was envisaged by the former Conservative Government. It is true that much of that is earmarked for one of the priorities, certainly of the Labour party and I believed also of the Liberal Democrats, which is education, education and education. When that is taken into account, there has been a massive extension in what we have provided to local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned pensioners. We have made sure that, step by step, as for everyone else, we are delivering for pensioners in Scotland. The poorest pensioners have a guaranteed income for the first time in history—an increase of over £10 per week. The oldest pensioners will have free TV licences. All pensioners now have a winter fuel allowance, which started at £10, was increased to £100 and is now to be increased to £150. They have all benefited from the cuts in VAT and from the restoration of the free eye tests, which were shamelessly abolished by the Conservatives. All that is in addition to a whole range of other measures from which pensioners benefit, not least the increase in the capital allowance that they are given before they lose benefits and the new reduced income tax starting rate which benefits many pensioners with modest savings. Furthermore, we are now consulting widely about how to tackle the problems of those pensioners with a small private pension, who often lose benefits as a result.

As the Secretary of State knows, Inverclyde is no longer the unemployment black spot that it was under the Tory regime. However, with reference to his comments on transport, it has been put to me that Railtrack is bedevilling the efforts of the Inverclyde council to redevelop the Gourock waterfront. Will he consult with the First Secretary and the council and use his good offices at national level to intervene to get this much-needed development under way? "Railtrack is playing funny buggers" was the expression used by my interlocutor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely sure that my hon. Friend is correct in saying that the minimum wage in Ireland is £4.40. It may be IR£4.40, which I believe is equivalent to about £3.70, but I would need to take advice on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite what the Secretary of State says about pensions, was he not disappointed, as some of his colleagues were, that the Chancellor did not take the opportunity to restore the link between pensions and earnings? Was he not also disappointed that petrol prices, which he said were so important to all of Scotland but in particular to rural Scotland, went up yet again? There has been a 25 per cent. rise in petrol prices since Labour came to power and they are 30 per
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
cent. higher than in the Republic of Ireland. Will he not concede that, since it was generally admitted that petrol prices were too high when the Chancellor stood up, even if he only put them up in line with inflation, they were still too high when he sat down?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may not be able to answer my final question right away but I should appreciate an answer in due course. If commercial flights begin from an airport in some rural part of Scotland other than the Highlands and Islands, will he consider extending the concession on airport passenger duty to those airports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first point, I shall not repeat the long list of benefits that we have introduced for pensioners. I would be the first to say—my colleagues will agree with me—that we have not done enough for pensioners. We can never do enough for pensioners. However, we have not done what the hon. Gentleman's party does, which is to promise everything to everybody. Any party that does that will deliver nothing to anybody ultimately. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman should be careful before making yet another spending pledge on behalf of the Scottish National party. There are cynics around who are already tabulating just how much the SNP would cost the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will know that no one has done more to try to tackle the problem of the differentials on petrol prices than my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Scotland Office, the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson). It would be churlish of him not to concede that, in getting rid of the automatic increase, the fuel duty escalator, the Chancellor listened to people in Scotland and did what we asked. Secondly, this year he effectively froze the tax on petrol in real terms. Thirdly, what matters is not only the price of petrol but the whole cost of motoring. The hon. Gentleman did not mention that many people's car tax is now almost 50 per cent. cheaper than it was previously; it has been reduced from £155 to £105, an undoubted benefit for many people in rural areas. We shall continue to do what we can for the elderly who are most in need and those in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about further extensions of APD; there are constant demands to extend every measure in every direction. The Chancellor listened to what people at the highlands and islands airports said about the deleterious effects of APD. I thought that the hon. Gentleman would have been happier that we abolished that duty, which will benefit more than 900,000 airport passengers, as I said earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend was right to draw the Committee's attention to the importance of a third-year freeze on the duty on whisky; I suspect that some 500 workers in the whisky packaging industry in my constituency drank the health of the Chancellor for the third year running.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The freeze on duty is important not just because of its effect on the consumption of whisky within the United Kingdom, but because it strengthens the industry's arm in arguments about tax and duty

discrimination throughout the world. In 1999, the industry was so successful in persuading the Taiwanese and Swiss Governments to reform their duty on Scotch whisky that whisky exports to Switzerland went up by 62 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my right hon. Friend constantly to remind the Chancellor of the link between tax duties on whisky in this country and the industry's attempts to reduce discrimination elsewhere. The industry will turn its attention this year to South Korea and to Chile next year and I hope that my hon. Friend will keep up the pressure on the Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that the Chancellor is aware of the matter but I shall, of course, remind him about it. My hon. Friend raises an important point: it is not just a matter of taxation on whisky and the spirits industry in this country but in other regions. I am glad to hear that workers in his constituency were moved to drink the Chancellor's health for the third year running. They were joined in that celebration by Labour party members and millions of others throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State acknowledge that people in Scotland are puzzled about why the fuel price increase is 3.1 per cent., substantially more than the rate of inflation, but pensions will go up by only 1.1 per cent.? Seventy-five pence does not cover the cost of a litre of petrol anywhere in Scotland, and that is what most pensioners will have to use to get to their nearest cash point when those in their locality close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is wrong with raising the basic pension and giving pensioners a choice, rather than the Government choosing what pensions should be spent on? The Chancellor had a windfall in VAT revenues on the back of the increased price of oil, which he could have used to help pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) was right about the link between the tax base here and negotiations abroad. He knows that the industry is lobbying for a reduction in tax and, although the Secretary of State says that there is a cost, there is ample evidence in the House of Commons Library that a cut in duty on home-sold whisky would increase the Chancellor's revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there is a set mechanism for increasing the basic pension, which is related, among other things, to mortgages. The circumstances of the last increase meant that it was small because inflation was low. The next time round, the increase for an individual pensioner is likely to be between £2 and £3 and will be more than £3 for a couple. I repeat what I said earlier: it is not the only thing that the Government have done for pensioners. We have restored the free eye test, cut VAT and introduced a £150 fuel allowance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all got VAT cuts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said, "We all got VAT cuts," as if that means that it does not benefit pensioners. Pensioners got not only VAT cuts but a £150 fuel allowance and free eye tests, which the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Gentleman did not get. They also have free television licences; as far as I am aware, the hon. Gentleman did not get that. The Government have introduced a range of measures for pensioners and we will continue to do so. The hon. Gentleman asks why we did not distribute the money widely and give it to all pensioners. He may not agree with what we have done but we tried to distribute the money to everyone over a certain age and to target some of it on the poorest pensioners, who have only a state pension. They had an increase of more than £10 a week. We targeted some of the money on the oldest pensioners because although we want all pensioners to benefit we wanted to give particular help to those most in need. Those are the sort of decent, fair measures that a Labour Government are expected to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I answered the question about the fuel duty escalator posed by the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan). The hon. Gentleman has a cheek to condemn the Government for stopping the fuel duty escalator and freezing prices when his party's policy is to add 5p a litre to fuel. He did not share with a wider Scottish audience that he wanted another 5p on fuel, on top of anything that the Tories added, and he should have been honest enough to admit it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does my right hon. Friend agree that in years to come, parents will tell their children stories about Rapunzel, the three pigs, and the Liberal Democrat's magic penny and all the things they did with it? Let us take them down to reality; this is a good Budget, which put an extra £300 million in the Scottish coffers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrat spokesman mentioned education. I have visited 15 schools in my constituency since the Budget and every head teacher congratulated me on the bounty of £3,000 to £60,000 that will go directly into their schools' coffers. The Government are delivering what they promised on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind my right hon. Friend that unemployment in west Dumbartonshire in my constituency, is at the second highest level in Scotland. A whisky company in my constituency, J & B, closed last year and I am working with the company, and the enterprise council to start a task force. The Secretary of State has been helpful in that respect, but I ask him for further assistance to ensure that national training initiative schemes in retail and catering are brought to Dumbarton and to discuss the matter with the First Minister. I hope that in future, there will be double the number of jobs that were lost in Dumbarton in the past year or so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that we have made a significant dent—over 55 per cent. in the most conservative estimate and up to 69 per cent.—in youth unemployment, especially in Scotland, since the Government took office. Unemployment in Scotland is the lowest for about 24 years—it is a record low—and employment is at its highest at 2.3 million. Nevertheless, I accept that there are areas where unemployment is higher than average and we must do

what we can about it. I hope to have an opportunity to discuss unemployment in my hon. Friend's constituency with the First Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend about schools. We have given a massive boost to the national health service, and to education, in which Scotland traditionally takes pride. The money granted to education will go to front-line services in schools, which everyone warmly welcomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend's comment about the Liberal Democrat's penny. The people who gave us the single transferable vote have now given us the single transferable penny. The Liberal Democrat's promise to deliver everything that is desired, all by means of the same penny, which goes from portfolio to portfolio. They may like to tell us that it is not a single transferable penny and that all the pennies that they have mentioned on education, health and crime are additional pennies. We are talking about a 5p or 10p increase and they will doubtless wish to clarify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is important to address the one issue that was not mentioned at all in the Budget: the exchange rate. It is quite extraordinary for any Chancellor giving an overview of the performance of the economy, not even to mention it in passing. It is especially astonishing not to mention an exchange rate that is causing significant sectors of the Scottish economy a great deal of pain and anxiety. It is perhaps typical of the Government that they paint a big picture, but ignore the details that are causing the most distress and discomfort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish economy is particularly affected by the strength of the pound. It affects our farming and food, our tourism, our manufacturing and our exporting base, which are disproportionately significant to the Scottish economy. It is also worth noting that, against that background, we have an astonishing rise in the balance of payments deficit to which, again, the Chancellor made no reference. It was just under £13 billion in 1999 as against under £1 billion the previous year. Lord Desai, one of the gurus of the Government's economic team, said that that was not a problem; the balance of payments is not relevant to the exchange rate any more apparently, it is capital movements that count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the markets will take a different view if that deficit continues to increase. The general response from business was one of concern or even alarm that the Chancellor seemed to be totally unconcerned about the problem. The chief economist
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
of the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, Mr. Iain Duff, said:
	<br><q><p>There is nothing we could latch on to as the saviour of manufacturing. This is a positive Budget, but the Chancellor could have been more generous.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He hit out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Scottish Engineering, which has 400 members, criticised the Chancellor for being an illusionist. Its chief executive said:
	<br><q><p>The Chancellor has used smoke and mirrors to obscure the lack of meaningful immediate support for the manufacturing engineering sector.</p></q>
The Confederation of British Industry made similar comments. It said:
	<br><q><p>This is not the budget for business that we were hoping for.</p></q>
Those real concerns are being ignored by the Chancellor and the Government. But that is just the general background. Let us look at the specifics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farming accounts for about twice the proportion of the Scottish economy as compared with the overall UK economy. Scottish agriculture is highly dependent on the support system that has been built up in the common agricultural policy because 90 per cent. of our land is less favoured. The problem is that the Government have not played fair with Scottish farming over the last few years. It is worth recalling that, at the time of the Fontainebleau agreement, Mrs. Thatcher's Government negotiated a reduction in the British contribution to the total EU budget, especially on the basis of agricultural compensation, which has saved between £1.5 billion and £2 billion a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was rather like negotiating a reduced insurance premium in exchange for agreeing to a higher excess on any claim. That is essentially what has happened. But when agriculture makes a claim, the Government, who benefited from the reduced insurance premium, have not been prepared to pass on the full benefit of the claim that has been made by Scottish farmers. The Government argue that, under the Fontainebleau agreement, they must pay 85.5 per cent. of the compensation that is allowed for the exchange rate effect, compared with 50 per cent. in other EU countries. That is a problem for the Government. No one can deny that, but it is not a problem of the farmers' making. Because the Government are not prepared to put that up in full, our farmers have had to suffer the most drastic fall in their incomes in memory and a reduction in subsidies across the board making it impossible for many of them to survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still working through the details of the announcement from the summit that was held last week, but the farming commentators to whom I have spoken since then tell me that, while any money is welcome when an industry is in crisis, the Government should not expect the farming industry to regard the hand-out of about a quarter of their entitlement as some form of salvation. It is a late contribution of money to which the farmers were entitled, not paid in full, at a time when the industry is in severe crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
I wonder whether the Government presume that, because agriculture represents a relatively small proportion of the total employment and the total economy, it is possible to bamboozle the majority of people who do not know about agriculture and do not understand its importance to the rural economy, which is a large part of Scotland. Do they believe that by plucking figures out of the air and giving headlines of how much money is being given, they will be seen as saving an industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee would be interested to know the Liberal Democrat headline figure for how much more money is to be given to the farmers. He said that it was a quarter of what they were due. Is that a policy statement that the Liberal Democrats would spend four times as much on further agricultural subsidies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats have consistently said that the full agrimoney compensation to which farming is entitled should have been paid and should be a commitment by the Government. The Government are withholding money to which farmers understandably feel that they are entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for showing his customary courtesy in giving way to me. We all have great sympathy for hill, tenant and small farmers, but may I remind him that 80 per cent. of the subsidies under the common agricultural policy go to 20 per cent. of farmers, many of whom are not short of a bob or two. I would expect him to say at least a word or two about the need for the comprehensive reform of the CAP both in terms of the needs of his farmers and the enlargement of the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of Scottish agriculture, that intervention is a red herring. I am not against reform of the CAP, but is it a European policy? The British Government should not talk as if they could reform it unilaterally or use it as an excuse for not allowing Scottish and British farmers to benefit under the existing arrangements. His specific points about the benefits that some rich farmers are receiving apply to few farmers in Scotland because 90 per cent. of our farmers operate on less-favoured land. The big problem, as he knows, is that it is mostly large arable farmers in the east of England who have benefited from the CAP.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hence the need for reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may justify a case for reform, but it does not justify withholding the money from the farmers in Scotland who are currently facing the crisis. That is the essential point. Furthermore—this is relevant to the strength of the pound—apart from the compensation in subsidies and the fact that those are based in euros, an appreciation in the pound of 34 per cent. over the last five years against continental currencies means that sustaining export markets for British producers is extremely difficult. Cheap imports are flooding in and undermining the home market. Labelling is important, but although the housewife would like to know what she is buying and to be able to make a choice, if an imported product is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
significantly cheaper, inevitably many will buy it. The pig sector in particular has been in crisis. It is totally unsupported and therefore does not benefit from agricultural subsidies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to finish this point. Over the past two years the Scottish pig herd has decline from 74,000 sows to 50,000. The price differential between the production of pigs in this country and in Denmark—one of our major competitors—is 24 per cent. That is an enormous disadvantage for a Scottish producer to withstand and most of them have not been able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with interest to the hon. Gentleman complaining about the strength of the pound. It is one of the problems of success that people value our currency highly. The logic of what he is saying is that he wants to devalue the pound in some way. I should like to hear the Liberal Democrat policy for doing that. How would he lower the value of the pound? That is what the debate is about. What are his policies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I must explain to the Committee the impact of the pound on the most exposed sectors of the Scottish economy. I shall be more than happy to answer the hon. Gentleman's question, indeed, he might know part of the answer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. It is important that I should be allowed to develop this argument.

The point has now been reached where only 15 per cent. of employment in Scotland is in manufacturing, which has been particularly hard hit by the consequences of the high pound. There have been spectacular examples in England in the motor industry, but in Scotland many small adjustments lead to a loss of jobs across the board. In manufacturing as a whole last year we lost 130,000 jobs across the UK. Scotland, because the base is smaller, probably lost fewer, but we saw, for example, Marks and Spencer, a company that once prided itself that 99 per cent. of its products were made in Britain, pulling out of manufacturing here and buying cheaper abroad to take advantage of the exchange rate. As a direct consequence there have been hundreds of redundancies in companies such as Dax Simpson. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] How can it be a fantasy? Dax Simpson, which employs 1,300 people, has said that there could be 628 redundancies as a result of the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have a quote here from the Minister of State, Scotland Office, who pays tribute to the Daks staff, said
	<br><q><p>It was a cruel blow.</p></q>
The reason for those losses is that Marks and Spencer has taken advantage of the strength of the pound and the weakness of their own trading position to buy abroad. That is costing jobs in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know quite a lot about Daks Simpson.

Many Scottish manufacturing companies are shedding labour at the moment because they are finding it difficult to maintain their competitive edge. That is not simply my analysis, but that of the Scottish Trades Union Congress. The STUC previously had a good dialogue with the Labour party and it has expressed its concern at the state of manufacturing and the impact of the strength of the pound as being the single most difficult factor facing manufacturing industry in Scotland. If members of the Government say that it is not a problem, I am right to suggest that before a solution can be reached they need to be persuaded that it is.

Another important sector of the Scottish economy is tourism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman take an intervention from a Back Bencher?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful and feel privileged to be the only Back Bencher that has been allowed to intervene. The hon. Gentleman seems to have missed the point that the manufacture of clothing uses raw materials from abroad so it benefits massively from the exchange rate and the buying power of the pound. Therefore, it is not the exchange rate that is causing problems. I have lost 700 jobs in the manufacture of clothing, but the cost of raw materials has cut their prices massively. They simply cannot cut the wage rates to the level of those in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Taiwan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument then presumably is that we have to let those jobs go. Much of our textile industry is nevertheless still trying to add value. A domestic industry benefits, of course; but where an industry is trying to re-export, it still faces considerable difficulties. Scotland prides itself on being an exporting country and on the extent to which it trades. To suggest that that does not therefore make the exchange rate important is astonishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen a crisis in farming, real difficulties in manufacturing and it is obvious that the tourism industry is also suffering. The Scottish tourist board has already mounted a campaign to encourage Scots to take a holiday at home because we are losing out on foreign visitors and because the strength of the pound, as has already been said, encourages Scots to take cheap foreign holidays rather than stay at home. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] This is the tourist board's analysis, not mine. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Sottish tourist board is extremely concerned at our inability to sustain the level of tourism spending in Scotland on which so many of our jobs depend. I am astonished that Labour Members cannot understand that the ability to buy cheap holidays abroad encourages people to go abroad and that the high cost of holidays in the United Kingdom discourages foreign visitors. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] No one will stop people going abroad. I am astonished at the mood and tenor of Labour Members' response, because I had thought that the analysis of the facts could not be disputed. I thought that we might disagree about what should be

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just a minute. I welcome the fact that the Chancellor did not increase the duty on whisky. As the Secretary of State said in his opening speech, that recognises the industry's role, but he will know that the Scotch Whisky Association has said that the strength of the pound is having a serious effect on Scotch whisky exports—always a difficult, but important, market for us. The whisky industry argues that the duty on whisky should be reduced for two reasons. First, it would show foreign Governments who put discriminatory taxes on whisky that it is more fairly taxed at home. The French clearly understand that home-produced alcohol products should benefit from lower taxation. It is astonishing that, in effect, the Government give an advantage to imported wine and disadvantage our main home-produced product—whisky.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish the argument before allowing the hon. Gentleman to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefit of reducing duty at home is that it would increase the home market, which would help the industry's overall viability and competitiveness. The Secretary of State teased me, perhaps understandably, by saying that if we cut the duty, we would have to explain how to offset the revenue lost. The truth is that the elasticity of demand for whisky is such that a cut in duty does not cause a drop in revenue. Indeed, such a cut can sometimes increase revenue; it is not a significant revenue factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a direct constituency interest in maintaining some of those arguments at the forefront of the economic debate in Scotland, so I shall not detract from them. The hon. Gentleman chastised my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for ignoring the details and talking about the big picture. Will he refer to the fact that this year's Scotch whisky exports broke the £2 billion barrier for the seventh year in a row—a fact that the Scotch whisky industry celebrated? Will he refer to Scotland's GDP growth
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
figures or to the fact that the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, which he has already prayed in aid, has stated that United Kingdom manufacturing output—and Scottish manufacturing output—has continued to grow under this Government's management of the economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have a chance to make his own speech. He says that the whisky industry celebrated the fact that exports broke the £2 billion barrier for the seventh year in a row, but it did so by £1 million this year, which represents a decrease of £29 million on the previous year. It might be true that the industry broke the £2 billion barrier, but the trend is in the wrong direction, hence the headline in the business section of The 	<i>Herald,</i> "Hangover for the whisky industry".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given way to the hon. Gentleman. I, too, have a copy of the press release. He agrees with that analysis and knows that the problem exists, but he does not want to face the fact that the whisky industry is having a hard time partly because the pound's exchange rate is extremely high in many of its markets compared with that of the past two or three years. It is true that the exchange rate has not altered significantly in two of the top four destinations for whisky exports—the United States and Japan—but the industry acknowledges that there is a real difficulty in the second and third most important markets, Spain and France.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can make his own speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crunch for Scotland is that we export predominantly to the European Union. Seven of the top 10 countries to which we export are in the EU, and the exchange rate in all of them has adjusted by 34 per cent. in the past four or five years. Labour Members are not living in the real world if they do not think that that is a problem for significant sectors of the Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of not being accused of sex discrimination, will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a nice try.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to answer the basic question. Our analysis is simple: a significant chunk of the Scottish economy is suffering from the pound's high, historically above average, exchange rate. What action should be taken by the Chancellor, who did not think that fact important enough to mention in his Budget statement? It is obviously not appropriate to change the workings of the Monetary Policy Committee, but having given the Bank of England its remit, the Government have a responsibility to acknowledge the distortions that arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could pursue a strategy that will help to produce convergence between the pound and the currencies of our major competitors or trading partners. They could identify the sectors that are particularly adversely affected and decide either not to increase the burdens on them—such a decision was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
taken on Scotch whisky—or to reduce the burdens, especially those on whisky and farming. That would be well within the Government's control and responsibilities, but they are either failing to act or doing so only partially. The Government should show some concern and interest, and take that action. That is what the sectors most affected by the problem are requesting, but they hear no answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the fact that the hon. Gentleman has given way, although it has taken some time. If what he says is the case, how does he explain that Traditional Weatherwear, a high-quality company in my constituency that was much lauded at the recent Paris fashion week, during which the Prime Minister's wife tried on one of its garments, took on 15 people for modern apprenticeships last year? It is a growing manufacturing company that exports throughout the world. Is it not true that people benefit from a stable economy with good jobs and high employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely pleased that the hon. Lady has a success story to tell. Of course, there are success stories in the economy and in my constituency, but that does not belie the fact that an underlying problem exists. Good management will respond, but sometimes it does so by manufacturing or buying outside the Scottish economy. The Government must acknowledge that those problems arise and that, if the drift continues, the consequent loss of investment and jobs will be substantial. When the Governor of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee are asked to comment on the exchange rate of the pound, their response is, "Our job, fundamentally, is to achieve an inflation target, and the exchange rate is an incidental calculation within it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a proper response from the Monetary Policy Committee, but not from the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. They have a responsibility to tell people what they expect over the next two to three years. The Governor of the Bank of England says that he does not know why the euro is low and the pound high or when that will change. He can offer no comfort, yet the Government will give neither sectoral assistance in terms that we have identified nor pursue a policy of trying to achieve a degree of convergence to bring the pound, not necessarily back to its former level, but to one that most people would regard as more realistic, and reduce interest rates to a more desirable level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deliberately, the debate is not about the entry of the United Kingdom into the euro. Whether one is for or against it, one still has to deal in the meantime with the problem of the exchange rate. It remains the view of Liberal Democrats that a clear statement from the Government of an intention to join, coupled with policies designed to achieve a degree of convergence, would give a clear steer to the markets that would help to bring down the pound and ease the strain. The Government have failed—and refused—to do that, and, we argue, have aggravated the problem. They are also not addressing the problems of specific sectors.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
They could deal with those that the whisky industry is asking them to address and with farming issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. Wittingly or unwittingly, the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order, but a matter for debate. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to catch my eye, he may try to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) clearly thinks that the exchange rate is fine. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] He specifically said that the current exchange rate was a mark of success. It is a mark of distortion within the market and also a mark of unfair discrimination for some sectors of the economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have made it clear that the Government may take action to help the sectors that are most adversely affected. I identified the action. If hon. Gentlemen do not like it, it was a clear articulation of policy. Secondly, the Government could end their dithering over whether to join the euro and come to a clear decision of intent. They could say, "We intend to join", not, "We shall join if it is in the national interest when we decide what that is."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, significant sectors of the Scottish economy are left with no steer or guide, and, to some extent, no hope. Both those clear statements of policy are within the control of the Government, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, and they conspicuously refuse to follow them. It is reasonable therefore to conclude that the problems caused by the instability to tourism, to manufacturing and to the food and whisky and agriculture industries are responsibilities that the Government could deal with, but have conspicuously failed to address. The people of Scotland should know that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To describe what we have just heard as a saloon-bar analysis of the Scottish economy would be to do a grave disservice to the patrons of saloon bars. I was disappointed in what we heard, not least because of its ungracious failure to recognise the present success of the Scottish economy and of Scottish exporters. There was not a word about that. By all means let us discuss difficulties and how to improve matters furthers, but there should be some recognition of the strength of the Scottish economy and the positive outlook for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman devoted his whole speech to the European dimension of the exchange rate. To listen to him, one would think that gloom was everywhere in the Scottish economy and exports were collapsing around our ears. Let me cite the figures. Between 1996 and 1998, despite exchange rate difficulties in Europe, Scottish exports to the European Union rose substantially, from £10.756 billion to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
£12.139 billion, at exactly the time that we have been wasting the last half an hour describing as a bleak desert of economic despair for every company in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a commitment to sit down after 10 minutes, because I do not want to monopolise all the good news that there is to tell about the Scottish economy and many of my hon. Friends wish to join in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene, whereas the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) did not. He mentioned the Governor of the Bank of England and said that the MPC thought that the exchange rate was incidental. I attended a dinner in Glasgow with the Governor of the Bank of England. He said that stable economic policy was extremely important. In the past few years he had not recognised Scotland: it had less unemployment, more growth and the lowest inflation possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman did those comments a disservice. Does my hon. Friend agree that it was a vacuous presentation? We still do not know what the Liberal Democrats will do. Will they intervene and distort the market? If so, he can see from the example of Japan, which intervened last year and shored up its exchange rate by £60 billion, that the level of the yen went up by 18 per cent. It is a failed policy. Will the hon. Gentleman try to get out of the Liberal Democrats what they intend to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The happy reality of debating with the Liberal Democrats is that one never finds out what they intend to do.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even a year ago, there was much economic gloom—not because of what had gone on in Scotland, but because of the financial turmoil in south-east Asia. Scotland and the United Kingdom were seen as especially vulnerable, given their extensive overseas trade and investment links. The performance of the Scottish economy has confounded last year's pessimism, and in many respects Scotland has surpassed last year's expectations of even the most optimistic commentators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I work closely with many exporting companies and continue to travel abroad to support their efforts. Contrary to what the hon. Gentleman suggested, Scotland has many wonderful products and services to sell to the world, and it is vital that our exporters continue to be backed by the strength of the export promotion effort in every corner of the world to help to maximise their potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will mention a few of our recent export successes. I was in Egypt recently with Terex, which is in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Terex has won a £3.5 million order to supply 15 specialist trucks to the General Nile Company in Cairo. In textiles, Kinloch Anderson has secured a partnership agreement with a company in Korea—a market that is now coming back—that is worth £6 million over three years. The Aberdeen software house, F1 Compliance Software, is completing a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
£1.2 million deal with Monsanto. These are random, recent examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bounce-back of the cashmere industry in the Borders and also at Johnston of Elgin, which I recently had the pleasure of visiting, is another good news story in which I thought Liberal Democrat Members were especially interested. Again, there was no mention of them in the hon. Gentleman's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a word about Daks because it is an absurd misrepresentation to suggest that what is happening at Daks is the Government's fault. No one in Daks would take that view. Only yesterday I received a letter from the chairman of Daks expressing appreciation of the efforts that the Government had made to support it. The tragedy at Larkhall and Polbeth occurred because Marks and Spencer had withdrawn a contract. I do not denigrate Marks and Spencer, as some people do. One has to remember that it still sells a higher proportion of United Kingdom manufactured goods than any of its competitors. It is in Marks and Spencer's interests to sell more UK-manufactured goods, because part of the problem that is afflicting it is that it is losing its image as a company that sells exclusively UK goods. It is taking work to lower-wage economies, and we cannot compete on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line with the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna), Daks-Simpson has not sat back and said, "This is a disaster." It has gone out selling and obtaining contracts at home and abroad. It has not accepted that the situation is hopeless or that the analysis made by the hon. Member for Gordon is correct. It will not fill the gap left by the Marks and Spencer order, but it is having a good try. It is the responsibility of every member of the Committee to give Daks-Simpson and similar companies every encouragement not to look for cheap political pickings on the basis of an absurd analysis of the difficulties that they face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He has been involved in various issues in that regard. Will he acknowledge that the industry's problems last year were to do with the banana war and world trade disputes, rather than the exchange rate? Will he recognise that the industry is anxious this year about how the multi-fibre arrangement will develop? The Minister has met George Peden, the chairman of the Scottish Cashmere Producers Association. Will he admit that he would find it hard to say that the high exchange rate had not been mentioned in those meetings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the high exchange rate has been mentioned in respect of European markets, to which I shall return. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) said, cashmere is not produced in the Borders. Cashmere knitwear is produced there, but the raw material comes from China. The high exchange rate is an advantage, not a disadvantage as regards importing the raw material. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] They cannot have their cashmere and eat it. Everyone understands that if

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
there is a problem in one regard, there is a benefit in the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to cashmere later, but I want to put the strength of the pound in proper perspective. It is important to note that our exports to the EU have not fallen, but have continued to rise. I am even more pleased to say that Scottish exports as a whole rose by nearly 8 per cent. in real terms in the year to last September—not exactly a symptom of terminal decline. To put the strength of the pound into its proper perspective, we must remember that not all Scottish companies trade only in Europe; some also trade with other parts of the world. The pound is strong exclusively against the euro. Conversely—the Liberal Democrats choose not to go into this too deeply—the euro is weak against the pound. In the EU, sterling is 13 per cent. higher than it was in 1996 and almost 15 per cent. higher than it was in May 1997—that is the reality. It has created challenges for our exporting companies and has made them more competitive. To an admirable extent, those companies have been able to overcome the challenges. The benefits of competitiveness, which companies have built into their systems, will give them an even greater advantage when the currencies converge to an extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider other currencies. The yen is almost back to its 1996 level in relation to the pound and it is 10 per cent. below where it was in May 1997. The value of sterling against the dollar has changed little since the general election. The picture is, therefore, much more complex than the comments by the hon. Member for Gordon would suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial for exporters and the economy as a whole to have a stable and competitive pound. We know that what exporters fear most is a return to the boom and bust instability of the past. The exporters to whom I constantly speak agree that the most important thing is to continue to deliver a stable economic environment with sustained growth, low inflation and sound public finances to enable them to plan and invest with confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the start, I will keep my comments brief because it is more important that hon. Members have an opportunity to contribute. I will be able to speak at the end. However, there is a danger of talking down our exporters' achievements by talking up the problems created by sterling's strength against the euro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have participated in many sittings of this Committee in the past 10 years, and that is exactly what Conservative Ministers told Labour spokesmen. It is the Opposition's duty to identify problems, and the Government's—perhaps—to promote success. Of course, we want success. However, the Minister has merely identified successes and not addressed the problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is not true I freely recognise the problem that the pound's strength creates for exporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several criticisms of the Liberal Democrat party and the hon. Gentleman, who fails to recognise
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
exporters' achievement in overcoming such problems and the wider picture beyond the relationship with the euro. Above all, he has failed to say what he would do to achieve the parity that he wants with the euro. We need far more exporting companies in Scotland, and most damaging of all is the message that the hon. Gentleman is sending potential exporters that it is inherently impossible to export to the European Union at present
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not true. Many companies are exporting extremely successfully and there is an overall increase in our exports to Europe and the rest of the world: we want to build on those successes. Naturally, exporting companies that I meet are anxious about the pound's strength, but few say that it has such an apocalyptic effect that they are giving up exporting and getting out of business. They have managed to become more competitive, which fuels the engine for growth in exporting and of the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being complacent or pretending that there are no problems, which would be deeply insulting to companies that have confronted such problems. However, we should recognise that the balance of the story is positive and work with Scotland's exporters to do even better in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank Liberal Democrat Members for choosing this topic. Without doubt, sterling's exchange rate is damaging the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was going to ask the Secretary of State's opinion on the matter, but I think that the Minister may have provided an answer. However, I would like to know whether the pound is over-valued or is set at a reasonable level. If the Secretary of State thinks that it is over-valued, what representations has he made to the Chancellor? Does the Secretary of State accept the International Monetary Fund's opinion in its January report that the pound would have to fall by more than 20 per cent. against the euro before the UK can sign up to the single currency? Are the Government going to do anything about the value of sterling?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The signs are that the Government are unwilling to do anything about sterling. Indeed, the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) mentioned the absence of any reference to the matter in the Budget statement. I am convinced that the strong pound is putting our businesses at a competitive disadvantage in comparison with our European neighbours. Manufacturers compete with lower-price imports from the rest of Europe and are up against the price transparency offered by being in the eurozone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the evidence. Since the general election, 22,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Scotland. Since 1996, the pound has appreciated against the euro by 35 per cent., although I accept that some of that took place when the present Government were not in office. It is at its highest level for 14 years and is having a severe effect on manufacturing, agriculture, tourism and exports.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Begg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the driving force of the Scottish economy is outwith Scotland, it has resulted in the lowest level of unemployment for 25 years, the highest level of employment for 33 years and a stable economy.

Of course, the gap is widening, and those rates—which were nearly the same in 1997—now show a significant difference. Unemployment rates are falling far more rapidly in England than in Scotland. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Either the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) thinks that the policy is geared to south-east England, or she does not.

The Labour party may believe that a strong currency is an international endorsement of its achievements in office.

Scotland's is a small economy and we depend on foreign investors, manufacturing, exports and tourism. We are therefore more susceptible to rising exchange rates than the rest of the United Kingdom. Sixty per cent. of our manufactured exports are with the eurozone. We must therefore be outward-looking and position ourselves to perform in an increasingly competitive market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An over-valued pound has consequences for inward investment. Locate in Scotland's figures show that the amount of inward investment has fallen in comparison with previous years.

We need only examine recent newspaper reports highlighting the concerns of overseas investors. Yesterday, the 	<i>Financial Times</i> reported that Japanese investors were reconsidering future investments in the UK because of the sustained overvaluation of the pound against the euro and little or no progress by the Government on entering the single currency.

In recent years, the UK has attracted approximately 40 per cent. of total European Union direct investment, with Scotland getting about 20 per cent. of those projects and almost 12 per cent. of new unemployment. But an overvalued currency, together with transaction costs that we have not faced elsewhere in the eurozone, means that these investors could pack up and leave just as fast as they arrive, or that new investors could choose to locate in the single currency area. All those factors, put together, clearly cost us those 22,000 jobs in the past three years. Lower inward investment means less job creation for the future, and pressure on exporters to compete with cheaper importers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of those job losses were in our traditional industries. For example, six workers were made redundant at British Steel's two plants in Motherwell and Cambuslang. The company cited the reason thus:
	<br><q><p>Over the past year the market has been affected by adverse trading conditions and the sustained strength of sterling together with increased competition.</p></q>
The hon. Member for Gordon rightly mentioned the problem that the tourism industry faces. It will not go unnoticed that, while those problems were being recited, there was laughter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who's laughing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Gordon relating to the tourism industry's problems, there was nothing but laughter and amusement from the Labour Benches. That will not go unnoticed in what is a vital industry for Scotland. These issues must be addressed and a solution sought. All parties here agree that the way forward is the single currency for Scotland, although obviously other parties will review that in a UK context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Begg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) said that the SNP's policy is to take Scotland into the single currency. I assume, then, that the SNP would like the pound to drop to that level. If that is so, would not the result be an unstable economy, and would not that be disastrous for Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That rather depends on the level of the UK currency when Scotland becomes independent and on whether the UK is a member of the single currency at the time. I should be delighted to hear something from the Government about that. Any analysis of the eurozone and Scotland's economy would demonstrate that the prospects of greater stability and more appropriate policy are greater within the EU currency than under the current regime of UK decision making. While Ireland, Portugal and Finland—all small European countries on the periphery of Europe—benefit from an exchange rate irrevocably fixed to the core of Europe and the secure low-interest regime of the European Central Bank, with Greece and Denmark ready to follow within a year, we are set to remain on the outside and will have to continue to work harder to compete with

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say more about the single currency; the hon. Gentleman can intervene then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP believes that the optimal position for Scotland would be to enter the euro as an independent nation on a par with other member states. We recognise that only an independent Scotland can reap fully the benefits of euro membership. Scotland needs full representation in all the EU's institutions, including the European Central Bank and ECOFIN. We need to have a say in that decision-making process, in a way that we do not in the United Kingdom. The fact that Scottish interests are not being considered in the formulation of monetary policy was evident when Eddie George made his famous quote in October 1998 that unemployment in the north was a price worth paying for low inflation in the south.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Scotland joined the single currency, the Scottish economy would thrive against a background of low interest rates and a stable exchange rate, and we would have unfettered access to a market six times larger than that of the United Kingdom. The other benefits are well known and, in the main, we agree on them. They include the elimination of transaction costs and currency risks associated with foreign trade, lower interest rates and access to a greater export market. I hope that we all recognise that the key to trade is placing business at the best competitive advantage, and being part of the single currency area is surely a way of achieving that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) is anxious to speak. Adapting to the habits of two Chambers is proving exceptionally difficult. We need to focus on how to achieve membership. Current constitutional arrangements dictate that Scotland has to wait until the UK meets the five economic criteria set by the Treasury and commits to the single currency. Will the Minister tell us whether than can be achieved within the Government's preferred time scale of 2002–03? Will he also say whether he is satisfied with the progress of Britain's preparation for membership of the euro because the great uncertainty about the Government's intentions is slowing progress? Action is needed to bring the UK economy into line with the rest of Europe if the Government are to succeed in their referendum. We must remove Scotland from the sterling straitjacket that the Government have imposed on us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Gordon) on his party's behalf. We have heard two detailed speeches that were devoid of any mention of what the Liberal Democrats' or the SNP's respective exchange rate policies are. It would be easy for Labour members of the Committee to figure a set of circumstances where totally benign economic factors were in place and growth in Scotland was where we want it to be. The debate is supposed to be about Scotland's economy and how we get to that scenario in terms of the strength of the pound, but the SNP and the Liberal Democrats have made no suggestion about how we achieve that proper relationship with the euro zone currencies that we all want. In a debate instigated by Opposition parties, it is no good just saying, "You are the Government so it is up to you to come up with a solution."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that since my election, the Scottish National party has taken part in two election campaigns with differing economic policies for Scotland. One had an agenda and manifesto that showed the Scottish economy with a massive surplus; the second, which was a couple of years later, showed the economy for the same year with a massive deficit. During the latter election campaign, the party's exchange rate policy required the Scottish pound that would figure in an independent Scotland to be tied directly to sterling, and to follow it. One can understand the reluctance of the SNP to articulate at this stage a third policy on exchange rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that I was trying to get to that position by asking the Government about their intentions? Like it or not, we are in the UK now, and I should like to know what position we shall be in after the next general election and referendum. Will we be in the euro, or in the middle of a referendum on the euro?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Scottish economy and that of the UK continue to improve and the stability of the past three years continues, I suspect that Scotland will be firmly part of the UK after the next general election, with the Labour Government in control and building on the policies that have achieved the successes that we are now enjoying. [HON. MEMBERS: It says here.] I wish that I had written that. We need to have a balanced debate. It would be naive and disingenuous of me to deny that concerns have been expressed by my constituents. I carried out a quick telephone survey—I am sure that the Liberal Democrats appreciate the advantages of quick telephone surveys—of some of the major manufacturing and exporting employers in my constituency and as one would expect, the strength of sterling has put considerable pressure on those sectors. By no stretch of the imagination is the issue as straightforward as it is sometimes painted. I will share with the Committee some of the comments that were made to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a firm in my constituency called Glacien Vandervuell that makes thin-wall engine bearings for the automotive industry; there is hardly a Ford motor car in Europe that does not have a thin-wall engine bearing made in Kilmarnock. It is, therefore, an important employer, which has been seriously affected because most of its product goes abroad and much of it to Europe. BMW, in fact, is one of its major
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
customers. People in Glacien Vandervuell say that the pound has appreciated by 16 per cent. since last January in relation to their European markets. That means that long-term contracts that the firm has with BMW, which it is locked into and cannot come out of, are hurting it severely because of the substantial up-front costs of design and tooling. When I make representations on behalf of such firms to Ministers, they clearly know about and understand those problems, because there are people in their constituencies who have the same problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a water engineering business in my constituency called Glenfield and Kennedy, whose managing director uses language that is as blunt as that used by some of my hon. Friends' constituents. He told me one or two things about his situation. His simple solution is that we must get tied to the euro as soon as possible. Many Labour Members agree with that, but it must be in the right circumstances and under the right conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The managing director said that his firm's prices had lost about 40 per cent. against European currencies. However—and this relates to comments made by my hon. Friend the Minister—he said that he had looked for other markets, had switched his market to Asia and the far east, and that about 50 per cent. of his firm's work came from that area. He also said that he was trying to get into the American market because the parity with the dollar meant that his firm could compete properly, but that there was some form of hidden protectionism there. That market was fragmented, he said, and he could not get into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is complicated. People in my constituency have been exporting for several years and have a significant background in it, and there are generations of skilled workmen there. However, they are not facing only the strength of the pound. Some of those people have been in business long enough to remind me of their difficulties when the pound was weak, and they tell me that they want a stable currency and stable exchange rates. In markets where there are stable exchange rates, such as those of the far east and America, people can trade with confidence, and have done so for some years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The textile industry is a significant but reducing presence in my constituency, for the same reason that its presence is reducing in the constituencies of other hon. Members. Some producers have resorted to bringing in unfinished cloth to take advantage of the strong pound and the exchange rate and to try to reduce the total production costs, but they cannot compete with the wage rates that are being paid in parts of the developing world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I say here is what I say to them—that I certainly did not come into politics to encourage my Government to prevent people in the developing world from getting jobs. My neighbour and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development, the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) and I have discussed that subject, for which he has a special responsibility and interest. If the only competitive advantage that those developing countries have over the developed world is their wage rates and the cost of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
their labour, we have a moral and political obligation to recognise that they must be assisted, although not at the expense of workers in our constituencies. Allowing those economies to develop at the pace that they should and to compete properly with us is in the long-term interests of the world economy. I am not in the business of protectionism, although I recognise the pressure that that puts on my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I share that argument with people who have lost jobs in the textile industry, many of them appreciate it and share my ideals in international trade, although they have an understandable self-interest. It is not a straightforward issue: there are many complicated and disparate interests in the Scottish economy and our interests do not lie solely within our own borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, Robert Mackie and Sons, a prominent textile manufacturing business in my constituency, tells me that the rate against the dollar is stable or moves only within a narrow band. The company has experienced a major improvement in its exports to the American market and also has a growing presence in the Japanese market. The problem in Europe is the instability of the rate, which has fluctuated by 20 per cent. in 15 months. Instability rather than the rate itself is the main problem, though the rate can be difficult. Business can be lost as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another constituency interest—Scotch whisky. It provides substantial and iconic—if there is such a word—employment in my constituency, as a Scotch whisky plant is situated right in the middle of its main town. It has been under serious threat recently—not because of the strength of the pound and the number of orders, but because of the organisation and restructuring of United Distillers and Vintners. The Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) and other Ministers made an important contribution to encouraging the industry to stay in my constituency. I wish to thank them—and, indeed, the people of Kilmarnock—for helping to ensure that the then 450 jobs became 550 jobs as a result of redistribution and increasing investment in the Johnnie Walker plant in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon partly misrepresents the state of the Scotch whisky industry. Of course it is experiencing difficulties in European markets because of the strength of the pound vis-à-vis European currencies, but it is enjoying increasing markets in Asia and north America, and significant improvement in Switzerland and other countries that have changed their duty barriers and ended discrimination. British Ministers have sometimes provided significant assistance in persuading other countries, in international trade talks, to change their duty regimes in order to allow whisky to compete fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon's analysis—based on a newspaper article rather than the industry's own publications about the position in Europe—was simplistic. Yes, closer to home, people say the weak euro has depressed shipments to Europe and the volume of exports is said to be down by around 5 per
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
cent. However, contrary to what the hon. Member for Gordon quoted from the press, the market in Spain continued to show growth—an 8 per cent. rise of £254 million—and consolidated its position as the second most valuable export for Scotch after the USA. So even within the euro zone and within the area recognised as experiencing problems with the exchange rate, an industry properly geared to take advantage of export opportunities can do so. As I said, the Spanish market has grown, which shows that the view put forward in the press is often simplistic. Significant qualifications underlie most stories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The message is mixed. There are some causes for concern. As I said earlier, I would be a complacent Member of Parliament if I did not have regard to the messages that I receive from manufacturers and exporters in my constituency. I am not complacent. Ministers, including Treasury Ministers, will confirm that I regularly speak to them about such matters. There is no homogenous lump of complacency on the Labour Benches. We interact with Ministers and bring issues to their attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to share with the Committee some other statistics about my constituency, which are not provided by Government spin doctors, taken from Government publications or even from the statistical service provided by the House of Commons. Although my constituency is systemically one of the highest areas of unemployment in Scotland, it has experienced a significant increase in employment. Many of our constituencies have experienced dramatic increases in the employment of young people. Youth unemployment in my constituency is down by more than 50 per cent. The headline figures for employment are the best for around 20 years—in my constituency, the best since 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also clear, Mr. Maxton—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry, Mrs. Michie. I wrote down Mr. Maxton, that is why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth restating what the Minister of State said about the yen being back to its 1996 level. If the relative strength of our currency against Europe is the cause of problems, surely economic reform in the continental states of Europe rather than in the United Kingdom is also necessary to bring the currencies into parity. The discussions in Lisbon, attended by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, dealt with that. I am surprised that members of two such strongly pro-European parties attending our debate today have made no mention whatever of the performance of other European economies and their need to catch up with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not within the remit of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is not within the Minister's remit, but to some degree, it is. That was the point made by the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale. He argued that it was directly within the Minister's remit and that Scotland's voice was not strong enough. It certainly is within the remit of conducting a balanced debate. We should discuss issues in their wider context, not in a distorted context. The impression is being created that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
problems that have bedevilled Scottish manufacturing and exporting are entirely the Government's responsibility and that the rest of the world, with whose exchange rates we have to relate, has no responsibility for achieving a balanced economy. That is not true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by the two examples provided by the hon. Members for Gordon and for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale. They were classic examples of "something needs to be done". Let me share with the Committee a contribution by George Lyon, MSP and economic spokesman for the Liberal Democrats. In a debate about manufacturing on 29 September 1999, he made a classic "something needs to be done" contribution:
	<br><q><p>There is only one way in which to achieve a more realistic exchange rate. The three political parties in Scotland who favour the UK's joining the euro must confront the Tory Eurosceptics head on and put forward clear arguments in support of joining when the exchange rate is at the appropriate level.—[	<i>Scottish Parliament Official Report,</i> 29 September 1999; Vol. 2, c.831.]</p></q>

From the earlier Labour interventions—sedentary and otherwise—one might have thought that the subject was not worthy of discussion, because the industrial scene was so wonderful and glowing. Taking to the hustings at this early stage is a misdirection of the Committee's energies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some problems in the industries that are central to the Scottish economy, and particularly the rural economy. Tourism has not attracted much attention except some laughter from Labour Members, who are clearly not tremendously interested in it, but it is the third biggest employer in Scotland. It is worth £2.5 billion and consists of 20,000 businesses, employing 180,000 people. The high pound means that more Scots take their main holidays abroad and overseas visitors complain that our costs are too high. Coupled to the cost of petrol in rural and remote areas, the value of the pound is adverse to the interests of our constituents trying to promote tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
The Government have not favoured the agricultural industry with any attention in the debate, so I hope that the Minister will talk about it in his closing speech. In many parts of Scotland, that industry's position is tragic. I attended a meeting in my constituency recently with farmers who were trying to raise money for a benevolent fund to help those in desperate straits. I sat at a table with eight people and asked them about their profitability. One person said that he had not made a profit for four years. Another said that he had not made a profit for three years. Around the table, the picture was the same. I will not read out the National Farmers Union statistics; they are available to everyone. They illustrate the reality of the situation in many farms, which are also in less-favoured areas, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) said.

I welcome the outcome of last week's summit. It was important and it was a step forward, but it has not made up the gap caused by the diminution of the support systems and the price of the product abroad. The difficulties faced by our food producers have not been removed altogether. Those problems flow from the fact that produce from Europe, from where we take much of our food, is priced competitively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should not have been necessary to devote attention to such matters in the debate, because they are well known in the Committee. We should have tried to deal with how to tackle the problems effectively, but instead it has been necessary to mention such facts, and the fact that the chairman of the CBI Scotland Hugh Currie, said clearly in 	<i>The Herald</i> that Ministers did not seem to understand that the exchange rate was a problem for Scottish manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is odd that we had such an argument about textiles without referring to the views of the industry's representatives. They have said that it is a major issue. In a letter to its members, the director of the National Wool Textile Export Corporation referred to the disadvantages faced by the British textile industry in Europe. He said:
	<br><q><p>British mills are around 20 per cent. overpriced when viewed against the local competition, even though Italians pay their operatives more and pay more for the purchase of raw materials in Euros.</p></q>
It is not a matter of low wages, but one that needs to be dealt with by micro measures to assist such industries. The corporation favours the abolition of the three times rule on the suspension of grants for overseas export fairs. The Government should correct the major mistake that was made soon after they came to office in respect of our stance towards the European currency. We must signal our intention to join—we should have joined before. I cannot make the case in 30 seconds—no doubt I shall be told that I have not been constructive—but how do the Government propose to get the country into the euro so that such disadvantages are minimised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

elements in any economy: interest rate control, exchange rate control and inflation. It is clear that the Government have chosen to stabilise wages and prices inflation by using interest rates and not to distort the exchange rate artificially. I raised the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer before and after the election, and I am convinced that his policy is right. If we intervened in the exchange rate to reduce it, it would cause a rise in inflation, wages and prices that would destabilise matters. The manufacturers to whom I speak say that non-interference is fundamental to their present decisions, their long-term investment decisions and their ability to do business throughout the world. Everyone accepts the Government's intervention in sectoral problems using fiscal policy.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just returned from China, where it is clear that Scottish manufacturers are doing exactly what the Minister said they should do. They want to diversify their markets, make inroads in new areas, create employment and extend arrangements to markets where the exchange rate is not so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing gains an advantage by cheaper imports. At the heart of my constituency is Grangemouth, where the petrochemical and chemical industries are buoyant. AstraZeneca is about to announce a £50 million investment in yet another new product. BP Amoco, which is also in the town, has invested £1.5 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although that company is based in London, it is an American as well as British corporation. It is choosing to invest in Scotland, not only because of the advantage of its location near to the source of raw materials, but because of the innovations and productivity that have been demonstrated by the Scottish economy. Low-sulphur diesel is one of its products, as are several downstream chemical products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of product differentiation, I commend my hon. Friend the Minister on the way in which he has tackled the problems with the USA and the banana regime. There has been success with the niche marketing of £2 million of soap and bath products in the USA, and the exchange rate has not been a disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AstraZeneca, which was formerly part of ICI, has now formed Syngenta and is a multinational company, rather than just a British company. It developed Amistar, which is now the biggest selling biodegradable fungicide in the world. It has taken the market by storm. Output has trebled and 400 to 500 extra staff—highly paid staff—have been taken on in Grangemouth. It will announce a further £50 million in the next few days to develop a new fungicide, which will only be made in Grangemouth. I believe that sales of that product will grow at the same rate. Product
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
innovation is therefore crucial. Clearly, the exchange rate causes a slight disadvantage, but innovation and high skill levels can overcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of trying to sell the products of cheap labour, or cheap manufactured products, we must sell high quality innovative products. Everywhere I go, people say that it would be easier if the exchange rate were different. However, if the exchange rate was forced down and inflation was allowed to grow, a spiral of inflation would result, which would destabilise world markets and our future plans. I despair when I hear Liberal Democrat Members carping about the problems without suggesting solutions or acknowledging the great disadvantages and dangers of what they propose. We need to engage with the real world, in which it is not possible to pull one lever without distorting the other cogs of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the Chancellor for his strong stance on low inflation. Although it causes a slight advantage in relation to the exchange rate, we can and will live with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) referred to a slight disadvantage. However, in terms of trading with euroland, it is a 34 per cent. disadvantage over 5 years, which is a considerable disadvantage for those who are directly affected. He rightly spoke about the links between exchange rates, interest rates and Government policy. What the Chancellor misses from the equation is that although the Bank of England's monetary policy is independent, it must consider his fiscal and tax policy. The Chancellor's decisions on tax and spending send signals in relation to interest rates, which send signals for the value of the pound. The Chancellor also failed, in the early days of this Government, to embrace the issue of the euro fundamentally and forcefully, which would have sent clear signals to the market and put us in a better position than we are in now. We must learn lessons from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sad thing about the early part of this debate was the complacency that was demonstrated, although contributions have improved. The sedentary and other interventions earlier sent out a sad signal about the need for and importance of this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ignored a whole sector in his speech—the agricultural sector. It is important to hear from him that he is batting for farmers in Scotland. Farming is much more important to the Scottish economy than to the rest of the United Kingdom economy. Only the Prime Minister's intervention, at the 11th hour, obtained anything from the Chancellor for farming, even though hon. Members made that point to the Chancellor and other Ministers throughout the year. The Prime Minister's intervention shows that he recognises that there is a crisis, but its lateness means that there has been much more suffering than necessary, and that not all the agrimonetary compensation available has been taken up. It also means that farmers in this country have suffered disproportionately compared with those in the rest of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
Europe. The Government used to pride themselves on rejecting unilateral action. However, in relation to the common agricultural policy, there is a danger that if the grain barons of East Anglia receive money, Scottish farmers will not receive money as a consequence. To deny struggling Scottish farmers agrimonetary compensation on grain because the Government do not like the CAP is to penalise the victims of the policy rather than to tackle the cause of the problem at its root in the European Union. Tourism is a major industry in Scotland and the sedentary interventions about the lack of sunshine in Scotland misrepresent the climate—certainly in parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How is the Scottish tourist board meant to market Scotland to the rest of the country if those on the Government Benches perpetrate myths about the Scottish climate? Weather forecasts for the UK may plaster a rain cloud right over north-east Scotland, but the mountain ranges ensure that that area has one of the mildest and best climates in the country. We have been able to have picnics outside with the children at weekends even at this time of the year. Denying people that information, which would bring them into our tourism trade, shows great complacency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about saloon bars. The people running those bars notice that there are no foreigners in them because they cannot afford to come to this country. Denying that the currency, the exchange rate and the price of holidays affect our tourism industry shows monumental complacency. I hope that the Minister will accept that those serious issues should be recognised and addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor did not even refer to this important issue in the Budget. He could at least have said that he could not, or did not wish to, tackle the problem faced by those sectors, but that he recognised it. That would have sent a signal that the message was getting through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If after recognising the problem, the Chancellor is not able or willing to tackle it at a global level, he must recognise that those sectors can be helped in other ways. He could consider agri-monetary compensation for farming or examine the tourism and manufacturing sectors. If he cannot tackle the currency barriers to export to Europe, what can he do to tackle the cost of freight, which is a barrier to exports to Europe?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many of us, the argument about the petrol escalators has dwelt on our individual constituents and the problems that they face in living in parts of the world where they have no access to a transport link. The debate has now moved on to a far wider problem: the barrier to freight. Many of us are committed to the importance of the railways, but in north-east Scotland every bridge and tunnel has too many round corners preventing proper-sized containers from getting through. Rail is not the immediate solution, although we hope that that commitment will exist in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Chancellor has all this extra value added tax from fuel, why is he putting up the price of fuel? The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
put up the price of fuel anyway, so why is he using a rate of inflation far higher than that in other calculations? It seems strange that, when taking money in, the Chancellor uses a higher rate of inflation than when giving money out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point of this debate was to make it clear to the Chancellor, who is a member of this Committee, but unfortunately was unable to turn up, that the high pound versus the euro is a problem for the Scottish economy, one about which we in Scotland can have a constructive debate in relation to the UK agenda. In the long term, not one party in the House is in principle against joining the eurozone. Even the official Opposition argue that in principle they are not against it. It was only for one election that they were not willing to join. After that, in principle, they might or might not be willing to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Across the House, therefore, it is recognised that this issue must be tackled. The Government need to show more willingness and the foresight to prepare the country for entry into Europe and send those signals to the market. People do not like putting money into a currency if the long-term aim is to have a different rate of exchange from that of the euro. If the Government do that, our industry could trade fairly and freely within the eurozone and our farmers could have a fair crack at the market in Europe and fair competition with imports from Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the leave of the Committee, should like to reply have enjoyed listening to this debate. Contrary to what the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan), suggested, no Government Member believes that this is not a worthy subject of debate—On the contrary, this is an extremely worthy subject for debate and it was worthy of a better, more balanced view in the opening speeches. We are entitled to expect recognition of the positive side of the story, as well as a litany of woes. That is in the interests not of the Government but of the people at the sharp end, exporting and creating jobs in Scotland, and I pay tribute to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to point to the increase in Scottish exports last year in metals and metal products, up by 18 per cent.; in chemicals and man-made fibres, up by 18 per cent.; and in food and tobacco, up by 13 per cent. There are plenty of good news stories to tell, including the fact that the electronics industry is, by a colossal margin, the biggest element in Scottish exporting. All we ask for is a little balance in reporting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) pointed out the Opposition's unwillingness to talk about the weakness of the euro as opposed to the problems created by the strength of the pound, which again suggests a certain imbalance. There is stability in our exchange rate with the yen and the dollar, so is everybody out of step except the European Union and the euro, or are there structural problems to be addressed there?

In direct response to the question from the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale

(Mr. Morgan) about preparation for the euro, the Government published a second national changeover plan on 9 March for consultation, outlining progress so far and the further steps needed if the United Kingdom decides to join the single currency early in the next Parliament. We are preparing intensively for a genuine choice at that time. Phrases such as "embracing the euro" are pretty meaningless. It suggests some messianic zeal whereby the nation will suddenly go down on its knees and say, "That's all right, then." It is a departure from reality. We are committed to a referendum on the subject. One thing that would be worse than not having a referendum would be having a referendum and losing it. From the point of view of all the members of the Committee, that would be the worst of all options. A few self-delusory opinions have been expressed about Scotland somehow busting a gut for membership of the euro while the rest of the UK are laggards trailing behind, as usual. There is a gap between rhetoric and reality on those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's objectives are clear, but we are also committed to holding a referendum. That referendum must be on the basis of the conditions being right and the expectation that public opinion is behind that major step in policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect an answer, but I am entitled to ask the Liberal Democrats a question. They criticise my right hon. Friend the Chancellor for not using other levers at his disposal, and the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) said in winding up that he could use the lever of tax and spend. Everyone knows that the levers of tax and spend can be used, but which ones do the Liberal Democrats recommend that he uses and in what way? Do they want to increase tax and cut public expenditure? If that is their programme, it is perfectly honourable to say so, but it is not very honourable simply to stand up and say that the Chancellor could do something about tax and spend. Unless qualified, it means nothing at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On one aspect of taxation we know that extraordinarily—bizarrely, in my view—the Liberal Democrats want to increase the price of petrol by 5p more a litre than anybody else does, without qualification in any part of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is totally misrepresenting that policy. Every penny raised by that increase was to go back to the motorist in the abolition of vehicle excise duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What he did not mention was the abolition of VED on vehicles up to 1600 cc. People who are imprudent enough to drive larger cars will get the chop. It is interesting that foreign tourists will not benefit from the abolition of VED; the will have to pay the liberal 5p tariff per litre throughout the highlands and islands an Dumfries and Galloway. What about small businesses? Many of them cannot use a vehicle of less than 1600 cc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
The Liberal Democrats performed a large confidence trick, particularly at the Scottish elections, by going round with petitions and managing to persuade people that their party was against high petrol prices. Somehow they disguised from the electorate as a point of environmental virtue the fact that they are actually the party that wants higher petrol prices than any other party. That is the reality, and it should be made clear in rural areas of Scotland between now and the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne): we are against protectionism and using trade as a vehicle for that. However, that does not mean writing off the textile industry. I am passionate about that. The cashmere industry is an example, as is the company in my hon. Friend's constituency and also in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna)—the original mackintosh company. The Harris Tweed company, which my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) knows all about and in which I have taken an interest, is another example. All those companies can compete and have a massive future. However, it must be based on quality, uniqueness and niche marketing. All those companies can do a good job. That is where the future of the Scottish textile industry lies and it is a major future within our economy. Daks-Simpson is also showing how that can be achieved, not on the same mass scale, but on a significant scale with regard to employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun also spoke about whisky, particularly the exports to Spain. If all that people do is whinge about the exchange rate, it might be thought that the sale of whisky has collapsed throughout Europe. I visited the Diageo bottling plant at Hillington, whose production line is churning out J & B for the Spanish market. Whisky is not an exchange rate issue, but a marketing issue. Scotch and Coke is the drink of Spanish youth. We could discuss in a debate on health whether that is a good thing, but that is the reality. It is better than Bells and Irn-Bru. Scotch whisky has attracted the Spanish market. Therefore, the exchange rate is not an issue. The stuff is being churned out in large volumes, which means jobs in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the issues related to tourism. Most of my hon. Friends present have as extensive an interest in the tourist industry as have Conservative Members. It is a bit patronising to suggest that nobody here—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is a distinction between laughing at the issue and winding up someone who is speaking about it. If the hon. Gentleman's rule of thumb were applied, nobody in this place would ever laugh about anything, in case he were accused of laughing at the subject under discussion, and this place would be even grimmer than it is. People laughed at me just now, and I do not take exception to that.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
Of course, the high exchange rate has an impact on tourism. However, I suggest to the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan), who has been involved in such issues for a long time, that quality is another part of the problem. Not all the problems of the Scottish tourist industry are due to the high exchange rate; we must look at internal issues. My colleagues in the Scottish Executive are putting in place a tourism strategy. My first action at the Scottish Office after the election was to give an extra £1 million to the Scottish tourist board. We have done reasonably well by the tourism industry, although we can doubtless do better. We will listen to people and try to do better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to retain a sense of perspective. At the meeting in Downing street last week, an extra £200 million was committed to UK agriculture. That money comes on top of many other support packages, and £39 million of it came to Scotland. It was welcomed by the Liberal Democrats' colleague, Mr. Ross Finnie, who recently praised the diversification measures taken by Scottish farmers. That money does not amount to nothing. If the Liberal Democrats will not say how much they want to put into agriculture over and above what we have put in—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, it is still a question of how much. We are talking about 85 per cent. of the agri-money compensation coming from the UK Treasury. There has to be a figure.

It might be appropriate to declare an interest at this stage. Like most members of the Committee, I would like to become a pensioner one day—although some hon. Members will become pensioners before others. I hope that that is not taken to mean that I am laying the foundations for my retirement and that of other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is about the contribution made to Scotland's prosperity by our older citizens, who make up a growing percentage of the population in all our constituencies. In my constituency, there are 15,500 pensioners—just short of 25 per cent. of the electorate. Moreover, those numbers are increasing all the time. There are 400,000 more pensioners in Scotland today than there were 50 years ago. Sadly, society has not kept up with that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Help the Aged estimates that 70,000 pensioners in Scotland still live in severe poverty, and one in three suffers from fuel poverty. We all make contributions
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
while we work and receive a basic state pension when we retire. However, it has never been enough on its own, even though it is the foundation of the pension system. That is why the graduated pension was introduced in the 1960s. In 1978, the state earnings-related pension scheme was introduced. Even those measures did little for pensioners who earned low incomes throughout their working lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1980, the basic state pension has been linked to prices, not earnings. Indeed, my understanding—although the Minister might want to clarify this—is that the state pension was linked to earnings for only four years, and that was almost a quarter of a century ago, during the 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many believe that the basic state pension has increased year on year. However, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Social Security said during an Opposition day debate in January that there were many years when it did not increase, such as 1956, 1957, 1959 and 1960. Increases that were expected in May 1964 and November 1970 also never came about. Although I appreciate that it is inappropriate to make party political points in Adjournment debates, it is worth noting that a Labour Government was not in power on any of those occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, the state pension was worth only 20 per cent. of male earnings in 1977–78 and only 14 per cent. in 1994. It is estimated that, if the present policy continues, the state pension will be worth only 9 per cent. of average male earnings by 2020.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 14 February, several hon. Members visited my constituency with the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs to carry out an investigation into poverty. We took the opportunity to meet representatives of Dumfries and Galloway Elderly Forum. They made a strong argument for significant increases in the state pension for everyone, irrespective of their circumstances. I understand how strongly pensioners in my constituency and those of other Members feel about restoring the link with earnings. I have great sympathy with those feelings. We can understand people's anger this week when they went to the post office or checked their bank statements and saw that their pension had increased by 75p, but simply to restore the link with its earnings is fraught with difficulties and I question to what it extent it would alleviate pensioner poverty in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland alone, it would cost about £75 million every year in which the link was in place—more than £750 million in 10 years. There are nearly 11 million pensioners in the United Kingdom and it is estimated that there will be 14 million by 2030. The cost of restoring the link with earnings would be more than £30 billion. Most of the money would go to well-off pensioners who do not need more, while those on the minimum income guarantee would benefit far less as they would lose income support pound for pound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not oppose the restoration of the link with earnings, but the income of the least well-off—20 per cent. of single pensioners—has risen by only 28 per cent. in real terms since 1979, whereas the incomes of the richest pensioners have risen by 76 per cent., and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
the restoration of the link would do nothing to close the gap. The most effective use should be made of scarce resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to tackle pensioner poverty, resources should be targeted at those who live in poverty. I therefore welcome the fact that, this month, about 200,000 pensioners in Scotland are eligible to claim not only their basic state pension but the minimum income guarantee, taking their income to at least £78.45 for a single pensioner and £121 for a couple. The figure has increased by the value of earnings and will continue to do so each year at least for this Parliament and, we hope, beyond it, meaning that each year about 2,000 more pensioners in Scotland who are just above the MIG threshold for income support will be entitled to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, about 200,000 pensioners in Scotland are entitled to claim the MIG but, sadly, 50,000 do not claim their full benefit. I therefore warmly welcome the campaign launched in Scotland last week by my hon. Friend the Minister of State to urge those pensioners who are entitled to income support to claim it. I hope that the take-up campaign is successful, as the pensioners who miss out are those who live below the poverty line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success rate of such campaigns is mixed. Yesterday, Mrs. Michie, you spoke to benefits agency staff in your constituency about pensioner poverty; they know that the situation is not new. For 30 or 40 years, pensioners have been encouraged to claim what is rightfully theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, the Government published a report entitled "Helping Pensioners—a Contextual Survey of Income Support Pilots" which found that 40 per cent. of pensioners said they would definitely claim the minimum income guarantee as a result of the campaign and 18 per cent. said that they would probably claim. Unfortunately, 36 per cent. said that they would not claim, possibly because of the stigma attached to doing so or because of the practical difficulties of filling in the form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister aware that some pensioners do not take up income support? No such problem exists in respect of council tax and housing benefit. That may be because local councils have an incentive to get as many people as possible to claim housing and council tax benefit, because the Government will pay the rent and part of the council tax for those claimants. That incentive does not exist in central Government because, to take a cynical view, if people do not claim benefits it saves the Government millions of pounds a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that eventually there will be a system in which local Government data and income support are linked and pensioners who fill in housing benefit forms will be told later that they are entitled to a full rent rebate and will automatically qualify for income support to make up the minimum income guarantee. It is an idea worthy of consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My local council in Dumfries and Galloway recently introduced a revised charging policy for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
services such as meals on wheels and home care. The changes to the policy—that I would say were made without adequate consultation—gave rise to a great deal of criticism and resentment, in particular from local care groups such as Age Concern and the Princess Royal Care Trust. When the revised policy was introduced, it required the council to carry out a re-assessment of the income of all pensioners receiving any service at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As part of the re-assessment, the council gave a commitment to carry out a benefits check for all those who were assessed for the charging policy. Sadly, because it was a purely discretionary move, the council has since reneged on that commitment. It was under no legal obligation to carry out such checks but, at the end of the day, they would have benefited many pensioners in my constituency and that of the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan).

I firmly believe that carrying out benefits checks for our pensioners should be not at the discretion of local authorities, but a legal obligation on either local councils or welfare of officers, funded directly by the Department of Social Security, preferably independent of the Benefits Agency. I hope that the Minister will consider taking the matter up with the Department of Social Security. Perhaps older citizens could be employed to speak to their peers, using their expertise and experience to encourage people to claim what was rightfully theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a group of pensioners who do not qualify for the minimum income guarantee because they have managed to save something for their retirement or have made a small pension provision for themselves, but who are by no means wealthy. The Chancellor announced a number of welcome measures in the recent Budget to increase the savings that can be built up before benefit starts to be lost: the lower capital level will be increased from £3,000 to £6,000, the upper limit will move from £8,000 to £12,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pensioner tax credit is also being considered, as are measures to reward low-income pensioners just above the minimum income guarantee level, possibly by the introduction of some form of income taper. However, pensioners in Scotland who are just above the qualifying income level for the minimum income guarantee feel aggrieved that, having accumulated modest savings or an occupational or private pension, they are only a couple of pounds a week better off than the poorest pensioners. Some feel that they would have been better off spending their money when they were more active. I urge the Minister and the Secretary of State to encourage the Secretary of State for Social Security and the Chancellor to consider measures to address the low incomes of those pensioners during the lifetime of this Parliament.

The Government have, however, delivered help to all Scotland's pensioners, irrespective of their income, including the 15,500 pensioners in my constituency. They have cut VAT on fuel, which the previous Government—let us be honest—wanted to increase to 17.5 per cent. They have delivered the winter fuel payment of £100 for pensioner households, to be

increased to £150. Having been in a pretty cold Campbeltown yesterday with a number of members of the Scottish Affairs Committee, it was brought home to me once again just why Scotland's pensioners in particular warmly welcome that measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have restored free eye tests for all pensioners, so disgracefully removed by the previous Government, and this autumn those over-75 will receive free television licences. In my constituency, 6,000 pensioners will be £104 a year better off As time progresses, I hope that free TV licences will be extended to include all pensioners, because there are pensioners in their late 60s who also find themselves stuck at home with nothing else but a television. We have a moral duty to try to alleviate some of their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taken together, all those measures mean that the Government will have spent more than £700 million extra for pensioners in Scotland during this Parliament. They have already spent more than £80 million more on measures for pensioners in Scotland than would have been spent had we simply restored the link between the state pension and earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Poverty is not simply about income. There is an obvious link between income and physical health involving, among other things, poor living conditions and inadequate transport, but I appreciate those are matters for our colleagues in the Scottish Parliament. There is also a less obvious link between poverty and poor mental health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our election manifesto, the Government promised that a royal commission would examine the funding of long-term care for the elderly. That was set up in 1997; the Sutherland committee reported in March 1999 and concluded that there was no obvious answer. It made 23 recommendations, some of which have already been implemented, but there is frustration that the Government have not made a final decision. Will my hon. Friend, the Minister, perhaps through the comprehensive spending review, or soon after, make a decision? Far too many of our elderly people worry about what will happen if they become so infirm that they have to move from their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members believe that a real start has been made, but there is still much to do. For thousands of retired Scots there is little left over at the end of each week to enjoy things that many in the working population take for granted. We know only too well that much more needs to be done. We must continue to target extra support to the poorest pensioners, but more assistance also needs to be provided for those on a slightly higher, but still modest income. We have to make sure that we genuinely tackle poverty because elderly people in Scotland deserve more; they have worked hard all their lives and I hope that as time passes they will be able to share in Scotland's prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

for Dumfries (Mr. Brown), on securing the debate and on the sensitive and thoughtful way in which he presented his points. I noted his comments about the long-term care of the elderly; I shall not get round to addressing them now, but I shall write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody can or should try to deny that some pensioners suffer real hardship. On 29 March, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security published a paper on pensioner incomes that contained some heartening news. It showed that, on average, pensioners' incomes in 1996–97 had increased by more than 60 per cent. in real terms since 1979. That compares with an increase in average incomes by 38 per cent. in real terms. However, that was only part of the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper also showed that the gap between rich and poor pensioners increased substantially since 1979. The increase in pensioners' incomes was mainly among the top three-fifths; those in the bottom fifth of pension and income distribution did not share in the general growth in prosperity. That is why the Government are right to target health to pensioners in greatest need as a first priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, last week I was pleased to launch the minimum income guarantee take-up campaign in Scotland, to help the poorest pensioners who are most in need. From this month, the minimum income guarantee assures the youngest pensioners of a weekly income of £78.45 for single people and £121.95 for couples. The figures are higher for older and disabled pensioners. For many people, the increases are well worth having. Under the minimum income guarantee, a single pensioner will be at least—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister. I know that he is replying to his hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to face the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters and you, Mrs. Michie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the minimum income guarantee, a single pensioner will be at least £280 a year better off, compared with the position before April 1999. An older pensioner couple could be as much as £455 a year better off in real terms after this month's increase. We estimate that in Scotland, around 150,000 pensioners already benefit from the minimum income guarantee. As my hon. Friend said, however, we also estimate that around 50,000 pensioners in Scotland who could benefit from the guarantee are not currently claiming their entitlement. As a rule of thumb, I suppose that that means that 600 or 700 elderly people in his constituency and mine are not receiving their entitlement. We all have an obligation to address the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it on record that my colleagues in the DSS have set up a hotline, so that pensioners, their carers or friends who think that they may be entitled to the minimum income guarantee can obtain more information. I urge all those who think that someone may not be receiving their entitlement to request a claim form. The telephone number is 0800 028 1111. Calls to this number are free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
I noted my hon. Friend's other useful comments and suggestions on how to accelerate the update, especially to overcome the reluctance to claim entitlement. I shall ensure that he receives a full response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred in his opening statement to some of the changes in the Budget that will help pensioners. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor will announce a doubling to £6,000 of the lower capital limit to the minimum income guarantee and an increase in the upper limit from £8,000 to £12,000. Pensioners who have managed to save for their retirement can still qualify for extra support. That will benefit 9,000 of the poorest pensioners in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, the establishment of thresholds create resentment and a sense of injustice. Some people will fall just outside those lines, but pensioners will be happy that the Government have started to tackle the long-standing grievance of pensioners who had some savings and a little capital and were therefore disqualified from claiming benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor also announced that the Government would consult on how to develop a new pensioners' credit, designed to do more for pensioners with modest occupational pensions and savings. We are helping our poorest pensioners, but we must also ensure that those with modest savings do not lose out. That is an important message to pensioners who harbour a long-standing resentment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fuel poverty is an obvious problem, especially in Scotland's uncertain climate. It is a colder climate, although one cannot generalise. There are very cold places in England and less cold places in Scotland, but, clearly, for geographic reasons the climate is on average colder in Scotland than in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1999, the winter fuel payment was increased fivefold from £20 to £100 per eligible household. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget that next winter the payment will be increased to £150 per eligible household. This winter the Government paid out around £70 million to some 900,000 eligible pensioners in Scotland. As I am sure he is aware, the Government paid out more than £1,100,000 to some 15,000 people in my hon. Friend's constituency of Dumfries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security announced that the age of eligibility for winter fuel payments would be equalised, making winter fuel payments payable to men and women from the age of 60. That change will be backdated to 1997. The DSS estimates that in Scotland up to 190,000 people will be eligible for backdated payments and up to an extra 150,000 people will be eligible from next winter. Again, substantial numbers of our constituents will benefit. In addition to winter fuel payments, almost 20,000 cold weather payments have been made in Scotland this winter, amounting to some £170,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
It is only fair to say that our colleagues in the Scottish Executive also play their part in helping to combat fuel poverty in Scotland. The warm deal replaced the home energy efficiency scheme in Scotland from 1 July 1999. Under the warm deal, grants of up to £500 are available to pensioners and families on low incomes. The grants can cover loft and/or cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, energy efficient light bulbs and energy advice. Pensioners can find out if they are eligible for warm deal grants by calling the Energy Action Grants Agency, which administers the warm deal. Again, I shall put the telephone number on the record, as I am aware that the 	<i>Official Report</i> is read in libraries and so on. It is 0800 072 0150.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme also provides employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed through the new deal. Around 400 new deal placements have been created in Scotland, so in addition to benefiting pensioners and people on low income, the warm deal also benefits our younger people who are looking for work. It is a good example of joined-up Government in action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another significant step to reduce fuel poverty in Scotland was our decision to cut VAT on domestic fuel from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent. As we have already heard, that produced a disproportionate benefit for pensioners. We are determined to ensure that we provide the best possible service to pensioners. That is why on 15 March my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security announced that the DSS would bring pensions and pensioner services into a single dedicated DSS unit. That will provide a central service covering state retirement pensions, minimum income guarantee and the oversight of regulation of private-sector pensions. We intend to provide a central point providing help with pension claims, access to other benefits and services and information about how pension rights are built up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to SERPS. Recently, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security made a major announcement about entitlement to inherited SERPS. The previous Government made a number of pensions policy changes, one of which would have meant that from this April a husband or wife could inherit a maximum of one half of their spouse's SERPS entitlement. My right hon. Friend announced that the change would not now be made until 6 October 2002. It has given rise to much anxiety among pensioners. As a result of my right hon. Friend's announcement, anyone who is widowed before 2002 will not be affected. Their spouse will still be entitled to inherited SERPS under the current rules. Anyone who is in doubt about their entitlement can ring the following number: 0845 600 6116.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have time to go through the various other measures we are taking to support pensioners. However, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said at the outset, a great deal has been done. The 75p increase is a small part of the overall pattern. On the other hand, nobody for one moment disputes that there is more to do.
