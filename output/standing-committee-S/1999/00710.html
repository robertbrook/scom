	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first subject is a statement on the Scottish contribution to international development. There is no time limit on the statement or subsequent questions, but my decision on when to conclude the debate will have regard to the fact that the ensuing debate on employment and fairness at work in Scotland must end at 1 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr. George Foulkes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With permission, I should like to make a statement on the Government's work to eliminate world poverty and Scotland's extremely valuable contribution to that work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Britain's development resources are focused on the elimination of poverty. One in five people live in abject poverty, and we all have a moral duty to ensure that they have the opportunity to improve their lives. The Government's first White Paper on international development "Eliminating World Poverty: A Challenge for the 21st Century" puts the international development targets agreed at the great United Nations conferences of the 1990s at the heart of our work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key target is to halve by 2015 the proportion of the world's population who live in abject poverty. That means lifting 1 billion people out of poverty within 15 years. The targets also require that by 2015 there should be universal access to primary education and reproductive health care, and that infant mortality should be halved. The targets are ambitious but not unrealistic. They are serious projections of what can be achieved if the best practice in development is implemented more widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our commitment is backed by a significant rise in my Department's budget which will increase by 12 per cent. in the current financial year. That is equivalent to £365 million—£1 million extra for each day this year—and is the largest increase in the development budget in a single year. The Government have provided an extra £1.6 billion for development over the three-year period of the comprehensive spending review. That fulfils our manifesto commitment to reverse the long-term decline in aid spending under the previous Although international development is a reserved power, my Department works closely with the Scottish Administration and with Scottish institutions and civil society to achieve the United Kingdom Government's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
objectives. I want to report on our engagement with Scottish civil society, our innovative collaboration with the university of Dundee on water law, our work with Scottish institutions to increase public awareness of development issues and the development of the Scottish Office at Abercrombie house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has an active and varied voluntary sector involved in development work. Civil society organisations and networks play a vital role in empowering poor people overseas not just to tackle their immediate situations but to confront the forces that keep them poor. They also help to build global alliances in support of eliminating world poverty. The joint funding scheme was the main mechanism by which the Department for International Development engaged with civil society organisations in the United Kingdom. It is now the civil society challenge fund. In the past two financial years, the Department contributed nearly £750,000 to Scottish civil society organisations as part of the joint funding scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The challenge fund has £5 million available this year. Some 230 applications have been received from the United Kingdom as a whole, although only seven are from Scottish civil society organisations. I use the word "only" because I believe and hope that the Department for International Development can and should significantly increase its engagement with civil society in Scotland. We are strengthening our ties with organisations already involved in international development work and are engaging with organisations not previously involved in development which share our commitment to eliminating world poverty and have the experience and skills to help us achieve that objective. We want to involve faith groups, including those that represent minority faiths in Scotland, as well as trade unions and community organisations. I urge hon. Members from all parties to use their contacts and influence to spread the word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to our innovative work on water law. Life cannot exist without water, and the social and economic development of too many people is constrained by lack of access to it. Following consultation, my Department is finalising a strategy paper entitled "Addressing the water crisis — healthier and more productive lives for poor people", central to which is our work with Governments to ensure that poor peoples' interests are reflected in legal and regulatory frameworks. Many countries desperately need clearer legal frameworks for efficient and equitable allocation and for effective use of water and to ensure sustainable management of the water resource base for future generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud and pleased to say that the university of Dundee is playing a pivotal role in realising those aims. The centre for energy, petroleum and mineral law has established a fine reputation for international water law and policy. In Dundee, Scotland has the only academic institution in the world that offers postgraduate training in water law and policy. Last year, I had the honour of opening an international water seminar at the university on securing rights to water. In recent years, more than 500 international delegates have participated in such activities and have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
returned from Scotland with knowledge and experiences that they have used to influence the drafting of new national water laws and regulations. University staff have directly provided professional training in Namibia, Uganda, Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and China. That is just one example of the many partnerships with Scottish universities and colleges that are helping towards our goal of poverty eradication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government appreciate that international development targets will not be met without the full support of the British and international communities. We are therefore committed to increasing public understanding of global interdependence and of the need for international development. My Department's development education work focuses on four key target groups: the media, businesses and trade unions, faith groups and the formal education sector, which is our top priority. In January, I met my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), the Scottish Minister for Children and Education, to discuss taking this work further. Our officials are now collaborating on a number of initiatives in curriculum development and teacher training. I welcome the establishment of the Scottish Parliament's cross-party international development group, the inaugural meeting of which I attended. We are keen to establish close working relationships with the group to promote our agenda on devolved matters such as education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, development awareness work has long been carried out by civil society. In Scotland alone there are now four development education centres, as well as a number of civil society organisations that have development awareness programmes. Through our development awareness fund, we are supporting projects managed by the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund and by the Glasgow Media Group, based at Glasgow university. We also have a mini-grant programme managed by IDEAS, the International Development Education Association for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our dialogue with civil society in Scotland is reflected in the continuing transfer of responsibilities and senior policy jobs from London to Abercrombie house in East Kilbride, the Department's Scottish headquarters. Abercrombie house was planned by Judith Hart, Secretary of State for Overseas Development in the previous Labour Government, whom we fondly remember for her excellent work. It opened in 1981, when part of what was the Overseas Development Administration was transferred from London. At that time, Abercrombie house oversaw colonial pensions, accounts, the engagement of consultants and the recruitment of technical co-operation officers to work overseas. Later, parts of our information systems and statistics operations were transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we came into office in 1997, one of the first things that we did was to establish a ministerial office in Abercrombie house. We also realised the potential
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
for expansion, both in the scope of the work and in the numbers of DFID staff located in Abercrombie house. We have an excellent catchment area to provide and to sustain a well-qualified and diverse work force. Following an initial review, we arranged to transfer an additional 40 jobs from our London headquarters. Those included key jobs in our evaluation department and the important new work on development education. The staffing level in Abercrombie house is expected to reach 500 by the end of this year. We are planning a major refurbishment, which will enable us to realise a further increase in capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we came into office, there was one senior civil service job in Abercrombie house. Today, there are five. The number of higher-grade middle management posts has risen from 17 to 24 and we have increased the number of professionals in post from one to four. The great majority of recruitment and personnel work for the whole of the DFID staff, both at home and overseas, is now administered from East Kilbride. This year, we transferred top management responsibility for our entire human resources division to Abercrombie house. The office is now headed by DFID's director of human resources. That is the first time that anyone of that grade has been located in our Scottish office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been helped in our work to increase the responsibility and to raise the profile of our Scottish operation by the interest shown in our work by the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), by Andy Kerr MSP, and also by the provost and members of South Lanarkshire council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recognise from just the few examples that I have given that Scotland and the Scots have made and are continuing to make a great contribution to the United Kingdom's international development effort and we look forward to that contribution increasing over the coming years. I commend the statement to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for an advance copy of his statement. Before I respond to it, I thank all those involved in making the venue run so smoothly for us so far today and for the facilities provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome in particular the Minister's appreciation of the civic society in Scotland and its contribution to international development. Scotland's long history of involvement in the wider world has not always been for the good. Has the Minister had discussions to find out whether the challenge fund has made it more attractive for organisations to do their own thing rather than to go through the red tape involved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, has the Minister recognised the strong support for organisations such as Jubilee 2000, the work of which was highlighted by the recent cycle ride through Scotland? It has been recognised that the Government have come on board in welcoming what Jubilee 2000 stands for. What pressure are the UK Government putting on EU institutions and Governments and on Group of Eight countries to transfer the words of Jubilee 2000 into actions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
The Minister spoke of the need to address health care in the third world. Given that the AIDS summit is meeting today and that more people die from AIDS in the third world than die from war and famine, what concrete steps can the Government take to achieve targets on health care and infant mortality when the AIDS epidemic is so out of control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the kind remarks about the facilities and the arrangements. The hon. Gentleman used the ominous words "so far", but I am sure that the good conditions will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was tempted to start by talking about Mungo Park, David Livingstone and long-term contributions to international development, but thought that my statement was long enough and that those references might have been a little controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The challenge fund is new. We have also introduced programme partnership agreements for the major organisations with which we work. That means that we will enter into long-term funding agreements with some organisations, such as Oxfam and Christian Aid, and we hope that one major Scottish organisation will be involved with the programme partnership arrangements. There have been some criticisms about the arrangements for the challenge fund. We have already changed some of the criteria to take account of those criticisms. I have recently heard some further criticisms and have given assurances to the organisations involved that we will consider those criticisms and make the appropriate adjustments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman mentioned the Jubilee 2000 bike ride. I do not know whether he had the opportunity to welcome the cyclists. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Ms Osborne) and I met them when they came to Troon. We had breakfast with them—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] There were no reinforced bicycles available for me to use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then hot-footed it by car to Glasgow green, where my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Kelvin (Mr. Galloway) and I welcomed the cyclists. That cycle ride, along with all the work of Jubilee 2000, has focused attention on the importance of taking swifter action to meet the needs of developing countries in relation to debt cancellation. My right hon. Friends the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for International Development are at the forefront of activities to speed up debt cancellation. At the meeting of the World Bank in Prague and especially at the meeting in Okinawa, they will press for faster, deeper debt relief for certain countries. We have also put pressure on the European Union, as a result of which I am glad to say that the European Development Fund has now contributed £1 billion euro towards the debt cancellation fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, during the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in South Africa, I went into a township and saw for myself some of the problems in Africa relating to AIDS. I saw the work that we are doing to help with peer education, in which young people tell other young people what needs to be done to prevent AIDS. At the Commonwealth Heads of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Government meeting, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced the British contribution to the AIDS effort—a total of £100 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first question and the Minister's answer to it were very interesting, but lacked brevity. I ask hon. Members and the Minister to be brief, so that we can take as many questions as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have written to the Minister regarding one of my constituents who did a first-class job in waste management in Kosovo. Dalkeith Demolition is the name of the company concerned, but it was involved in building rather than in demolition. My constituent received £65,000 in his hand to go back to the United Kingdom, and he went back through Macedonia. At Macedonia airport, he was thought to be illegally exchanging money. The money was confiscated and the gentleman concerned was fined. The firm is now short of that cash. It is said to be a political situation that will be eradicated by the two Governments, but I would like to know what progress has been made towards retrieving that money, so that it can be refunded to Mr. Scott Crossett.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend is aware, the matter featured in the Scottish press last week. I am aware of the details of Mr. Scott Crossett's case. It took place some time ago, on 24 April, and came to light only recently as a result of an article in 	<i>Construction News.</i> When I first heard about substantial cash payments being made, my instinct was to wonder why. In fact, the payments are made in cash because Kosovo has no banks and the contractors have to pay their subcontractors, so it is not as surprising as it seems. Other aspects were raised in my hon. Friend's letter. The Secretary of State and I are considering an interim report, and we have asked for a further report to establish the full facts. I assure my hon. Friend that as soon as we receive that report we shall write to him and to Mr. Crossett giving full details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) referred to the challenge fund and to problems with bureaucracy, but applying for challenge funding can often involve significant costs, which are particularly important if the bid is unsuccessful. What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that the costs of bidding for the civil society challenge fund are kept to a minimum?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in a speech in June last year, the Minister said that global citizenship would be taught in Scottish schools. What progress has he made in his conversations with the Scottish Minister for Children and Education, the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in reply to the previous question, we are only too aware of the problems of bureaucracy, particularly in something as new as the civil society challenge fund. On 3 August, I shall be meeting the Scottish organisations involved, and we shall be discussing that topic to see whether we can help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Great progress is being made with global citizenship. Although not all hon. Members will agree, we can learn some things from England. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has received an excellent report on the subject that was produced under the chairmanship of Bernard Crick, who, by a strange coincidence, lives in Edinburgh. We can learn much from that report. I have suggested to my hon. Friend the Scottish Education Minister, the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, that we should consider that report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our officials are now trying to include more development issues in the curriculum, not just in geography or modern studies but in all areas of the curriculum. We are considering what support we can give teachers, because they are asked to do an awful lot of extra stuff. For instance, we are considering including extra provisions in literacy work, so that as the children learn to read they will learn also about development issues. We are wondering what support my Department can give, and I was most encouraged by my hon. Friend the Scottish Education Minister's approach. I have received positive responses also from the Education Ministers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's reply on education; it was an important point. He will remember Holy Cross primary school in Croy in my constituency, where the children have done a project on international development issues, particularly child labour. Does he agree that we must build on the children's interest in and understanding of those issues, and that we must build on that natural preserve to help tackle child poverty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will never forget my visit to Croy. I was taken aback by the youngsters' enthusiasm and the way in which they put me on the spot. I assure my hon. Friend that we are taking up that matter. We are also increasing the number of links between Scottish schools and schools in developing countries. I spoke with Joe Wake from the Scotland Office central bureau of educational visits and exchanges last night, and we are taking the matter forward as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it possible to develop a Scottish core of volunteers? Could the Minister's Department co-operate with the Scottish Executive, the churches and faith groups and other Scottish organisations to capitalise on Scotland's great reputation for good work in overseas countries, and further to develop work such as voluntary service overseas? I think especially of people who have taken early retirement but who have talents and who would like to give service overseas, as well as those in training and education. Does the Minister think that idea worth pursuing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is offering to take early retirement—which in his case might not be so early. I recently attended the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
annual gathering in London of the excellent organisation, British Executive Service Overseas, and I spoke at its Scottish meeting a few months ago. It recruits retired professionals and others to help overseas. I commend it to the hon. Gentleman who I know is fed up with boring speeches in the Scottish Parliament. Perhaps he could be doing something of real value in the third world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coatbridge and Chryston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I put my substantive question, may I say how proud we are of the first-class job that my hon. Friend is doing in one of the best Departments in Europe and the rest of the world? Long may that work continue.

On the important subject of AIDS, I am influenced by a visit that Lord Steel and I paid to Uganda five years ago. 	<i>The Guardian</i> today says that two thirds of people in Africa aged 15 to 29 will die of AIDS, and President Mbeki of South Africa yesterday made a profound statement on the subject. I hope that I am not putting my hon. Friend in a difficult position, but would he apportion due weight to poverty rather than HIV with regard to AIDS? Will he comment on how we can deal with the challenge of AIDS on an international basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's first remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be the last person to criticise President Mbeki who is doing a tremendous job in South Africa. However, there are doubts about the scientific evidence on which he has based his judgment questioning the link between HIV and AIDS. We are keen to do everything that we can and are considering what help we can give to develop a vaccine. We are also contributing £100 million towards work in Africa. It does not help the case, however, if we clutch at straws from scientists whose reputations and experience might not be as widespread as those who have established the link.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear the Minister say that. I hope that no succour will be given to President Mbeki who, in other respects, is a first-class politician whom we all respect. Although his work on other matters is exemplary, he is completely out of line with scientific evidence and the rest of the world's scientific community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine that £100 million will be devoted to AIDS. That is welcome, but will he confirm that that amount was set before the pandemic developed in Africa? He said that Scots have a close link with African communities. That is absolutely true, especially with regard to the Church of Scotland, but should not we be doing more? Should he not be taking a lead in spending more money to put preventive measures in place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, as usual, makes his plea eloquently. The UK is doing more than almost any other country on this issue. We are taking a substantive lead. However, there are other problems to consider. We are giving money to help stamp out

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
malaria and for an international campaign on lymphatic filariasis, on which we are involved in a wide range of measures. We will consider whether more money is needed for AIDS when the money that we have allocated for AIDS work is spent. However, our work could be set back substantially if the scientific claims that there is no link between HIV and AIDS are believed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sandra Osborne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that Christian Aid in Scotland, especially in my constituency, makes an important contribution towards international development? He said that we were recently invited to have breakfast together. I would be delighted to have breakfast with him any time, but is he aware that Christian Aid makes efforts to support the peace process in Colombia? Does he know about widespread concern in Colombia that Plan Colombia, which is supported by the United States, might cause the armed conflict to escalate? Will he do everything in his power to ensure that the European community uses humanitarian aid to support the peace process in Colombia?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Committee that Alistair and Liz were present at the breakfast, as well as my hon. Friend and me. She is right to say that the United States provides substantial military support for Plan Colombia. We propose that the European Union should not provide military support, but should help with crop substitution, social support and similar subjects. That would accord with her wishes. My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office will shortly go to Madrid to discuss the European Union's contribution to Plan Colombia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might pass on the Minister's breakfast invitations of the Minister. We have a shared interest in a certain football club, so if there is a spare season ticket, he knows whom to call.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like many of my colleagues, I assume that the Minister has received postcards from several representatives of church organisations on intensifying the relief of international debt. What impact has that substantial number of postcards had on the Government's thinking? Has it led the Government to think that the elimination of international debt should be intensified and its pace quickened? What dialogue has the Minister opened up to ensure that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have resisted all suggestions that international assistance be given to Heart of Midlothian football club. It does not need it yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. Britain has led the international campaign for debt cancellation. We have been had tremendous support from civil society, through the likes of the bike ride, the postcards and the consultation exercise that several of my hon. Friends recently undertook and gave to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He will go to the meeting of finance ministers armed with the strength of thousands of signatures from Scotland, and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister will also attend a meeting in Okinawa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Of the 41 highly indebted poor countries, 13 are currently engaged in conflict. That makes universal primary education and poverty eradication work difficult. That is why my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced that £7.5 million extra will be provided to do what we can to solve those conflicts. Then we can get on with vitally important development work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his part in touring many Scottish constituencies to promote the debt relief campaign. A month ago, he was in St Augustine's church in my constituency, where more than 100 constituents were present. He will be pleased to know that 2,500 signatures have now been presented from my constituency to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor—my hon. Friend the Minister played a part in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the voluntary organisations that carry out that great work in Scotland, the work is sometimes disparate. There is a need to bring the voluntary organisations together. Has my hon. Friend the Minister thought about that? What support can he give to the many good organisations on the ground to bring them together, especially when disasters occur and need an instant, ready response from Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have said that I have also met with Jackie Baillie, who deals with voluntary organisations in Scotland, to discuss ways in which we can co-operate. On 3 August, I am going to a meeting to set up a network of international development organisations in Scotland. The lead in that is being taken by Paul Chitnis, the director of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, one of the leading international development organisations in Scotland. That is a move in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend might also be aware that there is a wonderful organisation in Grangemouth called the International Rescue Corps. It is a United Kingdom organisation, which can provide people to help in disasters at a moment's notice. It has helped in Turkey, Mozambique and central America. Funded by our Department, it is a great organisation, and Scotland should be proud of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Browne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister shares the view of every member of the Committee that it will be a significant development when the leaders of the developed world meet in Okinawa to discuss highly indebted countries and the debt of the poorest countries. However, even if such a development takes place, it seems unlikely at this stage, with the best will in the world, that we shall achieve the objective of the cancellation of debt by the end of this year, as set out by Jubilee 2000 and espoused by our Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the Jubilee 2000 coalition is, constitutionally and financially, due to wind up at the end of this year. It has played a pivotal role in keeping up the pressure in Scotland, the United Kingdom and internationally. Might my hon. Friend's Department and the Government discuss with Jubilee 2000
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
continuing that pressure beyond the end of the year, and would they consider giving it some financial assistance to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already had informal discussions with some people involved in the Jubilee 2000 coalition, and I took part, with thousands of people, many of them young, in the wonderful human chain in Edinburgh. It would be a shame not to mobilise that feeling and to allow it to dissipate after the end of 2000. I have suggested that we would seriously consider proposals from the Jubilee 2000 coalition to continue to mobilise their excellent efforts for poverty eradication, or for universal primary education, for example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development deserve every congratulation for having set up the Department for International Development and achieved a worldwide reputation. One reason for doing so was to separate development and foreign policy to ensure that aid was not used for purposes such as the Pergau dam. A lot of the money involved goes to Europe, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development described as having the world's worst development agency. Does my hon. Friend share my anxiety that political considerations will swamp poverty considerations in the distribution of development money? It cannot be on poverty grounds that Morocco receives more per head from the European Union than any other country in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. In 1987, some 75 per cent. of the European Union's budget was spent on the poorest countries of the world. Ten years later, in 1997, the proportion was down to just over 50 per cent. That cannot be right. The previous Government, none of whom—thankfully—are present—did absolutely nothing about it. They increased the amount going to Europe, but did nothing to increase effectiveness. We have produced a document with 18 specific recommendations to do so. We have held several meetings, and changes are on the way, but we remain dissatisfied with developments in Europe, and we have made it absolutely clear that the delivery of assistance in Europe must be more effective and poverty oriented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Alexander 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press my hon. Friend a little further on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
Okinawa summit. What prospects does he envisage for progress, especially given the conflicts that make the highly indebted poor countries initiative problematic for many countries? Does he envisage a major prospect for change in multilateral aid as a result of the Okinawa summit on 23 July?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Two problems were identified in earlier questions as undermining our efforts to help the poorest countries—AIDS, and conflict in 13 of the 41 countries. We are doing all that we can to ensure that those problems are tackled so that we can get on with poverty eradication. We must not let up the pressure at Okinawa or the autumn meetings of the international financial institutions in Prague. No one in the entire Government is more enthusiastic about debt cancellation than my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That is good news for all of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to my hon. Friend's fine work. I listened with interest to his comments about war and conflict undermining much of the good work of this and many other Governments. That is especially true of the recent conflict in Sierra Leone and the often-forgotten civil war in Angola, where the real source of much of the conflict is the international diamond trade. Will my hon. Friend give the clear commitment that many others have given that the full force of international law will be brought against any British citizen found to be involved in distribution, trading or retailing of illegally gained diamonds that are fuelling civil wars and undermining all the good work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The problem of conflict involving diamonds is difficult, but with British effort, we have at last succeeded in ensuring that a resolution has been passed by the Security Council of the United Nations. That resolution will enable us to take multilateral action. I can assure my hon. Friend that we are also considering legislation in the United Kingdom to pursue further action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned some of the often-forgotten conflicts. My Department is anxious to continue to focus on some of those problems, even after the media focus has turned away. That is why I went to Central America to examine the effects of Hurricane Mitch a year after its occurrence, and that is why I will go to Kosovo next week, to see the effects a year on. We need to keep applying pressure and to continue our activities, even after the cameras of CNN or Sky have left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Employment Policy</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We now move to the main debate on the Government's policies relating to employment and delivery of fairness at work in Scotland. I welcome the Secretary of State to the Scottish Grand Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Stephen Byers)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a privilege to be at the Scottish Grand Committee meeting in Glasgow, and I hope that my appearance also proves to be a pleasure. I will reflect on the Government's achievements on employment and fairness in the workplace in the past three years or so, because I believe that we can be proud of our record. I will also discuss the steps that we need to take in the relatively near future if we are to build on those foundation blocks of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to realise that the current situation did not arise because of an accident or because it was ordained in the stars. When we took office in May 1997, we inherited an economy with built-in inflation. The public finances were in a poor condition. The deficit was growing annually, and the public finances were running out of control. Interest rates were at an unsustainable level for the achievement of the economic growth and stability essential to establish an economy in the United Kingdom and in Scotland that would grow and benefit all our people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We took some tough decisions when we came to office. Some people—including some members of the Committee—criticised them strongly. We decided to stick to tough spending limits and give the Bank of England independence to set interest rates, to ensure that we created a climate in which businesses could plan ahead with confidence. We have managed to achieve that economic stability, which has produced growing employment and enabled us to provide decency in the workplace through minimum standards that stop people from being exploited. As a result, we are also delivering social justice and prosperity, and bringing those two aims together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ensuring the dignity of work means providing jobs as well as setting minimum standards in the workplace. I believe that we have combined those two elements by creating more employment in Scotland and setting minimum standards to protect people from bad employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State referred to stability in the business environment. Only last week, Andrew Fraser, a senior official at the Department of Trade and Industry, talked in a leaked memo about a manufacturing meltdown if sterling continued at prevailing rates and if the Government did not pursue a more assertive policy towards entry into the euro exchange rate system. Some of those nefarious Sunday papers even suggested that the Secretary of State was behind that leak. Since the election, 47,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Scotland. The sterling exchange rate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
has caused well publicised problems in the textile, tourism and farming industries. Does the Secretary of State agree with the recommendations and conclusions of his senior official, Andrew Fraser? If not, which policies does he argue will lower sterling to a more competitive level and give businesses a chance of survival in the business environment to which he refers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I receive a great deal of advice from officials, including Mr. Fraser. The Government have a clear policy on the single European currency. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Gentleman waits a moment, I shall explain it. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has said, there are benefits in joining a successful single European currency: transparency of costs, improvements in trade and currency stability. However, it is important to remember that those benefits could easily be outweighed if we did not join the single currency under the right terms and if the economic conditions at the time were not appropriate. That is why we have laid down the five economic conditions. We have adopted a practical approach, which keeps the single currency open as an option, but does not make it an article of faith. We are putting the interests of industry first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way first to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the paper "Fairness at Work" recognises, in paragraph 1.10, that there is a European dimension. Will the Secretary of State confirm that the Foreign Ministers of the European Union are meeting this morning in its General Affairs Council to consider the consequences of the banana war on the prospects for employment in Europe? What position is Her Majesty's Government taking during those talks? Is there a prospect of an early resolution, which might meet the needs of the Americans, who have an interest in the argument? Tens of thousands of jobs, particularly in the cashmere industry, depend on the outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take this opportunity to deal with that issue early in the debate. The hon. Gentleman is right that the General Affairs Council meets today. Tomorrow, I shall meet the Trade Commissioner, Pascal Lamy, in Brussels. One issue that we shall discuss is possible retaliation by the United States regarding the banana dispute. The Government's view is clear. First, it is wholly inappropriate for the cashmere industry and others, which have nothing whatever to do with the banana dispute, to be penalised and to become the innocent victims of American retaliation. We have relayed that message to the highest levels of the American Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the United Kingdom can play an important role in brokering a deal between the EU and the USA. We need to resolve the issue. The World Trade Organisation regulations must be complied
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
with. We must produce a package of measures that protects the Caribbean economies, because it is important that the legitimate activity of growing bananas is not replaced by an illegal activity, such as drug pushing and dealing. That is a real possibility. The UK Government can play a valuable role. We shall make the strongest possible representations to the USA to try to exclude as many areas as possible from retaliation, if the Americans embark on that course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire about the knife-edge nature of the issue. There is a great deal of concern in the Borders and throughout Scotland about what might happen if there is either no agreement in the EU or an agreement with which the Americans are not happy. Will the Secretary of State give an assurance that, if today's outcome leads to retaliation, he will reintroduce the bond guarantee scheme that he proposed last year and that we welcomed wholeheartedly? The legality of American retaliation is already being challenged by the EU at the WTO, and the highly seasonal nature of the cashmere industry is particularly relevant now, as the knitted garments are being prepared for shipment to the USA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has reminded the Committee, we faced a similar situation at Easter last year, and my Department acted quickly to set up the bond guarantee scheme. That was widely welcomed at the time, and we have given it consideration in case we find ourselves in a similar situation. Discussion with the Scottish Executive will be necessary because different responsibilities have been devolved. We hope that our proposal will offer comfort to those in the cashmere industry, as this is a sensitive time in terms of the cycle of exports and other factors. We are mindful of the issue, given our experience last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned our success in terms of employment, which is a result of the economic stability that we have achieved in the United Kingdom. Scotland now has its highest number of people in work for more than 35 years, or since 1966. As that was the last time that England won the world cup, it is almost a different historical period. However, it shows the success that we have achieved. Most importantly, we have targeted those groups of people who have been unemployed for many years, such as the generation of young people who were totally neglected and laid to waste by the policies of the previous Administration. We are now getting those people back into work. Of nearly 12,000 young people unemployed two years ago, less than 5,000 of them are unemployed today. Twenty-five thousand young people in Scotland found work through the new deal, while another 20,000 young people benefited from full-time education, training or work experience. Earlier this morning, I was pleased to meet a young man who has benefited from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
Government's programmes. Such people have been given real opportunities for the future, in which we can take pride.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That young man is a constituent of mine, and found a job through the Pathfinder Action Team for Jobs initiative, which operates in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development. He is the first person to find a job through those pilot schemes. The important lesson is how simple it was for him to find a job. He needed a comparatively small amount of money to attend an interview and an induction programme. Unfortunately, the benefit service did not allow the Employment Service to give him that money. The Government's initiative, whereby money could be spent outwith the regulations, allowed that young man to be helped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make my right hon. Friend aware of a point that may be useful when he answers questions from the Scottish national party. We recently had the pleasure, in the context of an election campaign, of being told the SNP's 14 priorities for Scotland. Tackling unemployment was not one of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a useful piece of information—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood. My hon. Friend's substantive point was on how the benefits system can be made to work for people. All too often in the past, the benefits system has been a way in which people could remain out of work, which has been condoned. We have tried to use the benefits system as a device to help people return to the world of work. With flexibility and imagination, we are able to do precisely that. That is one of the reasons why the Chancellor introduced the working families tax credit. It is a positive way of ensuring that work pays for people and their families. It ensures that every full-time working family receives at least £200 a week, which makes a real difference. Nearly 100,000 families in Scotland already receive the working families tax credit, and we expect that figure to increase to 130,000 in the near future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the issues of employment and employment statistics. I am particularly interested in the International Labour Organisation employment figures, which show that unemployment was increasing in Scotland in the last quarter when in the rest of the United Kingdom it was falling. I was surprised that the Minister did not refer to that in his speech, because I have been fortunate enough to receive a copy of the ministerial brief, which suggests that the ILO unemployment count is a problem for the Government. What does that say about the pressure that the Scottish economy is really under?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will answer that question specifically. It was not in the ministerial brief, but the hon. Gentleman will get a reply from me. There are two counts: one is the claimant count and the other is the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
ILO count. The claimant count is going down in Scotland as people are coming off benefit and going into work. The ILO count has gone up because more people in Scotland are making themselves available for work because they see that under this Government they have the real opportunity of finding a job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will answer the point. In the past people felt that work was not for them because the Government were not on their side, but we are creating more opportunities so that the Scottish people feel that a job is for them. That is reflected in the ILO figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will be aware that on 19 December 1996 the present Deputy Prime Minister claimed that more people believed in Santa Claus than believed in the claimant count. What credibility can he therefore attach to that defence, particularly his rebuttal of my point about the ministerial brief that I received?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should have stuck at his first intervention. He keeps relying on the ministerial brief. There is more to life than a ministerial brief. Some briefs come from civil servants, who do a very good job. Politicians know the score too. The hon. Gentleman should know that the ILO convention is about people of working age coming forward and saying that they want a job. The figures for the last quarter show that more people in Scotland are making themselves available for work because the Government are making work pay.

People said that that could not be done, but the Government have achieved it and tens of thousands of people here in Scotland are benefiting from our
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
policies. Those are the figures for employment, which is obviously one part of the whole dignity at work agenda. The other aspect is the quality of the jobs being provided. I should like to say one or two things about what we have been able to do for the world of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we have introduced the minimum wage, which benefits more than 100,000 people in Scotland, and have taken action to ensure that it is enforced. We ensured that an electronics factory not far from here that was paying a group of workers from Thailand 95p was fined and that the workers were paid all the money due to them. We have introduced the working time regulations, which, for the first time, give people in Scotland paid holidays, and we have introduced rights for those part-time workers, so that they are no longer treated as second-class citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures on all the measures that we have introduced in Scotland stand for themselves. Nearly 100,000 families benefit from the working families tax credit; more than 100,000 people benefit from the minimum wage; 520,000 part-timers now enjoy the rights of full-time workers; 200,000 women benefit from improved maternity leave rights; 250,000 people benefit from paid holidays, and 50,000 more people are in work. That is a record of which we can be proud, but we need to do—and shall do—more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Union recognition issues have been taken up strongly in Scotland. A month ago we introduced statutory union recognition for the United Kingdom mainland. There was particular concern in Scotland about the position of North sea workers who are not covered by the original proposals and for whom union recognition has not been introduced. I am delighted to tell the Committee that we will extend the right to union recognition to offshore workers, which will cover North sea oil and gas rigs. The measure will come into effect on 14 August.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are fully aware of our proposals.

That balance was out of kilter, which is why we have taken such steps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

will know that certain provisions in relation to mobile workers are slightly different and I will need to clarify the position; it is not in my ministerial brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to mention two points. First, manufacturing is important in Scotland, and we should not lose sight of the fact that many areas of manufacturing in Scotland are a success story. We must also bear in mind that certain sectors are experiencing difficulty and are under some pressure. That is not exclusively a Scottish issue but applies also in Wales, Northern Ireland and certain parts of England. It is important that Ministers in the UK Government and in the devolved Administrations meet and talk about the problems, and the successes, of manufacturing. I am pleased to announce that I shall convene a ministerial meeting involving UK Ministers and Ministers from the devolved Administrations to consider how we can support the manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are particular concerns in Scotland in regard to the shipbuilding industry, and I share those concerns. I represent a constituency on Tyneside, where shipbuilding has historically been a major employer. That is no longer the case, so I appreciate from my own experience the impact that the loss of shipbuilding has on individuals and on the communities in which shipbuilding is based. We now have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get shipbuilding in the United Kingdom on a sound and sure footing. We are about to embark on the biggest warship-building programme that this country has ever seen. The programme will last for the next 10 years, and I want to ensure that all UK yards have the opportunity to benefit from it. As the orders in question are defence orders, every single one of them will be placed with a UK yard. That is why, on Thursday, my right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland and I will convene a meeting of the shipbuilding industry and the trade unions to map out a way forward for the industry. That will enable us to offer some security and hope for the future to the large number of shipyards that currently feel that their future is uncertain, of which Scotland has many. The large programme on which the Government are about to embark provides a great opportunity to ensure that the industry can move away from the old approach of feast and famine. Of course, we must still secure value for money, but as the programme involves defence contracts that are reserved for the United Kingdom, it will offer an opportunity to put the industry on a strong and sound footing for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend understands the importance of the shipbuilding industry for jobs and for the British economy. Does he agree that Govan shipyard has a reputation for building high-quality vessels on budget and on time? Is he aware that more than 80,000 people in Scotland signed a petition in support of the shipyard and its workers? Last week, my colleagues, Jamie Webster, the yard's union convenor, and I submitted the petition to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister at No. 10 Downing street. Will my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has been a powerful advocate for the Govan shipyard, along with other hon. Members. I was inside No. 10 Downing street when the petition was delivered in the middle of last week. When I attended the Scottish trades union congress in April, I spoke with representatives of the work force about the Govan shipyard. At that time, they were concerned about the order for roll-on, roll-off ferries, which we thought was about to be placed. As my hon. Friend will know, we managed to secure the Ministry of Defence's agreement to retender the order. The tenders were received last Thursday and are currently being evaluated. In the light of the strength and quality of the shipyard's work, to which my hon. Friend referred, I hope that it will be in a strong position to secure the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The vast majority of the Scottish population welcomes what is being done. What is being put in place is not just something for the immediate crisis facing Govan but something that will reassure everyone working in shipbuilding, not only in Scotland but throughout the United Kingdom. The action has been long awaited by everyone in the industry and we welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is no doubt in my mind that we are delivering in Scotland on the agenda of social justice and of providing work for people—work underpinned by decent minimum standards in the workplace. People throughout the United Kingdom, including Scotland, have waited years to be in the

present situation. There are jobs for the first time and opportunities are being provided to people. However, they are not any old jobs. The minimum wage ensures that people in those jobs are not exploited through poverty pay. We have achieved balance in the workplace—people in those jobs can stand up to their boss, if that is the right thing to do, knowing that they have the potential to be paid £50,000 and not £12,000, which was the position that we inherited, if they are unfairly dismissed. We are about providing dignity to our people, about providing social justice and about providing a better Scotland in a better Britain. We have set on our tracks to achieving those objectives. There is clearly more to do but we have laid the foundations to provide opportunities in Scotland and dignity in the workplace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Secretary of State to the Grand Committee. I suggested during the first Grand Committee after the establishment of the Scottish Parliament that it would be sensible if United Kingdom Ministers attended Grand Committees because we would be debating UK issues. I welcome the fact that the suggestion has been taken on board. Given the substance of the debate and some of the issues raised, it might have been helpful if the Secretary of State had attended two other Grand Committees in which we debated the value of the pound and the new deal. If necessary, he can turn to the 	<i>Hansard</i> of those previous debates to see how they fit in with what he had to say today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might want to consider whether the time available fits with the number of hon. Members wishing to speak and also the balance of statements in the main debate on the adjournment. A Grand Committee debate on health before the Scottish Parliament was established worked well because we left a lot of time for the main Minister to reply to the debate and to take interventions. In that way, we found the debate on health care to be useful and informative. I will keep my remarks brief because I know that two of my colleagues wish to take part, as others obviously do. As I say, we are running low on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State recognised that the Government's role on employment was nowadays perceived across most of the spectrum as that of doing groundwork and setting a wider economic framework for employment. We keep talking about the history books, but it is in those that the idea that the Government can step in and sort out every problem lies. The role of Government is, at its lowest, to avoid damaging the economy and, where possible, to do the maximum to benefit the economy. As the only party at the general election to favour creating an independent central bank, we welcome the Government's conversion to that policy and their recognition that it will provide stability in planning for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State recognised the problems that the pound creates for the wider economy. If he had studied our debate on that issue, which the Liberal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Democrats chose, he would have learned that many Labour Back Benchers did not share his understanding of the extent to which that was a linchpin to the Scottish economy or of the extent to which the currency issue affects the economy. The Secretary of State addressed the areas of the economy to which his Department related. I hope that he recognises, in the sense of joined-up government, that agriculture and tourism are two major industries in Scotland, which play a part in the underlying economic fabric and obviously affect the manufacturing and supply industries of which he spoke. Those sectors are hit by currency instability and affected by the state of our currency. The Secretary of State said that if we are to create a thriving economic climate, we must focus on providing facilities to help people back into work. In case there is a downturn in the economy, it is crucial to remember that we need a climate in which job losses can be kept to a minimum and investment and long-term development maximised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State referred to the importance of the minimum wage. If we are to share the benefits of the economy, the minimum wage must be uprated independently, effectively, and statutorily every year. Otherwise, there will be a temptation to let it slip behind developments in the economy, and we will fail to ensure that the benefits percolate throughout industry and the working community. The Secretary of State must think carefully about the minimum wage to avoid falling into the trap described by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) on the future of the working families tax credit. In the short term, the working families tax credit makes employment more attractive and helps to eliminate benefits traps, but in the long term, it is in danger of conditioning the market and creating a benefits poverty trap for those on low pay. If the minimum wage does not pick up, employers who employ anyone below the top rate of the working families tax credit will see that they might as well pay them the minimum wage and let the state pick up the full subsidy for the job. The policy can work in the short term but, in the long term, the Government must heed the warnings of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead and think carefully about supporting those on low pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental matter is the economy, which the Government control. However, as the Secretary of State is here, I should also say that, in Scotland, which has a large rural community, the future of sub-post offices and those who work in them causes great concern. Sub-post offices are an important part of the fabric of local communities, and they often sustain the last shop in the community. We welcome the Secretary of State's statement to the House about the Government's plans for sub-post offices. However, there is still a long way to go, and we have not seen the business plans to implement the Government's proposals on sustaining sub-post offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government rightly say that, under the rules, people are allowed to continue to claim benefits from post offices, but there are two problems. First, as a result of the paperwork, people feel a pressure to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
paid through the bank. Elderly people, in particular, feel that pressure when they receive a form to fill in to enable them to be paid through the bank, even if they do not want to be paid in that way. Will the Secretary of State ensure that people receive the message that they are entitled to claim their benefits at post offices? Secondly, the Government's plans to sustain the post office network are crucial to that promise. It is all very well to tell people that they can claim from a post office, but if they cannot find a post office that is open, they cannot make their claim. That is a crucial area of employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that Mr. Janetta, the secretary of the Scottish Federation of Sub-Postmasters, came to the House of Commons and took part in a discussion on the radio with me about the Horizon project, which he opposed? Only two weeks ago, the same man spoke on the radio and was reported in newspapers as saying that he now welcomed the Horizon project and saw it as one of the most exciting and fundamental projects for the future of sub-post offices in Scotland. Clearly, he listened to what the Government said, and now the sub-postmasters are on line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite know why a debate on the radio should be relevant to the Secretary of State. I think that he acknowledged by nodding that there is a long way to go on the inclusion of details in the business plans. Long ago, the previous Government should have embraced the modernisation of the role of post offices in delivering services to the community. However, there is a long way to go before we will see the business plans on the universal bank and how the network will be maintained. Then we shall see how the £400 million that the network receives from the traditional handling of benefits will be made up for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the key areas underlying the economy that were touched on by the Secretary of State—the pound and tourism. If he reads 	<i>Hansard,</i> the Secretary of State will find that some of his Back Benchers thought that we experience problems with tourism in Scotland because of the number of midges. Obviously, Labour Back Benchers must have seen the plague of midges increase this year, as the tourist board figures show a drop in the number of tourists coming to Scotland. However, people who are more in tune with the realities of delivering tourism know that the exchange rate and its stability have more affect on whether foreigners visit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of money that flows into our rural economies through agriculture and the food processing industry is affected not only by loss of subsidies caused by the differential with the euro, but also by the world trade environment and the fact that a high pound makes exportation more difficult in general. Some of the rhetoric that has been used about the matter, especially by the Conservative party, has an inherent danger. It is dangerous continually to say that the problem is a low euro and not a high pound.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
As the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, pointed out, the fact that the pound shadowed the dollar for a prolonged period when our economies did not grow at the same rate shows that we were suffering the problem of a high pound in the world market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to a third sector to whose importance the Government and the Department of Trade and Industry have begun to wake up. Investment in the oil industry is made in dollars, so the exchange rate with the dollar is as important as that with the euro for investment in Scotland. The Secretary of State's comments are to be welcomed to the extent that his Department has begun to recognise problems that the Treasury took a lot longer to acknowledge and which are significant to our economy as they affect the oil industry. Will he build on the work that is being undertaken by Grampian and Scottish Enterprise to invest in creating an export market for our oil industry? Will he explore with his Department the possibility of creating in Scotland a centre of excellence for the oil industry? The Government are keen on establishing centres of excellence for key sectors of the economy and on creating a critical mass and bringing it together. The Department for Trade and Industry should have a key role; it should recognise Scotland's place in the oil industry, acknowledge the importance of building on its expertise before local investment is lost and help to ensure that we maintain maximum possible overseas investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken steps to address fairness at work in a growing economy, which is much to be welcomed. However, where are they heading on paid parental leave and, indeed, on parental leave as a whole? The Liberal Democrats recognise the importance to society of parents' involvement with their children's upbringing. It is dangerous for politicians to reduce matters to personal experience, but I must say that I was very lucky to have time with my children when they were born—a time when parents can bond with their children and be involved in their lives. Such involvement can keep one locked into the lives of one's children for the rest of one's time as a father.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many industries, however, people cannot take vast chunks of time out, and that must be recognised. The Scandinavian model of allowing people to build up time credit for parental leave, which they can then use flexibly, is worth considering. Such flexibility can enable people to avoid damaging their employment potential—perhaps by ensuring that they do not miss out on training opportunities—but still allow them spend time in the crucial role of being a parent and bringing up the next generation. Should not society have a role in the funding package of parental leave? In the long run, society benefits if the next generation is cared for properly and is given the best start in life on which to build.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends hope later to mention age discrimination, the new deal and associated problems. I should like, however, to mention another issue that has come to light in Scotland in respect of "Fairness at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
work"—the problem facing single-person companies on the new tax regime being introduced under IR35. The Government are keen to close tax loopholes, but it is important for the Department of Trade and Industry to make the Treasury aware of new, flexible ways of working. Such working methods have evolved in many industries, such as the information technology industry and—more relevant in Scotland—the oil industry. Providing services by contract rather than through permanent employment is a new way of working. There is great danger in the Government's intransigent attitude towards acknowledging expenses associated with such working methods and their implications for job security. They should not risk damaging the economics of our industry and the personal well-being of people who have been forced by the dynamic of their industry to work in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the key point: if, as a society, we cannot address openly and effectively the future of our currency and its place in the euro, we will undermine the potential for wealth and investment in this country. As the chairman of CBI Scotland said in a recent article in Glasgow's 	<i>The Herald,</i> we might be seeing growth in manufacturing output, but that is survival growth due to people eking out as best they can to compete in a world in which the currency rate does not fully reflect production costs. Such growth comes at the expense of long-term investment and at the great expense of risk to the supply chain. Attracting a major inward investor to this country and locking it in is all very well. However, if that company found that it wanted to source supplies from overseas because of uncertainty regarding our currency, our economy would not gain the maximum benefit of the inward investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman—the honourable admiral—for giving way. I have listened with interest to everything that he has had to say, but all he has done is moan and complain. I draw to his attention the fact that, of all the constituencies in Scotland, his has the lowest unemployment. Surely the Labour Government is working for his constituency, despite everything that he has said, if that is and continues to be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Liberal Democrats wish to speak for the whole of Scotland and not just for parts of the country. There might hopefully be a lesson in the fact that the problems faced by north-east of Scotland are being raised because of the rejection of Labour in rural areas of that region. The hon. Gentleman cannot say that Scotland has no problems just because one constituency has low unemployment. If my constituency has low unemployment at the moment, that does not mean that the people there are not facing challenges or that the unemployed are not facing real challenges of social exclusions. Such people do not have a network on which to build.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) should recognise the problems in rural communities. The young and the unemployed leave such areas—they cannot stay and live there as affordable housing becomes a problem. They move to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
the city to find jobs. Unemployment figures do not necessarily reflect the challenges of a rural economy and do not affect the country's future potential to build on the experiences of that economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must recognise that what matters is Scotland's economy and its future, including the maintenance of future jobs. If employed people from my constituency have to commute all over the world to sustain their employment, they will eventually leave the north-east. Their spending power will be lost to the region, and so will other jobs. If we do not recognise the importance of our oil industry's export potential and agriculture's underpinning of the economy of both the north-east and Scotland as a whole, we fail to recognise two of our great assets for future employment in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the wider economic climate and the currency problem. When the newly elected Mayor of London was asked whether the Government were divided on the pound, he answered that they were divided not on the future of the pound but on when to tell the people what they wanted to say on the issue. The legacy of the previous Government and the current behaviour of the Conservative party present serious challenges. They created the euro. They should never have agreed to its existence if they thought that it was such a bad thing. Its existence is a legacy of a Conservative Government and we must live with it. We no longer have a choice about whether there should be a single currency—instead, we must choose the way in which we relate to it. That would challenge a Conservative Government and a future economy under them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one considers the positions of the Government and the Opposition—the official policies rather than the spin and presentation—the difference between them is a matter of four years. The Government do not want to decide until early in the next Parliament, and the Opposition's line is that they do not want to decide until the end of the next Parliament. Most Parliaments last about four years. Fundamentally, neither party is willing to go to the extreme of saying either that we must go in or that we must stay out. That the Conservatives are so unwilling to go further in their official policy shows that they recognise that a challenge faces the country, and that it must eventually be met if we are to sustain long-term stability for investment in our economy. The Government must take the challenge to the fore, which is why I welcome the Prime Minister's more forthright outbursts during last week's "Question Time", when he began to tell the public some of the hard facts about reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strong emotional and personal ties that keep us from wanting to embrace the need for change must be recognised. Several business representatives have said to me, "My heart tells me that I do not want the euro, that I do not want that change, that I do not want to feel a loss of identity; but my head tells me that my business needs us to take that plunge and to make that decision." It is a one-way decision. It is our one chance to be emphatic. If we join we can secure stability for

our economy; if we decide not to, there will always be instability and a question mark over this country's currency and the future of its economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Those who know my background as a trade union official will not be surprised to hear that I want to dwell on employment rights, which are vital not only because they give people opportunity in the workplace but because they give them dignity. It is important to demonstrate the difficulties that used to exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MRS. IRENE ADAMS 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>I remember being in my Motherwell office, eating sandwiches as trade union officials do, when a young lady asked to speak to me. She told me about a factory in Lanarkshire that employed more than 250 people. She said that conditions in that plant were dreadful, that fire exit doors were blocked and that the people who worked the night shift found themselves locked into the factory. The wages were about £2.50 an hour. The minimum wage was introduced to protect such people.</p>
	<p>We organised the union there, but because people were terrified to join, we had to go to the plant to offer application forms to the employees. A total of 252 people joined the union. Within two days, the employer had dismissed 44, including the four shop stewards elected by the work force. That led to a bitter strike, which lasted for six months. The young men and ladies on the picket line during the winter months were unable to return to work. The way in which they were treated under the previous Tory Administration was absolutely disgusting. We should not forget that the present trade union and employment rights were created by successive Tory Governments. Anyone who believes that there is no difference between the present Government, which has adopted Tory changes in legislation, and the previous Administration lives in a different world from me.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
	<p>The union was also involved in a factory in Cumbernauld. It was another long-established factory with 45 employees, some of whom had been there for 25 years. We found a new employer and manager there, who were attacking people's wages and conditions. Again, employees were paid off with no recourse to industrial tribunals. Those who tell me that the national minimum wage is not making a difference should consider what happened previously.</p>
	<p>We have seen tremendous changes in how people are treated by tribunals in cases of unfair dismissal. Even after workers had been through the tortuous process of a legitimate ballot, they were left with no protection. After an official ballot, there is now an eight-week period during which people cannot be dismissed. We should consider, as a matter for the future, the cancellation of contracts of employment when people are on strike. Why do multinational companies declaring redundancies often pick employees in this country as a soft target? It is because of low redundancy and employment payments. The Secretary of State must consider future development of legislation in terms of dignity and increased protection for those who need it most. If that can be achieved, trade unionists will know why they support a Labour Government.</p>
	<p>12.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for calling me, Mrs. Adams. It is a pleasure to speak in the Grand Committee and to welcome the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. If my memory serves me rightly, the last time we engaged in direct debate was on "Any Questions" in a village hall in Morpeth. It is therefore a pleasure to see him in Glasgow today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan) said, it is fair to acknowledge that the Government inherited an appalling industrial relations climate from the Conservatives. Collaboration was absent after 18 years of industrial tension created by Conservative Governments, and fundamentally premeditated. Their economic policies, which thrived on the use of unemployment as a tool of economic management, created a difficulty for the Government to address. It would be churlish not to recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have introduced a number of initiatives to try to tackle those problems, which were recounted in the White Paper published by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998. A large number of measures were implemented in subsequent legislation, and we have supported and actively encouraged them. We welcomed the extension of maternity leave to 18 weeks, but I encourage the Government to examine whether paid leave can be introduced to overcome the limitations of statutory maternity pay that still affect people on low incomes. I would welcome implementation of the parental leave directive. As the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) said, I would inquire whether the Government propose to introduce paid leave under the directive, which would benefit those who take up such opportunities. The part-time

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
working directive has extended rights to part-time workers on pay, holiday entitlement, regulations and tribunals for part-time workers. Again, those measures are welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect of the "Fairness at Work" proposals is the national child care strategy. Clearly, that has a significant overlap with the activities of the Scottish Parliament and Executive, which determine many such issues. There is an important interplay between the reserved and devolved areas. With regard to the national child care strategy, dependence on new opportunities fund support should be investigated in relation to reserved areas. We have a legitimate interest in inquiring what will follow when that support dries up so that we can guarantee that provision can be sustained as the economy requires. The acute issue of how the national child care strategy applies in rural areas is also important. The strategy should be implemented in the rural environment as well as the urban one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national minimum wage has already been mentioned, and we support its implementation. It is incumbent on the Government to ensure that it continues to command a value that makes a difference to people who depend on the protection that it offers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the people of Scotland will be interested to hear that the Scottish National party supports the minimum wage. Could the hon. Gentleman explain to the people, and to the members of the Committee, why not a single member of the Scottish National party turned up to vote for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) that on Second Reading on 16 December—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman can contain himself, I will with pleasure answer the hon. Member for Dundee, West. Five of my six colleagues attended the Second Reading debate to vote for the principle of the national minimum wage legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan) was a member of the Committee that considered the Bill. I commend the Secy of State for Scotland for having been present at the Second Reading vote, but the Minister of State for the Scottish Office was absent—as was the Prime Minister, the First Minister of the Scottish Parliament and 50 per cent. of Labour representatives in the Westminster Parliament. That may put that issue to rest for the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We offer a fair wind to the working families tax credit, which has again been raised. I support the points made by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) that in implementing that tax credit we must be careful to ensure that we do not create a poverty trap for those in employment by adversely affecting the payment of other benefits or entitlements to individuals. A novel initiative, pioneered by Angus council—one of the councils in my constituency, and one run by an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
enlightened, forward-looking political party called the Scottish National party—is the development, in consort with the Scottish low pay unit, of a software proposal, in the form of a calculator, which has been applied to the council's employees and others in the community to determine their working families tax credit entitlement. Among the people who have used it, being able to determine their own entitlement has already resulted in increased support of more than £300,000. I hope that the Minister will say what the Government intend to do to tackle serious challenges on age discrimination in the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will not be surprised to know that I shall say more about employment. I was surprised when an extract from a Government brief landed on my desk this morning headed
	<br><q><p>Defensive Points on the Economy,</p></q>
and asking whether
	<br><q><p>recent figures show ILO unemployment rising and employment falling in Scotland?</p></q>
That makes the point that I made earlier to the Secretary of State; we must look at all the information in the round to ensure that we are making appropriate judgments about the condition and health of the economy. The latest unemployment statistics, based on figures produced by the International Labour Organisation, show that while joblessness in the UK fell in the quarter from February to April, it rose by 10,000 in Scotland and stands at 192,000. In addition, since the Government came to power, 47,000 jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector, down from 391,000 to 344,000 jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said about a manufacturing action committee and the dialogue that will occur between the different Administrations in the United Kingdom. People in Scotland are looking for action, not talk, from the Government. The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in the Scottish Parliament, the hon. Member for Central Fife (Mr. McLeish), has launched a manufacturing strategy, which is supposed to have taken forward all the manufacturing initiatives—however, we still face a worrying loss of manufacturing employment. The Secretary of State did not deal adequately with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) about the comments of Mr. Andrew Fraser, a civil servant, on the prospect of continuing manufacturing meltdown if the Government do not more forcefully address the currency situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many problems derive from the level of interest rates. Interest has been set at a level higher than is required in Scotland. It may be appropriate for conditions in south-east England but according to the accountancy firm Chantry Vellacott, it is set at a level inappropriate to the needs of the Scottish economy. It said in its February report that interest rates set for Scottish conditions would be far closer to the euro rate than to the Bank of England's base rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I heard that the Secretary of State would be here today, I thought that we had found a purpose for the Scottish Grand Committee. I thought that he would contribute to the debate, and that the Scottish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
Members who are Ministers—the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Foreign Secretary and the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe—could all contribute too. They have all made interesting and often contradictory statements. One can barely read any newspaper without finding that a Minister is being slapped down for something to do with the euro, or another Minister is putting the record straight. We need absolute clarity from the Government about their strategy, and a much clearer suggestion that they intend to take a positive stance on the issue to give the economy the direction that it requires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would clarify the position of the Scottish National party on the euro. Is he saying that, to retain the flexibility of appropriate interest rates for Scotland, his party would not favour our joining the euro?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our position is clear. It was endorsed by our national council meeting at the start of June. Our policy position is to support membership of the single European currency as soon as it is practically possible. That is in line and in tune with the needs and requirements of the Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Alexander 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was with a certain irony that I listened to the hon. Gentleman's description of the SNP's policy as a model of clarity, given his interview to the Bridge news service several days before the Scottish Parliament elections. In it, he discussed the importance of sterling to the SNP's economic policy. I would be obliged if he would enlighten us as to the relative rules of Euroland and the sterling area, so far as the SNP's macro-economic policy is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had Dreadnoughts from the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine and the view from the bridge from the hon. Member for Paisley, South. Neither was especially enlightening. I have set out the SNP's policy position, which is to enter the European single currency as soon as is practically possible. Clarity of direction is required from the Government. No amount of dodging from various Ministers with various interpretations will achieve the climate of opinion required in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine was correct to say that we have a problem not with an undervalued euro, but with a pound overvalued in relation to other currencies. Our community faces problems in agriculture and manufacturing. In addition, the Scottish tourist board produced a damning report on Friday—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not going to give way. Hon. Members should resume their seats quickly when speakers make it clear that they shall not give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is essential that the Government should give clear direction to the key sectors of the economy in which real damage is being done because of UK policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to show some respect for the Chair, which is more than has been done by countless Labour Members, I shall draw to a close by covering an issue implicit in the "Fairness at work" agenda. It is about the fairness of getting to work. We hear much from the Government about their holistic approach, and about joined-up government, but since Labour came to power, petrol prices in our community have risen by 39 per cent. The Chancellor's mark-up on every gallon of petrol sold is 333 per cent., compared to a tax mark-up on alcohol of between 40 per cent. and 100 per cent., and a mark-up of 15 per cent. on luxury goods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne Begg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be interested to hear by exactly how much the SNP proposes to reduce fuel duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have said that we shall freeze fuel duty. That is our clear policy commitment. Hon. Members have obviously not been reading the newspapers. We oppose the damage done to the Scottish economy by the Chancellor of the Exchequer's irresponsible policy of taking a vast amount from motorists and prejudicing the interests of rural communities in a variety of different ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an incredibly important policy statement. The hon. Gentleman's colleagues are going around Scotland saying that they would cut the price of petrol, but the hon. Gentleman clearly says that they would not. He says that they would freeze the price of petrol. Does he mean freezing it in real terms or not linking it to inflation? The fuel duty escalator has, of course, been abolished. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is steering well clear of the subject of the debate. Hon. Members must try to stay in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Adams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to clarify another point. The budget on which the nationalists fought the elections last year was based entirely on retaining the fuel duty escalator until 2003-04. In view of today's statement, how will they fill that gap?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are steering very wide of the subject under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State for Scotland, is not only going wide. He is wrong. The SNP's position is to freeze fuel duty and to have no link with inflation. All the other arguments that the Minister of State for Scotland advances show that he does not understand the depth of the difficulty that he is imposing on the Scottish economy or the damage that he is doing to the rural economy, Scottish business and Scottish communities. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister laughs. He does not care about what is being done to school bus services, emergency services and countless sectors of

the economy. He is damaging all the key services in our community, and he does not understand the damage that he is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy has resulted in the highest priced petrol in Europe. They apply the highest rate of tax on petrol in Europe. The policy is indiscriminate, and it undermines both the Government's ability to get people anywhere near their work, and the Government's fairness at work agenda, because it enables the Government to remove money from the economy and put it in the Chancellor's coffers, without properly investing in the heart of the Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. John Reid)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an attempt to stop such barracking. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman understood what an important statement he made about two minutes ago. Will he repeat that he has publicly pledged not to reduce or even freeze fuel prices but to freeze tax, which means that he has publicly pledged to accept increases in fuel? The only thing that he is talking about freezing is, as he said earlier, tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aspect that the Government control is tax. The commitment that I have given is that we shall freeze fuel duty and that there will be no link to inflation. If the Secretary of State for Scotland understands economics, he will realise that that means that price and duty will decrease in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must draw my remarks to a close. The debate is about the Government's fairness at work agenda. Some measures that the Government have introduced are sensible and progressive, but others are hugely damaging to Scotland's economy, and they must face up to their responsibilities in the ensuing debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.24 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to bring the debate back to the subject under discussion. I am sure that in summing up my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Scotland will deal with the comments of the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney). However, it would be wrong to forget the contribution of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in coming to the Committee and bringing the good news in which people in Scotland have shared along with working men and women and people who have been out of work throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the list of achievements in introducing fairness at work, my right hon. Friend referred to the Government's efforts to get people into work. We have a Labour Government who have almost eradicated youth unemployment and are pushing to create employment for all who wish it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend dealt with the alleged discrepancy between the claimant count and the ILO count mentioned by the SNP. I sat on the Select Committee on Employment for many years and we always argued against the specific use of the claimant count by the previous Government. I argued that the ILO figures were important because they demonstrated the apparent willingness of people who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
wished to work. The previous Government rubbished those sentiments and said that they were just pretend figures for people who did not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact was that millions of people in this country wanted to work but did not feel that the conditions were right. They may have been unemployed for a lengthy period and required retraining; they may have been elderly people who were being discarded from the job market or single parents who were desperate to get back to work but were prevented from doing so by the lack of child care and training. The ILO figures are important but we also need to recognise that the claimant count figures—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Begg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend also add that, thanks to the Government, a large number of disabled people now feel that they have not been written off by society and are desperately seeking work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. I was fortunate to be allowed to chair an inquiry for the Employment Committee into the working of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944, 50 years after its introduction. We looked at it because, although the then Government did not accept it, we believed that that many people with a disability wanted to enter the job market but could not because of physical barriers as well as the barriers they perceived because they felt that they were not wanted in society itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember going with the Select Committee to America to look at its approach. Under the American constitution everyone is equal and therefore has the right to expect to be able to work. Our report recommended that approach. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) is right. The Government have tackled every issue where people have wanted to work but were denied the chance by the last Government. That is why I was so disappointed by the contribution from the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney). Not only did he fail to explain why no member of his party turned up to vote for the minimum wage, but he never mentioned the new deal that has helped many people to get the training they needed to get back into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like me, the hon. Gentleman lives in an area, Tayside, which has an innovative team working to reduce unemployment figures. As I said earlier, long-term youth unemployment has been almost eradicated. I asked Bob Alexander, the Employment Service manager in Tayside, for the figures for Tayside. The percentages of his clients who have remained in jobs for three months is 72 per cent. in Angus; 71 per cent. in Dundee East; 74 per cent. in Dundee West; 75 per cent. in North Tayside, and 72 per cent. in Perth. That may be why the hon. Gentleman did not mention them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the reduction in 18 to 24-year-olds unemployed for six months or more between April 1998 and April 2000, the figures are 57 per cent. for Angus, which has an SNP Member; 56 per cent. for Dundee East; 70 per cent for Dundee West; 60 per cent. for North Tayside and 78 per cent. for Perth. I am sure that the hon. Member for Perth
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
(Ms Cunningham), who is sitting right behind the hon. Member for North Tayside, will be interested to know that only 28 young people in Perth have been unemployed for six months. There is a series of good news stories from Tayside that the hon. Member for North Tayside could have cited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend seeks the reason why the hon. Gentleman did not mention this tremendous progress in reducing long-term youth unemployment. He might find it in the 1999 manifesto for the Scottish elections in which the SNP dishonestly described the new deal as
	<br><q><p>a scheme of workfare for the young unemployed that has little impact on unemployment, and even less on the issue of providing real jobs or real wages.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised, given that the SNP will say one thing in Dundee, another in Angus and another in Kilmarnock and Loudoun. They could have dwelt on the good news stories from Tayside. A client in Perth in the 18–24 age group, who had been unemployed for 20 months while on the full-time education and training option, was referred by his new deal personal adviser to a Ministry of Defence vacancy at Cullybraggan army camp. He started work on 26 June.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not understand that, in a constituency such as mine, when young people get into difficulties with work they simply leave and go elsewhere. That is why they are not on the register there. I have a constituency with a rising age demographic. If he knows anything at all about the other constituencies in Tayside he will know that that is a fact. It is an ageing constituency and young people are leaving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The SNP does not want to admit how successful the new programme has been. The hon. Gentleman could have told us about the lone parent from Angus who had been unemployed for 10 years, has two daughters and had great difficulty in finding work because of restricted travel in that rural area. The lone parent adviser worked with the client and employers to find suitable hours that would also link with travel times. The client started work on 4 June as a domestic and is thrilled at being back at work and £54 a week better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members should not just believe us. I am sure that they will recognise the document that comes from the new deal in Tayside, in which employers say that they can see the benefits for themselves of those services. That is why I am really disappointed that the hon. Member for North Tayside did not take the opportunity to welcome the programme. It has not only dealt with people who find it difficult to get into work, but in Perth itself there is a programme to help those who are in jail. As part of their rehabilitation and to prevent recidivism they are being prepared for jobs on their release. The hon. Member for Perth might have mentioned that too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
The fact that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is here today reminds us of some of the achievements that our Government have brought to the people of the United Kingdom. It was appropriate that he should follow the first class statement of the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development about the role that the people of Scotland are playing to help people outside Scotland. I am disappointed that the major Opposition parties did not take the opportunity to support what the Government are doing in a much more positive way. I hope that when they look at what they said they will regret not taking the opportunity to tell the people of Scotland that there is a good news story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman and other Labour Members will not think that I am abusing the debate if I do not focus on good news. The self-congratulatory approach of Labour Members rather misses the opportunity to focus on what needs to be done. Even with the most sanguine view of the Scottish economy today, there are extremely black spots in the textile industry, in tourism and agriculture, on which the Opposition have sought to focus. To draw attention to those things does not gloss over the good news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My neighbour in Caithness, a farmer of 35 years standing and a close friend, shot himself dead because of the sharp decline in his income. I attended a meeting of the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution in Wick at Christmas at which hard-pressed farmers looked for charitable ways to help the farming community. At the table at which I dined, four of the six farmers had made no profit for three years. The hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) should therefore be less sanctimonious in preaching to the Liberal Democrats about the good news. Some of us live with bad news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately, the Secretary of State was not so glib. We are grateful to him for coming, because he has brought some badly needed realism to the debate. That is a useful injection into the Committee's deliberations. I was particularly interested in his comments on the Government's policy on the euro, although it is true that he did not add to what has been said before. I was particularly interested in discovering in which direction he would lean, not on the substance, but on the two issues that remain outstanding. The Secretary of State said that the Government's view was that we should join the euro, if the conditions were right and if it were good for the economy at the time. Who will decide whether the conditions are right, and when will such a decision be taken?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one reads the language carefully, it is clear that several senior Ministers take different views about the right time. There is some uncertainty about whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer should have the sole right of decision. That decision will be critical for employment prospects in Scotland. I hope that, in

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
winding up, we will hear some reversion to the notion of collective Cabinet responsibility, which seems to be singularly lacking from the Government's thinking on the euro. The Chancellor has no right to prescribe the time for the British people. My party is committed to holding a referendum on the issue, and I had understood that the last word would rest with the British people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now focus on matters relating to the departmental responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Perhaps it is not surprising for one who has declared his intention not to seek reelection to focus on the predicament of the aged. I do not regard myself yet as falling into that category, but I have some sympathy for the plight of those who feel that they are to some extent discriminated against in the workplace and who are suffering from exclusion and greater difficulties in finding jobs than other sections of the community. I recognise and gladly acknowledge all that the Government have done to reform employment law and introduce legislation on worker's rights since 1997, but their policy towards the aged has disappointed me, even judged against their own promises in opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The then shadow employment spokesman, now the Minister of State, Cabinet Office said:
	<br><q><p>The Labour party's position is quite clear…an incoming Labour Government will introduce comprehensive legislation to make age discrimination in employment illegal.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 February 1996; Vol. 271, c. 618.]</p></q>
No such legislation has been introduced. Instead, a statutory code of good practice has been provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would prefer not to, given the time. I am sorry, but the hon. Lady has already intervened in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presented a private Member's Bill to outlaw age discrimination in the 1998–99 Session. An early-day motion highlighting the problem has been signed by 109 Members of Parliament, and campaigning groups, such as Equal Rights on Age, continue to press for stronger measures to combat such prejudice in the workplace. People are living longer and remaining healthier for longer. Many wish to work beyond the usual retirement ages of 60 or 65, and they should be able to do so. Employers should recognise that there is no cut-off point at which people cease to be useful employees. However, the problem of age discrimination runs deeper than that. Fewer people than ever before are in employment when they reach state pension age. The Cabinet Office published a useful and revealing report called "Winning the Generation Game". It says that one third of people aged 50 to 65 are not working—a total of 2.8 million people in the UK. Unemployment among men in that age group has doubled since 1979, rendering 800,000 more men workless. If unemployment rates remain the same for the over-50s, by 2020 another 800,000 people will have become workless before the age of 65.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Early retirement may sound attractive, in theory, to many of us. If people can retire and live full and relatively prosperous lives, there is no reason why they should not do so. However, the Cabinet Office report goes on to argue that
	<br><q><p>it is not safe to assume that any more than one-third of the increase in worklessness in this age group is due to fully voluntary early retirement.</p></q>
Many people are simply not choosing to cash in their pension schemes early and sit in the sun. That is reflected by the fact that almost half the workless 50 to 65-year-olds rely on benefits for most of their income. The paper estimates that that level of premature worklessness costs the economy as much as £16 billion a year in lost output, and damages the public purse, through costs of benefit and lost revenue, by £3 billion to £5 billion annually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems clear that the loss of income, with its attendant poverty and the loss of self-esteem that can accompany a person's premature exit from the work force, can lead to health problems. It has been suggested that the middle-aged man who loses his job doubles his chance of dying within the next five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are committed to building an inclusive society and delivering fairness at work, we must tackle the problem of age discrimination. It is costing individuals and families dear, and punishing the economy and the public purse. The reasons for age discrimination are clear. It has been due partly to the downsizing and restructuring of firms over the past decade and partly to technological change, ending the prospects of jobs for life. As people have been forced out of jobs, as has always been the case, they have found that they lack the skills to move on to new employment. Two thirds of workless men in the age group 50 to 65 had been in the same job for 10 years before becoming unemployed. Two thirds of all workless 50 to 65-year-olds had no post-compulsory education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time has therefore come for the Government to recognise the weakness of their response and that of Parliament. It is necessary positively to end age discrimination. I remind the Minister that the Cabinet Office paper stated that
	<br><q><p>age discrimination legislation would have a positive effect on British culture…the absence of legislation on age, when it exists for gender, race, and disability, sends a powerful message that age discrimination is taken less seriously.</p></q>
Opinion among business people is also clearly moving. An NOP poll in June 1999 of 500 members of the Institute of Directors found 63 per cent. in favour of legislation. A 1996 survey of 1,700 members of the Institute of Management found 85 per cent. in favour of anti-age discrimination legislation. Incidentally, that is not entirely surprising, because unemployment is just as common among managers as others at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his preface to the Cabinet Office document, the Prime Minister stated that he and the rest of the Government accept its conclusions. I hope that there will be a statement on anti-age discrimination legislation soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disability is another sphere in which more needs to be done. The Government have a record of taking important steps, but a lot remains to be done. The November 1999 report of the Education and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
Employment Committee, called "Opportunities for Disabled People", concluded that whatever the source of the data and whatever the definition of disability used, the picture that emerges is one of extreme disadvantage for disabled people. The report revealed that 6.2 million people in the United Kingdom are disabled and of working age. That is 18 per cent. of the total working population. That is not good news and has not yet been completely taken on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not pretend that it is not difficult to tackle what I have outlined, or that the problem will disappear overnight. Disabled people who are economically active are twice as likely to be unemployed as non-disabled people. More than a million disabled people who are economically inactive—neither seeking nor considered presently available for work—would like to work. Disabled people of all ages are twice as likely as their able-bodied contemporaries to have no educational qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the shortness of the debate I conclude by drawing the Secretary of State's attention to a particularly interesting development at the North Highland college in my constituency. A specialist recruitment agency there, called Jobs 4 All, is established as a self-sustaining unit providing helpful advice, profiling for individuals, systematic instruction, personal development plans, job matching, skills audits, market research, teleworking functions, information on supported employment and training at national quality standards. That agency has been running only since 3 September 1998. A Minister has visited it and it continues to show great strength in helping to overcome the attitudes and prejudices of those at work. It enjoys massive co-operation from local industry, including a local firm that has placed disabled people on its training programme, taking them from college into the factory, on the electricity production line. That kind of work is breaking down the perception that disabled people are not capable, as employees, of giving service as good as that provided by others who are more fortunate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, North and Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All parties here must acknowledge the increasing number of jobs in Scotland—indeed, the highest number since my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's team won the world cup—and the great advances in wages and workplace conditions. Of course there is a long way to go and there have been difficulties with the high pound and the low euro, but we should celebrate the advances and keep a sense of perspective. Export volumes surged by 12 per cent. last year—the biggest increase in 20 years. That, in addition to the gains in productivity, will put us in a strong position once the euro and the pound begin to converge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard from the SNP the usual mantra about interest rates set for the south-east of England. The reality is that there are different economies in England, just as in Scotland. The SNP did not suggest how to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
achieve lower interest rates—or how it would bring them about if it achieved independence. I note that, in its economic strategy of last April, the party did
	<br><q><p>not anticipate that there will be any advantage to setting up a distinct Scottish currency</p></q>
in the context of independence, with the United Kingdom not in the euro; that is, with interest rates set by the Bank of England, without any influence in the relevant area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak about family-friendly employment, or work-life balance, as it is now called, but as I have only one minute I shall have to be brief. We must welcome the new emphasis on family-friendly employment, as I still prefer to call it. On the one hand we have had more emphasis on time off; parental leave is the main advance, but maternity leave has also been improved. On the other hand, emphasis has been placed on more flexible patterns of work, such as part-time, flexitime, job-share and term-time working. I know that my right hon. Friend from the Department of Trade and Industry is chairing a review group on work-life balance. We hope that substantial advances will be made. Perhaps my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland will let us know what progress has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the minimum wage and the working families tax credit are also important for family-friendly work. People do not have to work such long hours because they are no longer on poverty pay. The Government have driven forward their agendas on that and on social justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.50 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. John Reid)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate. The breadth and quality of the contributions of the Scottish Grand Committee increasingly justify our sittings. I am especially glad that we have had one during the Scottish parliamentary recess. Although I have limited time in which to respond to the debate—I have allowed hon. Members to make their contributions—I shall try to answer as many questions as possible and to make a couple of general points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith), who speaks for what must be the official Opposition in Scotland, raised a number of points. One or two—tourism and agriculture—were repeated by other hon. Members, including his colleagues in the Liberal party. Tourism was mentioned at the weekend by my hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife (Mr. McLeish) in the wake of recent figures on it. As several hon. Members made clear, the bottom line is that there are difficult problems to overcome, even in the context of a Scottish economy that appears to be doing well. I would be the first to concede that that is the case with agriculture. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ross Finnie and I recently held a summit on the problem. Indeed, the matter has gone as far as the Prime Minister. We have tried to provide finances to ease the transition period. However, no one would believe that Scottish or, indeed, British agriculture has a future without
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
tremendous challenges. No amount of money will alleviate the challenge that the people in agriculture and the food industry face in their efforts to modernise and restructure. We are not unaware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members also asked for more to be done about parental leave. The Government do not claim that they have done everything that they possibly could, but we have made significant progress on that and other matters. However, although much has been done, much more remains to be done—I am glad that that sound bite commands the universal support of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides referred to the euro. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Department of Trade and Industry could not have made the situation clearer. I shall not repeat the formula lest I mistakenly insert a comma and put the story on the front page. However, I have no doubt that the SNP Members will make their position clear when it is practicable for them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly pleased with the contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan). He has tremendous experience in implementing decent fairness at work proposals under the Tory Government. I take it as praise indeed that, although be believes there is much to be done, he commends what the Labour Government have done to improve fairness at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recurrent feature was age discrimination in employment. Although we recognise that more could be done, there is a code of practice that is directed at age and employment. The Government strongly support that code. However, we have extended the new deal, which was so successful for younger people, to people over 50. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Scotland has taken a considerable interest that and has launched an initiative in Scotland. As for the examples of individual groups, I agree that there are problems in rural areas and challenges for lone parents, which were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West. Again, we have extended the creative and advisory aspects of the new deal to include lone parents. I, too, have met many people who have benefited tremendously from the Government's initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps inadvertently the most sensational news announcement of the whole Grand Committee, which probably justifies holding it, was the clarification by the SNP spokesman, the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney), on the new policy on fuel prices. I was astonished. The issue is, as he has been telling us for months, relevant to the creation of employment. After promises made all round the country to reduce fuel prices, he today publicly announced the abandonment of that policy. He twice repeated that it was not his party's policy to reduce fuel prices, but merely to freeze fuel duty. First, that is not a reduction and, secondly, he may be interested to know that fuel duty accounted for only 2p in respect of the past 19 increases. Today he has not only announced the reversal of his party's policy and declared that it will not cut fuel prices; he has effectively declared that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
as far as the SNP is concerned, fuel prices will continue to rise. I think that that statement will have been marked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people told us, when the Government came to power, that it is always necessary to face a choice between economic competence and social justice. They said that Governments in the past had never been able to combine them. We promised that we would combine them and the record shows that the Government have done so. In the context of today's debate, those who are now absent friends, or at least absent colleagues, the Tories, told us that it would not be possible to combine a minimum wage and an extension of workers' rights with job creation; that pursuing the former would result in high unemployment. The Government have given the lie to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employment in Scotland is now 2.33 million, its highest for 33 years. Unemployment is at its lowest for 24 years. The growth rate has taken us to fourth position with respect to GDP. We have slashed youth unemployment by 70 per cent. in three years. We have halved long-term unemployment, but not at the expense of social justice. We have adopted the European social chapter and extended rights to trade unions—creating for the first time the right to be a member of a trade union in this country. We have given part-time workers the protection that they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
deserve, extended paternity leave and ended blacklisting. Above all, we have given the lie to the Tory myths by introducing for the first time in Scottish or British history, a decent minimum wage to combat poverty pay. The Tories could not bring themselves to support a measure—indeed, they opposed it—that has helped many more than 190,000 people in Scotland. The fact that SNP Members could not stay out of their beds and vote for a minimum wage is a measure of their commitment to social justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish economy is stronger than at any time in two generations, and employment levels are matched by low inflation. Despite hon. Members' comments, and the challenges faced in manufacturing, more jobs are being created than are being lost. Growth in manufacturing last year increased to 1.9 per cent., and growth in manufacturing exports is running at about 6 per cent., despite the challenges of the weak euro. We have combined that with decency and fairness at work. The real value in this country is created by working people, who have a right to be protected and to take part in the strong economy that the Government are creating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee now adjourn.—[	<i>Mrs. McGuire.</i>]</p>
	<p>1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have secured this Adjournment debate to discuss employment initiatives in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I congratulate the Government on what they have achieved, nationally and locally, in terms of employment initiatives. As a result of the new deal, youth unemployment in my constituency and many other constituencies in Scotland has undergone a massive reduction: about 70 per cent. in the 18 to 24 age group. In my area, 494 young people have gone into employment—450 into unsubsidised employment and 44 into subsidised employment. Overall, 1,039 have joined the new deal. That should be contrasted with the early 1990s, when the manufacturing economy was haemorrhaging. At that time, 1,000 jobs were lost every year. There are now 10,000 manufacturing jobs in the area, which is fewer than there had been, at one time, in one factory—Singer's in Clydebank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to deal with that legacy. As a result, we have experienced the classic symptoms of multiple deprivation. My area has comparatively high long-term unemployment; indeed, it is the second highest in Scotland after inner-city Glasgow. We have a low skills base. A national report that was published a couple of weeks ago indicated that west Dunbartonshire had the second lowest self-employment generation in the United Kingdom. In addition to those problems, the physical fabric of the town centres in Dumbarton, the Vale of Leven and the Helensburgh area has deteriorated physically. West Dunbartonshire has among the lowest GDP per head in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, more needs to be done. I suggest that more can be achieved through the new deal. I am delighted that the Minister has announced action teams for the area, but money is needed to accompany that. I would suggest that more than £1 million is needed to achieve our aims and objectives. We must ensure, through employment action teams, that there are advisers in the community examining poverty questions and asking people what they need. If a person lacks money, he can obtain a grant. If he lacks confidence and motivation, he can acquire skills through training. As we know, the problem may be literacy and numeracy, as many young people have left school ill-equipped for society and the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a mismatch between labour market arrangements and employers' expectations. In relation to new deal innovation funds, I am pleased to note that the local employment service has won "start right" funds, which allow advisers to go into firms and factories to ensure that employers understand the needs of employees and that they get the induction right. Many young people suffer from a lack of confidence and motivation.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
There has been an overall improvement, and the Government have done extremely well, but Dumbarton has suffered several grievous blows recently, such as that of the J&B whisky bottling plant. I was there when the closure was announced in June 1998, and I am delighted to say that my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Scotland was also there a few short days afterwards. We had to deal with the fact that 450 jobs were removed from our community, which had a local effect. Eighty per cent. of the jobs were held by residents of the Dumbarton and Vale of Leven area, whose age, skills and experience left them vulnerable in the marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures bear witness to that. A third of all managers and 60 per cent. of the manual group had no academic qualifications. Our immediate response was to establish a task force. We had the encouragement of my hon. Friend the Minister in our early meeting after the announcement of the closure. The task force has now been active for two years, and has had many successes outwith and within the plant. We have ensured an induction programme for training for employees, and to date 198 employees have secured Scottish vocational qualifications. We have also involved 40 employees in technical re-training in electrics and mechanics. Fifty-eight employees have had success in further education, mostly higher national certificates, although there have been one or two MBAs. Last but not least, we established a bursary scheme, for which Diageo has been considerate. It is for educational provision for the present work force and their families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been done, the substance of which means that only 100 of the original 450 employees are still looking for jobs. Our task was not easy, but we undertook it because of the partnership. Different people with their own aims and agendas came together and overcame the feeling of betrayal that there was when Diageo announced that it would leave the area. I said at the time that it was a needless sacrifice, as I did not think that it made any strategic sense. Our success in the two years might demonstrate that. Rather than nurse our anger and have a stand-off between the company and the representatives of the community, it was important that we came together to find areas of common ground on which we could forge ahead for the benefit of the work force and the wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did that because of the constructive role of the different partners. I would like to state my appreciation to the trade unions, including three main individuals, John Toal, Tony Davies, and Willie Glover. From day one, they were committed to constructive engagement and, with the work force, delivered that objective magnificently. We witnessed record production levels in the J&B plant only a month or two ago, when 13.3 million cases went through the factory. That was after the work force had been told that there was no future and that there was to be a two-year run-down, which is a great tribute to the trade unions and the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank Diageo. From early days, it saw its corporate responsibility to the work force and to the community. I pay special tribute to Ken Robertson,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
whom my hon. Friend the Minister knows well. Ken has been involved from the start, and has delivered all that he said that he would do, which reflects well on him and the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must thank Scottish Enterprise Dunbartonshire, which has been involved from early on, especially its chief executive, Dave Anderson, and one of its senior directors, Alan McQuaid. The employment service deserves thanks, especially Anne Wilson, who is in charge of it, and David McBride, who was placed in the J&B plant. It had a permanent residence there and gave, on a daily basis, the best advice to the work force on matters concerned with redeployment, retraining or seeking other employment. We also had educational involvement from Clydebank college and its principal Hugh Walker. From day one, we had political leadership from West Dunbartonshire council with the convenor Andy White and the officers Dan Henderson, who is in charge of economic development, and Irvine Hodgson. All those groups worked alongside me and my colleague in the Scottish Parliament, Jackie Baillie. That demonstrated that a local infrastructure could work with political representation at the levels of Westminster and the Scottish Executive. We need to keep that partnership and to realise that there are certain things that Westminster can deliver in tandem with the Scottish Executive, in a constructive engagement. Jackie Baillie and I have done that at a local level and we would like to see it mirrored elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the task force operated for those two years, we have now moved on. The task force has completed its work and we have focused our attention on the plant level. We have established the Strathleven Regeneration Company. It has a massive land bank, with land from Diageo, which put in 100 acres of the J & B site, from West Dunbartonshire council which owns land in the north of the A82 carriageway and from Scottish Enterprise Dunbartonshire, which also owns land there, including the Vale of Leven industrial estate. So we have set up a company that has the sole aim of securing jobs and ensuring economic development on the J & B site and in the wider community. Indeed, economic development experts have predicted that if we get it right we could create 1,000 jobs over a 10-year period. On the J & B site, for instance, we envisage the important development of a technological centre—an area in which we have been poor—to encourage businesses to develop in Dumbarton and surrounding areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need educational provision; there is a dearth of further and higher education provision in the area. We can also create centres of excellence in the developing local industries, for example hotels and tourism. As my hon. Friend knows, we have secured national park status for Loch Lomond, after a long fight that was on the agenda for many years in the Dumbarton area. It will bring great benefits to my area and to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, whose constituency also covers Loch Lomond. We must also anticipate what skills and jobs are needed to get the best out of the national park. The development of Lomond Shores at the south end of Loch Lomond
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
constitutes a £60 million investment. There is no doubt that more hotel, catering and tourism facilities will come into the area but we need the work force to ensure that local people get those local jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister has written to his counterpart in the Scottish Executive, the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, on the matter; I shall quote from that letter because it is extremely important. He says that there is a possibility of a
	<br><q><p>Centre for Tourism & Hospitality Training which identifies options for developing a centre based on international best practice…it is clear that there is potential to develop a centre of excellence within Dunbartonshire not only to serve the training needs of Lomond Shores but also to encourage best practice in training for retail and catering throughout Scotland.</p></q>
So we have broad ambitions for the redevelopment of the J & B site and for the aims and objectives of the Strathleven Regeneration Company. We need assistance and recognition from Government if they are to be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to make several points to my hon. Friend the Minister for consideration by his Department, separately and with the Scottish Executive. As I said, the employment action teams need us to build on the success of the new deal in the area. I would like him to take note of the efforts of all the partners who contributed to the excellent work of the task force, and now the Strathleven Regeneration Company, which is a unique economic development body incorporating the public and private sectors. There needs also to be acknowledgement that much has to be done to tackle the high rates of unemployment that exist in large parts of my constituency. I would also like him to consider whether special initiatives might be introduced to tackle unemployment in my constituency. I should also like appropriate representation to be made to the European Commission so that quick approval can be secured for the west of Scotland objective 2 programme and funds delivered to essential projects in the constituency as quickly as possible.

To realise the aims of the regeneration company and develop the J&B site, we need to encroach to the north of the carriageway. Both north and south, therefore, need to be developed, which will require a new roundabout and European regional development fund money, among other moneys. As I said, the project involves a unique partnership of public and private sectors, and no doubt money will be provided for that new roundabout. Initial estimates are for £7 million. Although some private money will be provided, we need public money and the associated recognition especially quickly. Those to whom I report will be reassured if the matter is given urgency.

I mentioned a letter from my hon. Friend the Minister to my hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife (Mr. McLeish). If action can be taken and progress made on educational resources, we shall produce results. An element of further education provision is necessary. The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council has examined further education
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
provision in Dumbarton, and we must work on that. We expect the J&B site to be an ideal location to ensure extra educational provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have great access from our area to the airport, the transport infrastructure of the A82, the Milton road, needs to be examined. I know that the Scottish Office has considered the matter, but part of the infrastructure is necessary earlier. I realise that the matter falls within the Scottish Executive's remit, but completion of the M74 in Glasgow will enable areas like ours, such as Inverclyde and Paisley, to share in economic prosperity. I know that that big issue is close to your heart, too, Mrs. Adams. We must ensure that we have proper access to our areas to produce a level economic playing field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his contribution and encouragement. As he knows, we have a lengthy and ambitious agenda, because we realise that if we want to get ahead in our area we must do it ourselves. We have shown that we can do that by coming together. The agenda is ready. We need the encouragement and assistance of the Government in both Westminster and Edinburgh, and I look forward to receiving that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Scotland (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) on securing the debate and on the way in which he presented his case. As he acknowledged, I have had some personal contact with many of the problems and opportunities that he describes, and I assure him of my enthusiastic good will in responding as positively as I can to his points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways, my hon. Friend's constituency is almost a mirror image of my own. They lie on different sides of the Clyde, and each has attractive seaside towns with tourism potential and has suffered from declining industries and major closures over the past 20 years or so. I sometimes wish that there had been a closure in my constituency in recent years, as closures provide a dynamic and attract attention to an area, which are lacking when an area has merely been subject to a process of attrition over a long period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the points that my hon. Friend made about the United Distillers and Vintners announcement, made three years ago. As my hon. Friend was good enough to recall, I chaired the meeting that brought people together in the immediate aftermath of the closure announcement. At that meeting, everybody decided to set a positive agenda. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend's role since then in chairing the task force, now known as the Strathleven Regeneration Company. The task force was an extraordinary success, and that is due to my hon. Friend's significant contribution and the hard work done by all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like so much else that is good and has changed since the general election, task forces are often denigrated now. When I was the Minister responsible for industry at the Scottish Office, I was involved in establishing three task forces in response to the only pieces of bad industrial news announced in that year. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
establishment of the task forces was a complete departure from previous responses. If the Tories had still been in power, the response would have been about market forces and commercial decisions, and how the decision had nothing to do with them, but we took the opposite view in response to the British Aerospace announcement at Prestwick, the Mitsubishi announcement at Haddington and the UDV announcement at Dumbarton. We said that progress could be made if everybody worked together, and the approach of each task force was an outstanding success. In each case, bad news was turned into the potential for good news. It is worth recalling how things changed when the Government changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute also to the way in which UDV and its parent company Diageo have conducted themselves. We should all respond more maturely to industrial closures and restructuring. Of course it happens. The Diageo announcement in 1998 contained much good news for Hillington, Fife and Kilmarnock, but bad news for Dumbarton. However, far from walking away from the bad news at that point, Diageo, particularly through Ken Robertson, became involved in all the action being taken to ameliorate the situation and turn it to people's advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statistics are extraordinary. According to the most recent figures, of the 450 employees who lost their jobs, 71 retired—in most cases that would have happened anyway—298 were re-employed, some at other Diageo sites; four are in further education or training; and 69 still seek employment. That situation is different from the one that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton and I faced that night in Dumbarton in the immediate aftermath of the closure announcement. Diageo has strongly supported our efforts to reskill the work force. It provided £400,000 for outplacement activity for more than 400 employees and invested £220,000 to retrain 248 employees. As my hon. Friend said, 198 employees acquired SVQs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those developments took place in parallel to the other economic development activity in the Dumbarton area, in which the Strathleven Regeneration Company is involved. One positive development is the Loch Lomond project, more commonly known as the Lomond Shores development. That is a £60 million project funded by Scottish Enterprise, Dunbartonshire Scottish Enterprise, the Strathclyde European partnership and the private sector. That project aims to form a gateway to the proposed Loch Lomond and Trossachs national park, which will be a major destination for tourists and day-trippers when completed and opened to the public in April 2001. It is estimated that the development will permanently employ more than 500 people on site and generate a further 800 jobs in Balloch and the neighbouring towns, including Helensburgh, Dumbarton and Clydebank. As a result of discussions with my hon. Friend and Ken Robertson about the way in which that could be made to fit in with the role of the J&B building and all the other activities that are taking place, I took up with my hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife the possibility of creating a centre for tourism and hospitality training. That fits in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
with other recent events. Scotland needs not only more but better tourism. It particularly needs a sharp rise in skills training. If developments with much enhanced facilities are created on the Loch Lomond site and elsewhere, which will become an even greater beacon for tourists, we must have the people to provide the skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton described the problems in his constituency. It has a history of high unemployment, particularly in the Vale of Leven, so people do not have the necessary skills. They are not at the level of employability required for new opportunities. Part of any coherent approach must be to raise the skills to that level, so that people can take advantage of the good jobs that are available through all the activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife said, a feasibility study is taking place on a centre for tourism and hospitality training based on best international practice. That is what we need. I look forward to further discussions on that venture and seeing it progress in tandem with the work of the task force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go through all the names and organisations mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton, but I endorse every word that he said. Any community that faces an industrial closure in future should look to the example of Dumbarton and how it has responded. The people, the work force, the company, the local authority and the enterprise company have turned bad news into good and created something sustainable and promising out of what at first appeared to be an extremely negative development for the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has covered the new deal well. More than 1,100 young people in Dunbartonshire have found work through it. New deal 25 plus has enabled nearly 200 long-term unemployed people to find work. There are also success stories regarding the new deal for lone parents and new deal 50 plus, which is under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dunbartonshire has two innovation fund initiatives under the new deal. The Dunbartonshire new deal strategic partnership has been awarded more than £41,000 under the innovation fund for a multi-media package to take information on training and career opportunities in tourism into the wider community. That package is accessed by clients in Alexandria through an IT unit and provides detailed information on the hospitality, leisure and tourism industries. The other innovation initiative in Dunbartonshire—right start—and was introduced to help clients to resolve issues that are a barrier to work. That is all extra assistance for Dunbartonshire under the new deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is first with the news that the East Ayrshire action team pathfinder will be replicated in Dumbarton. I was told that that had not been announced yet, but who cares? That is an enhancement of the new deal and provides extra support in tackling areas of high unemployment and for people who have particular needs in those areas. Through that initiative, we are focusing help on the people who have been out of work longest. That makes good sense,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
because most people leave unemployment quickly, but a hard core do not. That will be a big boost to my hon. Friend's constituency if and when the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry—I had better not formally pre-empt my right hon. Friend—announces the action team pathfinder for Dunbartonshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal more is going on to help people to take up employment in Dunbartonshire. The new futures fund, managed by Scottish Enterprise, has funded four projects designed to help disadvantaged young people to engage or re-engage with the labour market. Many have little or no work experience. The projects include one at Low Moss prison at Bishopbriggs, which involves working to help prisoners as they approach the end of short-term sentences, and the Dumbarton area drug initiative, which is helping young people to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
overcome addiction and barriers to employment and training. The other two projects are the NCH Action for Children, based in Alexandria, and the West Dunbartonshire partnership, which is helping socially excluded young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only matter that I have not mentioned is roundabouts, because they are definitely devolved. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton that I recognise the problems in his constituency and the excellent work being done to deal with them, not least by him. I can assure him that he will receive every assistance from my Department, through its own work and through its contacts with other Departments and the Scottish Executive as it seeks to advance those efforts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
