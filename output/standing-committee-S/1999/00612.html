<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first item of business is a statement on the Government's textile and clothing strategy. There is no time limit for the statement and subsequent questions. I shall decide when to bring the following debate to a close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>National Textiles Strategy</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to make a statement about the United Kingdom textile and clothing strategy announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry last week, and about other issues currently relevant to the industry. Copies of my statement are available on the Table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warmly welcome the Government's 12-point plan to support the British textile industry, which has lacked an overall strategy and adequate support for too long. To pre-empt any question, I can assure hon. Members that I am clad head to toe in garments produced by British textile workers—visibly, and invisibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The textile and clothing industry makes a major contribution to the UK economy. It is our ninth largest manufacturing sector, with a turnover of £18 billion and exports of more than £5 billion. Employment UK-wide is 270,000. In some parts of the country, particularly the east midlands, Yorkshire, the Scottish borders and Northern Ireland, textiles and clothing is the main, if not the sole, manufacturing industry. In the Scottish borders, the textile industry employs more than 4,000 people and accounts for almost 50 per cent. of all manufacturing employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also a diverse industry, producing the clothing and accessories that we see on high streets and catwalks, and traditional fabrics such as linen, Harris tweed, woollens and worsted. It is also responsible for weaving woollen carpets and polypropylene fibres, and for creating products from the finest silks and cashmere, as well as uniforms for civilian and armed forces, and high-tech, bullet-proof fabrics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know the challenges that the industry faces. The global market for textiles is changing rapidly. We know that we cannot, and should not, try to compete on labour costs alone, because many of our competitors pay wages that would be illegal, as well as immoral, in this country. We need to recognise that
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
and build an industry that is less vulnerable to such competition. We need to build on our strengths and capabilities, emphasising such facets as design, branding and the distribution and supply chain mechanism. We succeed when we add value to our products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry can do that by exploiting knowledge and making better use of skills, know-how and talent. We need to create new markets, introduce new processes, invest in new technology and reduce unit costs. We must foster and retain design talent, and adapt to fashion changes. However, let us not run the risk of talking down what already exists. Many segments of the British, and specifically Scottish, textile industry already compete successfully, on the basis of high-quality products and design. Those companies have tended to concentrate on higher-value production. They continue to employ substantial numbers of people and have a bright future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are determined to work with the industry to achieve the necessary competitiveness. It is crucial that we retain the skills of talented people who can make a real difference to the success of the industry. The Government and the private sector must continue to work in partnership to enable our manufacturing industries to adapt and succeed. Nowhere is that message more important than in the textile industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the Department of Trade and Industry last year appointed an industry-led group to take a long-term view of the industry and recommend actions that will improve the sector's competitiveness. That group reported last week, and the Government responded by launching their national strategy for textiles and clothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's 12-point plan will help companies to compete more effectively in the global marketplace. It aims to exploit what is good in the industry and build on the work already taking place in companies, trade associations and academia. It will provide the support that businesses need to move into and grow in overseas markets. We will review its rules on the number of times that firms can attract Government support to attend overseas trade fairs, and British Trade International will provide funding to support better-focused export promotion by the British apparel and textile export advisory group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plan will stimulate the flow of ideas between research departments and business to ensure that we exploit as fully as possible the ideas coming out of universities. I am delighted that the Government will designate a centre of manufacturing excellence in textiles at Heriot Watt university's Galashiels campus. That is a testament to the excellent work and the fine young designers and technicians that the Galashiels college produces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures will also build on, and aim to increase, the number of collaborative projects, which so often lead to innovation in products and processes. Once again, Heriot Watt is involved, joining Leeds university and the university of Manchester institute of science and technology. Those universities will work with the British Textiles Technology Group and up to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
100 firms in a partnership to encourage collaboration among leading universities, research organisations and industry. They will provide co-ordinated programmes of research, education and training that will produce new products and processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plan will also help to improve supply-chain mechanisms and improve skills in the industry. It will build on our excellence in world-class design with the aim of keeping more talent within the United Kingdom. It provides for future discussions with the industry and public procurement agencies about how public procurement decisions can better support British firms. Finally, it will also help those who have lost their jobs to develop new skills and find new employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is only the beginning of the Government's response. The Scotland Office will also work closely with a special unit at the DTI to consider how it can respond positively and quickly to the other recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The textile industry is extremely important to Scotland. Despite the decline in recent years, in 1997—the most recent year for which we have comprehensive figures—textiles was still the fourth largest manufacturing sector in Scotland. It employed about 30,000 people and accounted for more than 10 per cent. of manufacturing jobs in Scotland. It is estimated that every 100 jobs created directly by the industry support an additional 83 jobs in supplier businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that textiles accounts for half the manufacturing jobs in the Scottish borders. However, the industry is also important in other parts of Scotland. More than 16 per cent. of manufacturing jobs in Ayrshire, 14 per cent. in Tayside, 13 per cent. in the Forth valley, 12 per cent. in Lanarkshire, 9 per cent. in the highlands and islands, and 4 per cent. in Moray, Badenoch and Strathspey rely on textiles. The Scottish textiles and clothing industry is also a major exporter. In 1998, it exported goods to the value of £498 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully recognise the difficulties that the industry has experienced in recent years. Like other developed economies, the Scottish economy is losing volume garment manufacture to lower-wage economies. That is why we keep saying that we cannot begin to compete on labour costs alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also know that recent problems have been caused by major retailers sourcing more products overseas. We cannot force Marks and Spencer or any other retail company to buy British. That is a matter of of their commercial judgment.. The best way of encouraging them to do so is through the exercise of consumer preference. I do not single out Marks and Spencer, since, despite recent cutbacks, it sources a higher proportion of goods in the UK than any comparable chain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are already funding work to find ways of improving the domestic textile and clothing supply chain and so increase domestic sourcing. We shall continue to talk to manufacturers and major retailers to identify ways in which UK sourcing can be made more attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
There is real danger in talking down the industry. There are plenty of examples in Scotland of companies with superb, quality products, and I know that the industry gets very frustrated about being written off when there are so many good stories to tell. Traditional Weatherwear in Cumbernauld is producing traditional mackintoshes for the world's top design houses—and the company has a marvellously impressive apprenticeship programme. In the past couple of months, I have visited Hawick Cashmere, Johnstons of Elgin, Clan Douglas, Lochcarron, and Kenneth Mackenzie in Stornoway—each of those companies has an excellent story to tell. Tremendous work is also being done by the Galashiels campus of Heriot Watt university for the whole of the United Kingdom textile industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The announcement of Heriot Watt as a centre of manufacturing excellence in textiles and the award of funding through the Faraday Partnership is public proof that that is recognised by the industry and by the Department of Trade and Industry. Of course, all the measures for the UK textile industry will equally apply in Scotland. The Scotland Office will work closely with the Scottish Executive and the DTI to ensure that the measures are fully implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife (Mr. McLeish) considers that the importance of the textile industry to the Scottish economy merits further action by the Scottish Executive. That is why, earlier today at the first meeting of the Scottish Textile Forum, he announced a further comprehensive package of additional measures to support the textile industry in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The forum will represent the interests of the Scottish textile industry, and the Scotland Office will continue to work closely with the DTI and the Scottish Executive, the industry and trade unions to ensure that the views of the industry are fully known whenever necessary on issues such as the multifibre arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will continue to work closely with the commercial posts in overseas embassies and consulates, to promote the marketing of Scottish goods. Here at home, we plan to use Dover house, in the heart of Whitehall, to promote Scottish excellence. Dover house is a magnificent venue and an underused resource which we want to put to work in support of Scottish industry and Scottish jobs. We will show the way in September when two major, and, I predict, spectacular, promotional shows will be held—the first by the Harris Tweed Authority and the second by Scottish Cashmere. These will not be isolated events but will fit in closely with the international trade promotion efforts of those sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be remiss of me to make a statement on the textile industry without commenting on the renewed threat to the cashmere and other industries from retaliatory action over the dispute between the European Union and the United States of America on bananas. Not least because of the contacts developed during the previous "banana wars" episode, I have a close working relationship with the cashmere industry. Last year, the Government took prompt and decisive action to safeguard the industry when the same threat
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
arose. I am appalled that even the possibility of renewed innocent involvement in the same dispute should now have arisen. Hon. Members may rest assured that we will continue to lobby at every level on behalf of cashmere, and all other products, to remove United Kingdom items from the retaliation list. However, it is crucial to understand that no decision has yet been taken by the USA on the retaliation shortlist, far less to add cashmere knitwear to it. The consultation period ends on Wednesday, and the final list will be produced on 19 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, two messages must be hammered home: the first, to the United States authorities, is that the United Kingdom is part of the solution in Brussels and is fully committed to the introduction of a World Trade Organisation-compliant banana-importing regime based on the agreement that has been reached between the United States and the Caribbean producers. That position is unambiguous and unequivocal, and on that basis, there is no logical reason why retaliatory action against the United Kingdom should be escalated or even retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second message must be to the European Union. It is, quite simply, that the introduction of a WTO-compliant banana-importing regime is not a matter for further delay. It is an urgent necessity if the process of retaliation is to be brought to an end. Fifteen months have elapsed since the WTO panel once again found against the European Union on the issue. To any objective observer it is incomprehensible that these 15 months have not been sufficient to bring the matter to a WTO-compliant conclusion. Throughout that period, there have continued to be innocent victims in the UK and other EU member states. Now that list of victims threatens to change, or even lengthen. That is intolerable and all those who are responsible for negotiations in Brussels must recognise that it is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the textile industry, throughout the UK and in Scotland, needs our support both within the domestic market and in the complexities of international trade policy. With my own proposals, the packages announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry last week and by my hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife earlier today, offer a series of practical measures to help the industry, from the earliest design stages to finding new overseas markets. Together they offer a coherent plan for the future of the industry and of those people linked to it. We will work together to take the industry forward while supporting those affected by the changes that will inevitably take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the Minister's comments that textiles are important to the whole of Scotland. It was important that the enterprise Minister in the Scottish Executive held the textile forum this morning; I know from talking to representatives of some companies in my constituency who found it most useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The Minister of State is adding a Scottish context to his announcement last week; will he confirm that the resources that will come with that statement will be used primarily for the promotion of the industry for investment and training. Will the Minister explain what the balance will be? How much will come from the resources announced by the Secretary of State last week and how much from the Scottish Executive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister raised a matter that is important not only to my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), but to the whole of Scotland: the renewed threat to cashmere from the banana wars. I echo the Minister's comments on Europe's need to sort it out and the plea to the Americans to recognise Britain as part of the solution, not part of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his statement, the Minister talked about the Government's prompt and decisive action to assist the industry last year. Will he confirm that if his best endeavours and those of his ministerial colleagues, of my constituents and of those across the borders fail, and, by bad fortune, cashmere is back on the retaliation list, the Government will immediately introduce a bond scheme to protect the industry against the increased tariffs? It was introduced last year because the American action was deemed illegal and it was in place until the matter of legality was sorted out. The carousel provisions of the new United States trade law have not been tested at the World Trade Organisation. Can the Minister confirm that until that is done, the Government will support the Scottish cashmere industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman's definition of the priorities for the use of the money. It is not a case of giving handouts to the industry; it must be a way of securing the future. As the hon. Gentleman said, there is a trinity of promotion, investment and training, but promotion is the greatest of these. We have high-quality products, but we sometimes fall at the hurdle of getting them into world markets. The use of the money will largely be demand led, according to the criteria that it must sustain a future for the industries and that it is not simply bailing out industries that do not have long-term prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of last week's announcement is £14 million to £15 million and Scotland is part of that package. I do not know exactly how much the Scottish Executive intend to add to it and it will largely be in response to demand; for example, regional selective assistance is not something that can be quantified. I do not know how much will go to the textile industry, but the Scottish Executive would be pleased, as would I, if demands were made on the RSA as a result of companies deciding to invest and expand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, who keeps in close touch with me on these matters, knows the difficulties involved in the bond scheme. There is not an exact parallel. As he rightly said, the scheme could be introduced last year without it setting a precedent for other industries and other disputes when the potential for retaliation ran into hundreds of millions of pounds, because the period of orders, which was crucial to the cashmere industry, coincided—coincidentally—almost exactly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
with the period prior to the WTO giving its legitimacy to the Americans' action. That worked out fine and the scheme did not have to be called upon because cashmere dropped off the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Gentleman, I am interested in whether there are parallels in terms of the legitimacy and legality of the carousel action by the Americans; clearly, the circumstances are different and we must consider that. However, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the problem of putting in place contingencies and talking up the difficulties of cashmere is to run the risk of telling the Americans that it is the primary pressure point. All my efforts are going into keeping cashmere and taking the United Kingdom off the list. We should cross other bridges when we come to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his statement, but there is a problem in Midlothian. Laidlaw and Fairgreave is a wool-spinning organisation and a mill, which is under notice to close down within a month. Ballantynes, which made Scottish cashmere and is part of the Dawson group, is also closing. At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning I am going to meet Dawson at the headquarters in Kinross. What can I tell them? Is there any hope for Laidlaw and Fairgreaves at the eleventh hour? Can I give them a guarantee that either the hon. Gentleman or the Minister in another place will meet them to thrash out some of the proposals for constructive endorsement—to alleviate the plight of 290 men and women?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer to the latter part of my hon. Friend's question is yes, if I were asked to do so, I would be delighted to meet them, just as I would to meet the management and trade unions—or other representatives of the work force—of any company in difficulty. I strongly believe that Ministers should turn up where there is bad news, as well as for good. If Dawson can see a way ahead through discussions, I would be happy to take part in them. Whether there is a way ahead, I do not know. The fact that we have not received a request from Dawson's to meet them could be significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish knitwear and textiles industry faces problems as a result of competition from low-cost economies and it is having to concentrate more on niches, albeit successful niches, of high value. I was in the borders the other day when the announcement was made. It underlined the importance of cashmere, which is a growth sector within the industry, and, indeed, within the Dawson group. Other branches of lowlands textiles are suffering difficulties. I sympathise with my hon. Friend and if I receive a request for a meeting, I will accede positively to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome help for the borders and the centre of excellence at Heriot-Watt university, which I hope will be highly successful.

	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Minister intend to take to combat the effects of the strong pound, which remains a constant threat to the industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The strong pound has to be viewed in perspective. Everyone knows that exporters face additional difficulties not so much because of the strong pound, but because of the weak euro. Exporters recognise that distinction. The industry as a whole does not export exclusively to Europe: it does well in the far east, north America and other world markets. It is more difficult to sell in Europe because of the weakness of the euro against the pound, so companies have moved their exporting efforts elsewhere. However, exporters are doing well in Europe with high-value products, which are less vulnerable than lower-value products to currency transactions. The message that comes through constantly is that there is a wonderful future for this industry at the top end of the market. The industry is in transition.

The hon. Gentleman asked how much of the £15 million will apply to Scotland. The funding is not on a pro rata basis, but is largely demand led. I would be happy to clarify the matter in greater detail by writing to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What do representatives of the industry say about the strong pound?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not for the first time in his long career, my hon. Friend will know the answer to his own question. Some agree and some disagree. I would not expect unanimity in that sector any more than in any other. The polarisation comes more from politicians and the media than from industry, which can see both sides of the coin. Companies know that everything does not hang on the euro. They know that they must adapt to become more competitive and they can see long-term advantages in the fact that they are forced to become so. They also realise that they must diversify into other markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of no representatives of the industry in Scotland who say that they are completely finished because of the weak euro and that they cannot go elsewhere. They adapt to new circumstances and gain the prospect of long-term benefits. They recognise that their problems are mainly the result of the weak euro rather than the pound, so they are not all the Government's responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He will be aware of the current difficulties of Hunters of Brora, which is in the hands of a receiver. Its future is crucially important for the fragile area of east Sutherland.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For many years, the right hon. Gentleman has supported the interests of Hunters of Brora and has pointed out its significant contribution to the economy of east Sutherland. I would love something to be done to sustain the company because I, too, am aware of its importance to that region and—as buyers of wool as well as manufacturers of tweeds—to the entire highlands economy. I have offered to visit Hunters of Brora whenever it would be helpful, but that might not be until it is clear which competitors are likely to take it over. I shall be visiting the right hon. Gentleman's constituency early in July. If appropriate, I would be pleased to visit Hunters of Brora.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine that the financial support and other mechanisms that I described today would not be available through Highlands and Islands Enterprise if the circumstances justified it. The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Government made a substantial contribution to investment in Hunters of Brora. I was involved in that decision. The positive outcome is that investment has been made, so a company taking over Hunters of Brora will take over a first-class mill with a first-class work force and a first-class product.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes)—I welcome the statement and the report of the textile group, the launch of the national strategy and Scottish forum and especially the commitment to funding the strategy with real money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the risk of falling into the trap that my hon. Friend the Minister suggested and talking down the industry, we have to recognise that that strategy has come too late for a significant number of workers in my constituency who were recently made redundant by Jaeger and others whose jobs are under pressure. Since those developments and other pressures on the industry were part of the discussions that took place this morning between my colleague Margaret Jamieson MSP, leader of East Ayrshire council, and the Scottish Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning—my hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife—I will leave that aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A national strategy is important, but it is also important to recognise that, although industry throughout Scotland shares challenges and difficulties, a diversity of production generates different problems for different areas. The problems and challenges in Ayrshire are different from those faced by the borders. On behalf of workers in Ayrshire, will that be
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
recognised in the national strategy and the forum? Will discussion and planning be devolved to local forums to reflect local differences?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly think that it should be. My hon. Friend is right. One of the difficulties of a statement such as this is that it refers to "an industry", but that generic terms covers 100 different industries, all sectors of the market and all fabrics and products, and it is difficult to generalise. In Ayrshire, there is already a good deal of working together. There is a textiles forum in the Darvel valley and I hope that it will be supported.

We need to improve our act further in promoting what is manufactured. Undoubtedly, that would be best done on a coherent basis, whether in Scotland or in the United Kingdom as a whole. It must be done not by people cutting across one another, but by making the maximum use of our commercial posts overseas and with the support of British Trade International and Scottish Trade International. Working together and channelling local efforts through national support mechanisms is the theme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister kindly mentioned Traditional Weatherwear in Cumbernauld, which does a marvellous job. I welcome the setting up of the various bodies and the money is of great importance; but there are other difficulties. The clothing industry that supplies protective clothing to the Ministry of Defence throughout Britain is in some difficulty. Hopefully, the strategy will allow it to diversify. It is crucial for the United Kingdom to retain the ability to respond to emergencies and crises. For example, one company in my constituency worked night and day for six weeks to supply the Ministry of Defence during the Gulf war. Where would that expertise be found in future? Will the Minister tell us what the Government are doing to help that part of the textile industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in my statement, I visited Traditional Weatherwear recently. I have met some of its representatives on a number of occasions overseas. I recommend that my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) organises a bus ride to Cumbernauld for anyone who thinks that the story of Scottish textiles and garments is doom and gloom. It is a superb success story and a metaphor for many things. I presented certificates to 18 apprentices, all of whom had stayed the course. They had been taken on from school and acquired the specialised and unusual skills of hand-making coats that are now sold through Gucci, Versace and all the top designers in the world. They are made in Cumbernauld by my hon. Friend's highly skilled constituents.

The company has enjoyed recent investment from outside and, we should not be shy about that. Such investment is not always a take-over or a hostile act. Often it is necessary to allow the company to go

forward to the next stage of its development. As far as procurement policy is concerned, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. The problem is always having all our eggs in one basket. One cannot complain about our companies having to compete for UK orders when they often benefit from competing elsewhere in Europe for orders from other countries. We have to get the balance right. The strategy will mean improved lines of communication between companies and the procurement agencies so that this sort of upset is less likely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now move on to the main debate on the consequences of the Scotland Act 1998 relating to the size of the Scottish Parliament. I have no power to impose a time limit on speeches, but several hon. Members wish to take part in the debate and I appeal to all hon. Members to make their contributions brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems slightly odd that one consequence of the devolution settlement is that this subject, which is crucial to the future development of the Scottish Parliament, has to be discussed at Westminster, rather than in the Scottish Parliament, which is where it should be discussed and decided. One of the few powers remaining to the Secretary of State concerns the size of the Scottish Parliament. That power was given to Westminster by the Scotland Act 1998, despite the fine efforts of Scottish National party Members of Parliament, the acting First Minister, the hon. and Learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), his colleagues and some Back-Bench Labour Members with foresight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could fill my speech with a series of concise and effective arguments produced by the hon. Members for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), for Greenock and Inverclyde (Dr. Godman) and for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) and, above all, by the acting First Minister, to make the case for retaining the Scottish Parliament with 129 MSPs. Today, the arguments from both sides have moved on and Government Front-Bench spokesmen are, I hope, unlikely to use the same arguments as they did in 1998 when the Government first imposed the measure. I will refer only in passing to those earlier debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one commitment from that debate is central to our discussion. It was given during the final debate on the House of Lords amendment. The then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (Mr. Dewar) in a conciliatory moment conceded that, having seen how the Scottish Parliament was working, in the future, the Government might reconsider their view on the proposed reduction in the number of MSPs. His own words were more grudging.
	<br><blockquote><p>No doubt there will be possibilities to revisit the arguments if we are convinced by experience that 129 MSPs are essential and that any reduction in numbers would be a democratic disaster. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
shall have the opportunity to see how the Scottish Parliament works in practice before any changes are made to it.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 November 1998; vol.319, c.385.]</p></blockquote>
I note that the Secretary of State defaulted on that concession in his interview on Radio Scotland this morning and I welcome his recognition of that. The current Tory line is one of outright opposition. Of course, there are no Tories in the Committee today—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hear my colleagues demurring, so may be there are one or two Tories here after all on the Government Benches. The current chairman of Scottish Conservatives is taking an opportunist line to this debate, in stark comparison to his own colleague, Lord Mackay, who moved a private Member's Bill in the House of Lords in the 1998–99 Session to try to achieve what we are talking about today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding some of the protests I have heard in the past few days, it is appropriate that we should be having the debate now, only a few days short of the first anniversary of the transfer of powers to the Scottish Parliament. Reviews of the first year are being undertaken in some quarters of the Scottish Parliament, not least of which is a look at the committee system given the experience of the work load, which until July last year was only hypothetical. The hon. Member for Dundee, East, one of my colleagues in the Scottish Parliament's Convenors Liaison Group, might want to speak about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any significant cut in the number of MSPs on the scale envisaged in the Scotland Act 1998 will be an unmitigated disaster for the Committee system of the Scottish Parliament. The Committees have clearly emerged as the democratic backbone of the Parliament, and it is essential to review the proposed cuts sooner rather than later. I should declare an interest as convenor of one of the busiest and hardest-working Committees: the Justice and Home Affairs Committee. The experience of all the members of my Committee—Labour, Scottish Conservative, Liberal Democrat and SNP—is that the multi-pronged responsibilities of the Committee, such as dealing with legislation, scrutiny of the partner Department, handling many public petitions and the more general Select Committee function have meant a substantial work load.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Browne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friends are listening with care and will be receptive to any arguments that the hon. Lady advances. Does she accept that they would be more receptive to arguments about the use of MSPs' time, if MSPs used their time exclusively for the competencies of the Scottish Parliament and did not spend so much time discussing matters that are not devolved, but preserved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer the hon. Gentleman's comments to his colleague, Cathy Jamieson, who is active in the Scottish Parliament on the issue of asylum and immigration. I am sure that she will be pleased to know his views about her activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In preparing for the debate, I considered the relative work loads of all the Committees and noted with satisfaction, but certainly not surprise, that the Justice
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Committee has sat most often and has frequently been in the front line in dealing with some of the most complex and substantial pieces of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with all Committees, a large number of petitions have been referred to us, which the Scottish Parliament deals with very differently from this place. Again, the hon. Member for Dundee, East, who is the convenor of the Public Petitions Committee in the Scottish Parliament, might want to say a little about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Justice Committee took extensive evidence on one of those petitions and produced a report that is being considered by the Scottish Executive. That report is on the Carbeth Hutters. The Committee hopes that it will form the basis for a debate in Parliament later this year. Hon. Members might want to compare that with what happens to petitions at Westminster. That is one small example of the comparative work loads, which are difficult for hon. Members at Westminster even to begin to comprehend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1998, the Government produced two main arguments in support of reducing the size of the Scottish Parliament. First, they claimed that, for the sake of the Union and to avoid voter confusion, it was vital to ensure that the boundaries for Westminster and Holyrood constituencies were coterminous. Throughout the debate, they claimed that the system would fall down through confusion if voters were in different constituencies for each Parliament and that that was the driving motivation for cutting the number of MSPs in line with the proposed reduction at Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various hon. Members pointed to the existing differing boundaries at local and European level, with some council areas and euro-constituencies split between a number of MPs, but the Government held to their view that there was a substantial difference between the devolution settlement and any local government or European arrangements. However, recent events in London have blown that argument out of the water. The creation of a London Assembly means that MPs and Assembly members work together in much the same way as MPs and MSPs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted with interest that the principle of coterminous boundaries, which was so vital to Scotland, has not been applied in totality in London. Indeed, the parliamentary constituency in which we now sit is split between two London Assembly seats. Geese and ganders come to mind, until we remember that the principle was not held to even in Scotland, because Orkney was split from Shetland to make two Scottish parliamentary seats where only one Westminster seat exists. If it is possible for the voters of Orkney and Shetland to have two MSPs and for the voters of this London seat to handle two Assembly representatives, why on earth should it be beyond most Scottish voters to cope with the same system overall? That first and probably strongest card—which is not saying much—played by Ministers in 1998 has been undermined by both those sets of arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Ministers also claimed originally that the Scottish Parliament would be able to operate as effectively with 100 MSPs as with 129. We must now challenge that contention. Most hon. Members will be aware of the central role that Committees play in the Scottish Parliament. They basically combine the role of the Select and Standing Committees of this House, with a much stronger pre-legislative function that includes the ability to carry out an investigation that can call on outside opinion and expertise at every stage of a Bill's passage. They also have the power to initiate their own legislation. The Scottish parliamentary equivalent of this House's Committee stage involves a major element of investigation, on top of the scrutinising and amending functions that the Standing Committees also have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of equal importance to the legislative role is the requirement to monitor, scrutinise and report on the Executive's activities and to investigate issues of current concern. Our Committees are multi-functional and have been the success story of the Parliament's first year. I would fight anything that damaged the effectiveness of those Committees. The proposed reduction in the number of MSPs would do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that the Committee structure was being reviewed. Surely if the number of Committees is reduced, the same number of MSPs will no longer be needed to serve on those Committees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly not prejudge the outcome of the review. I would be surprised if it were felt that reducing the number of Committees would solve the problem with the work load.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may have some difficulty appreciating the full extent of the Committees' activities, so some statistics may highlight the substantial work load and the all-embracing demands. I analysed the work loads and legislative responsibilities of 16 Committees this year and compared the figures with those for the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, the Scottish Grand Committee and the two Scottish Standing Committees in the 1995–1996, 1996–1997 and 1999–2000 Sessions. My purpose is to show that the existence of the Scottish Parliament has created a higher level of demand for, expectation of, and, indeed, delivery in legislation and scrutiny and that the Committees are working flat out, and in some cases even beyond that, to meet their legitimate responsibilities. Any action that prevents them from doing the same amount of work in the future will damage the democratic process in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have established a level of performance that we feel is necessary to meet the expectations of the people and the demands of the legislative timetable, which was imposed by the Scottish Executive, most of whose members belong to the same party as Government Members here. Hon. Members would be foolish to believe that the work load will reduce. If anything, the demands will become greater. The Parliament's ability to cope with such demands will be significantly reduced if the number of MSPs is cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
The 16 Committees that I examined met more than 400 times in a parliamentary year of 40 weeks. That time includes the set-up period before the transfer of powers. The Committees have so far produced more than 130 reports and examined 18 pieces of legislation. That makes an average of 25 meetings and 8 reports per Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had known that I needed to prepare, I would have brought my diary to check all the work that I had done. However, I am more interested in finding out how the hon. Lady thinks that section 86 and the schedule will affect the long-term number of MSPs and the working of the Parliament. Does she agree with the views of Professor John Curtice in his article in the 	<i>Scottish Affairs</i> of spring 1998, entitled "Reinventing the yo-yo? A comment on the electoral provisions of the Scotland Bill". She wants to debate the issues, so can we get down to that, instead of hearing about her diary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had known that the hon. Gentleman would refer to detailed research, I would have brought all those research papers with me. I will quote only what his colleague in the House of Lords said as recently as 22 March 1999. Responding to Lord Mackay's Bill, Lord Sewel said:
	<br><blockquote><p>The Bill is clearly about the size of the parliament. Quite simply, the noble Lord's overall aim and the principle behind the Bill is…to break the link between Westminster and Scottish parliamentary constituencies and so fix the size of the Scottish Parliament…. The Government cannot, and do not, support such an aim.—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 22 March 1999; Vol. 598, c. 1087.]</p></blockquote>
That is all that requires to be said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been up and down like a jack-in-the-box. I suggest that he sits, in case he gives himself a hernia. In 1995–96 Scottish business in the House amounted to five Bills, dealt with in 10 days by the Standing Committee. The Select Committee met a further 25 times and produced three reports. In 1996–97 the pattern was the same: 10 Bills dealt with in 19 sittings, and two reports from the Select Committee, which met on 13 occasions. The difference is overwhelming, not only in total activity but also in the average performance of each Committee. Not only has the Parliament more to do, each Committee individually has a greater work load than the equivalent at Westminster, even in a relatively busy year such as 1996–97. Members of the Scottish Parliament sit on more than one Committee: the vast majority sit on two or more. Only Ministers, my national convenor and group leader and the leader of the Tory party are not involved in Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committees meet twice a week in some cases—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) comments from a sedentary position; I assure him that if the national convenor thought that his word was my command, his life would have been considerably easier in the past two decades. Committees meet twice a week across the country and most Members have responsibility for two or more. In terms of sheer work load Members of
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
the Scottish Parliament cannot deliver in the same way if their numbers are cut as drastically as the Government propose. That is a cross-party view in the Scottish Parliament and if Labour Members have a problem with that, I suggest that they take it up with their hon. Friends in their own Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is about work load, but equally about practicalities. If the size of the Parliament is cut, MSPs will have the choice of reducing the number of members of each Committee or of cutting the number of Committees. Leaving aside the matter of effectiveness, neither option will be easy. We have eight statutory Committees in the Parliament, which it would require primary legislation in Westminster to remove. The remainder are the subject Committees which, if lost, would mean Executive Departments not having a shadow Committee, or two Departments being shadowed by one Committee. Which should be removed: justice, health, education, social inclusion or local government? Arguably, there would be difficulties in removing any of them and I hope that Labour Members will accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other alternative would be to cut the number of MSPs on each Committee from the current average of 11 to nine, for example. However, Standing Orders require Committees to reflect the political balance of the Chamber; that is possible with Committees of 11, when the split is an easy four Labour, three Scottish National party, two Tory and two Liberal Democrats, but impossible in a Committee of nine. Those are the practical problems that will face the Parliament if the reduction in the number of MSPs goes ahead. The very nature of the Committees, their balance, their number and, above all, their effectiveness, will be threatened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not only my view. I can call to my assistance the words of the current acting First Minister, who said in 1998:
	<br><blockquote><p>We wish to retain larger numbers of MSPs because all parties agree … that the Scottish Parliament should work very much on a committee basis and that committees will have an important role to play. Those committees must have sufficient numbers to make them worth while.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 November 1998; Vol. 319, c. 390.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said at the outset, the reason for raising the matter is that we are one year on from the transfer of powers and thus have one year's experience. Reviews are already taking place in the Scottish Parliament to deal with the situation that has arisen. It is entirely appropriate to have a debate in this Parliament, which, after all, will ultimately take a decision on the matter. If this debate had been held in the Scottish Parliament, Labour Members would have been jumping up and down in horror because we were discussing a reserved matter. They cannot have it both ways.

This may be a controversial suggestion, but the Secretary of State should come up to the Scottish Parliament for a few days and attend a range of our Committees to see how we work. He may then come to share more closely my view of the issue and that of the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland. There has already been some movement by the Government in the past few days; their tone in response to the debate has changed remarkably since last week.

It would, however, be churlish not to welcome the Scottish National party to the debate and not to recognise that the Scottish Grand Committee is unable to face issues that are of great importance to Scotland but are reserved to Westminster—a fact that we have spent the past year denying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two other issues emerge from the hon. Lady's speech. The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) asked her why the matter was urgent. The tragedy is that it is urgent because SNP Members have decided that there will be a general election and that they had better turn
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
up at Westminster. What used to be the burning West Lothian question is now the Westminster question: why send the SNP to Westminster at all? It is a pity that an issue of such importance should be dealt with in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I want to correct the hon. Lady. She referred to what "the Secretary of State" - in other words, me - said last week and how it differed from what he said earlier. She made much of the change in a press release that she issued, which helpfully told us what she would say today. I had not spoken on this matter before last week. She may wish to amend the misleading impression that she inadvertently gave that there was a change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I nevertheless welcome the SNP here today, especially the big guns, although I realise that they are here because they are under friendly fire at home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Secretary of State moves on, may I ask him about turning up at Scottish Grand Committees? I have some research that states that the Secretary of State has attended only four Scottish Grand Committees out of 16 since the general election and I have attended 13. Why has he attended so few Committees that he believes in, when I have attended so many?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can explain that. Clearly, while I have been Secretary of State for Scotland and trying to assist in the governance of that country, I have attended every Scottish Grand Committee. The hon. Gentleman may not have noticed it, but prior to that I was also helping to run the country as Minister for Transport and Minister for the Armed Forces. In view of the hon. Gentleman's persistent questions about the role of the Secretary of State, can he give me one decision that he has made in 13 years that has affected the lives of the people of Scotland? Can he show me £1 that he has helped to allocate to Scottish people? Can he point to one law over which he has presided that has shaped Scotland's past? The answer to all three is that he cannot. He has the luxury of being here and the privilege of being a Member of this House. Unfortunately, for the past 12 months, he has hardly</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This debate has gone on long enough. We are not here to debate that today and I should be grateful if hon. Members would return to the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Maxton. Out of courtesy, I was responding to the reasonable question that the hon. Gentleman asked me. I hope that he finds my answer satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to the bigger issues that should have been raised in the opening speech. Let us start from the inherited position, enshrined in the Scotland Act, which represents the devolution settlement agreed and accepted by this House, by the vast majority of Members of the Scottish Parliament and by 74 per cent. of the Scottish people. That settlement was an historic change, perhaps the greatest in the governance of Britain in 300 years. It represented a new covenant with the Scottish people and, in John Smith's famous phrase, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>settled will of the Scottish people.</p></blockquote>
It also symbolises modernisation of the partnership that is the United Kingdom, and if it is used wisely, it will bring enormous benefits and advantages to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth (Ms Cunningham) pointed in glowing and glorious terms to the great scrutiny that can now be carried out by the Scottish Parliament. That is precisely why the Government argued for an established Scottish Parliament when it was being was derided and mocked by the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Secretary of State leaves behind the settled will of the Scottish people, will he say whether there are any circumstances in which he would argue for increased power for the Scottish Parliament beyond the current settled will?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible to envisage circumstances in which one could argue for almost anything, including decreased powers. That depends on any number of factors, including the will of the Scottish people. It is the settled will of the Scottish people—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) mocks; I know that he does not agree with the Scottish people but the Scottish people want the Parliament to have fewer powers than the hon. Gentleman, who wants a separate Parliament. If one asks hypothetical questions, one gets hypothetical answers. What is not in question is the fact that the Scottish people want their own devolved Parliament, covering important issues within the United Kingdom, as was accepted, supported and established by the Labour party and, to be fair, our colleagues the Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman to let me make progress, as I have been diverted twice already in trying to respond to some fair questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only fair to the rest of the United Kingdom that following the gain of the devolved Parliament, Scottish Members of Parliament in Westminster will be elected on the same demographical and numerical basis as the rest of the United Kingdom. That was an integral part of the devolution agreement, which no one has challenged. The White Paper "Scotland's Parliament" was the basis on which the Scottish people voted in the referendum; it was the foundation stone on which we established the Scottish Parliament. The White Paper made it clear in paragraph 8.7:
	<br><blockquote><p>Any changes in Westminster constituencies will result in changes to Scottish Parliamentary constituencies; and may also lead to consequential adjustments to the size of the Scottish Parliament so as to maintain the present balance between constituency and additional Member seats.</p></blockquote>
It was agreed and accepted that that would consequently mean a reduction in the number of MSPs. That was not an unforeseen consequence; it was debated, voted upon, decided and agreed here, in the southern Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
That is the starting point; where are we now? We have made tremendous strides in the past 12 months, which is a matter of joy and pride to those of us who have long supported devolution. We fought for it and struggled to establish our devolved Parliament in Scotland. I say "our" devolved Parliament to the hon. Member for Perth because it was a gift that now belongs to all of us in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Lady reflected further on her opening remarks, which questioned the integrity of people here, she would realise that they were a trifle arrogant. All of us are elected representatives of the Scottish people, and I remind the hon. Lady that Labour Members outnumber by eight times those affiliated to her party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who fought for the Scottish Parliament managed in three short years to consult the Scottish people in a referendum, to act on their will, to establish the Parliament and to embark on a programme of political, social and economic change that will shape the future of our country. I believe that we have some reason for pride in our achievements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with all radical transformations, it has not been without challenges. The late and great miners' leader, Michael McGaghey once said that nothing is as painful as the birth of a new idea. It was indeed a new and radical idea. Those who were not only present at the birth, but who were, in some sense, the midwives, have a particular interest in caring for and nourishing the Scottish Parliament after its establishment. If it has had trials and tribulations as well as celebrations and congratulations since it was formed, that is to be expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our Scottish Parliament is still a young Parliament. When I consider the expectations placed on the Liberal-Labour coalition and the short period that it has had to meet them, I and other Labour Members—who have to grapple with the real problems of government rather than the easy rhetoric of opposition—realise the magnitude of the task that the coalition had to face. The two coalition parties, the Scottish Executive and the Government have met those challenges. Where necessary, we have changed and adapted—here at Westminster as well as at Holyrood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (Mr. Dewar), my hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife (Mr. McLeish) and the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), as well as to Scottish Ministers and others for their contributions. It is also fitting officially to wish a speedy recovery to the First Minister. I am sure that all those people would be generous enough to reciprocate by paying tribute to Members of Parliament at Westminster. We have jointly used our wit, wisdom and experience to overcome the challenges. We did so because the people of Scotland expected it of us—working together for their benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of working together, all parties on the European Committee of the Scottish Parliament invited the Secretary of State to give evidence on the crucial questions of additionality and funding, which touch on Westminster responsibilities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
and those of the Scottish Parliament. Why, in the spirit of working together, did the Secretary of State refuse to turn up and give evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did so because the people of Scotland have the right to elect their own Members of the Scottish Parliament to deal with Scottish issues. The hon. Gentleman may not have noticed, but the Scottish Parliament has a highly capable Finance Minister whom I meet regularly. The hon. Gentleman's problem is that he will not accept the settled will of the Scottish people; on every occasion, he attempts to set the Parliaments in confrontation. Whether we are talking about borders or boxing, he should know that not all of us are naïve enough to fall into the SNP trap of using the Holyrood Parliament as a battering ram against Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If circumstances were exceptional and the Scottish Finance Minister were incapable of answering even the most intricate of the hon. Gentleman's questions, a case could be made for acceding to his request. It is allowed under the memorandums. At this stage, however, there is no reason for that to occur. The hon. Gentleman should not forget that this House also has a Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, which invited me and my fellow Ministers to speak on the matter. I shall answer to that Committee, and Jack McConnell, the Scottish Minister for Finance, will answer to the Scottish Parliament. That is how it should be in the normal course of events.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help the Secretary of State on the problem of Committees.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we are working together, notwithstanding the confrontation agenda of the SNP. Whatever the subject, the SNP will attempt to misuse the Scottish Parliament, just as its members opposed its establishment for 20 years. We will not allow them to cause antagonism between the two Parliaments. The Scottish people know that establishing the partnership was no easy task. Some people pretended that no problems would need to be overcome and that it would be a disaster if issues had to be worked through: they
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
were either fools or political opportunists. To our credit, neither we nor our colleagues in the Liberal Democrat party have fallen into either of those categories. It is clear that others have managed to fall into both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall continue to adopt the same approach in future. Anyone with any sense knows that such a young Parliament will grow into its role. Its Members and leaders will learn from experience and from the reality and practice of government, just as we do in this House. My colleagues in the Scottish Executive and I are well aware that new challenges have to be met. As hon. Members would expect, we discuss issues frequently because we have an interest in the successful development of the Scottish Parliament. In common with the Scottish people, we want to see it flourish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, it seems that it is the SNP's turn to ask a question that has already been raised before. SNP Members want me to change the requirements of the Scotland Act in order to reduce the size of the Scottish Parliament. That is an interesting departure in itself—after denigrating the Secretary of State's role for the previous year, the SNP now demonstrates one of the reasons why the office is so useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a struggle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Better to have admitted being wrong than not doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of urgency, we have plenty of time to examine the issue rationally on the basis of evidence of the Parliament's operation. Let us remember that the Scottish Parliament has operated with its full powers for less than a year. To be pragmatic, rather than dogmatic, we would be wise to allow sufficient time to make a sensible evaluation. There is no compelling reason to rush. In all likelihood, the first practical date by which any change could take effect is 2007.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Boundary Commission for Scotland is likely to begin work on the next review of constituency boundaries next year. It is required to report between December 2002 and December 2006. Its report will take time to implement—electoral rolls must be prepared, for example—and there is no expectation that its review will have consequences for the Scottish Parliament elections in 2003. In other words, we are not up against the tight deadline implied by the hon. Member for Perth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the attendance of the SNP in this House is anything to go by, it may be the only opportunity that we have between now and 2007.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be diverted in that direction, but during the previous Scottish Questions, I did a quick calculation and found that the total number of votes cast by the SNP from 3 April was 46. That compares with 2,183 on this side of the House. That puts it into perspective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Daly ell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One question must be answered. What instructions are being given to the architect and the architectural firm involved about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
size and the amount of accommodation in the building, which, for understandable reasons, may take a long time to complete?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely interesting question. My hon. Friend will probably be gratified to know that I have not even dipped my toes into such details. I have no doubt that that factor will be have to be taken into account, along with the operation of the Parliament and consequential boundary changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Claims about uncertainty for the next elections to the Parliament are bogus, as are the SNP's claims that the Government have set their face against any change. The door is open, but the argument has to be made and weighed up, because change will affect the Parliament and have wider boundary implications for both MPs and MSPs. I am pleased to make it clear today that if a good case for changing the Scotland Act can be made at the appropriate time, the Government will consider it. The people of Scotland expect us to judge that case with an open mind and review the issue in the light of experience in our Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I believe that the SNP has put its own integrity on trial today. The SNP will undermine the case of those who wish the higher number of MSPs to be retained if it attempts to turn the Parliament into a talking shop that continually debates issues over which it has no power and no locus. The Scottish people will not be impressed by claims that the Parliament needs to debate reserved matters if the people who misuse the Parliament in that way are elected representatives in this House but do not bother to turn up here to discuss those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a flourishing Scottish Parliament, if experience shows that one party has consistently sought to raise matters that are not the Parliament's responsibility, the people of Scotland will reasonably ask why that same party demands that we should continue to pay for the present number of MSPs, whose time the SNP is misusing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that as if he had never thought of the idea before. I recognise that it poses something of a problem for him, but I shall put it simply. He must consider three questions. First, is he prepared to operate constructively within the devolution settlement and accept the will of the Scottish people, instead of using the Scottish Parliament as a battering ram against the United Kingdom Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not asked all three questions yet. Does the hon. Gentleman accept devolution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, is he prepared to put the interest of the Scottish Parliament and the instincts and will of the Scottish people above narrow party political advantage? Thirdly, will he support the case for maintaining the present number of MSPs in practice as well as in rhetoric, by ensuring that the Scottish Parliament concentrates largely on devolved matters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Whatever its intentions in raising the issue, the SNP has ensured by so doing that in future the spotlight of scrutiny will be placed on its members' conduct in the Scottish Parliament. In light of their behaviour, people can decide whether they are sincere in supporting the case for the retention of the MSPs and big enough to put the interests of our country and our Parliament above their party. For that reason alone, I am deeply grateful to the SNP for raising the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join hon. Members in wishing the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (Mr. Dewar) all the best in his recovery from an operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject before us is the consequences of provisions in the Scotland Act 1998 that relate to the size of the Scottish Parliament. Having sought advice from Dr. Michael Dyer of the university of Aberdeen, my understanding is that in 2007, if the Act has not been revised, there are likely to be 57 seats from the first-past-the-post elections to the Scottish Parliament and 48 seats from the list system. Clearly, that is a dramatic consequence for the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has already been said that Liberal Democrats, in the run-up to the Act, made a strong case for decoupling the size of the Scottish Parliament from the need to reduce the number of MPs coming to Westminster from Scotland, to recognise the new settlement of the Scottish Parliament and the changed nature and role of MPs. There was no longer any justification for an artificial floor to give us extra MPs in Scotland, because the UK Parliament should be a Parliament of equals, with the same tariff electing people from throughout the country, regardless of whether they were north or south of the border. Obviously, the boundary commission must still consider geography and the need for representation of constituencies of a sensible size in certain parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concerns, which have been rehearsed already, involved considering the structure and working of the Scottish Parliament, which faced a cut in the number of MSPs. The Committee structure was envisaged before the Parliament was set up and was trumpeted as the way in which we wanted the Parliament to work. It was obvious before the election that the Committee structure and, therefore, the number of MSPs available to serve on and chair Committees and form the Executive would be important. Mental arithmetic showed that if the number of MSPs were reduced too much, an awful lot of pressure would be placed on people to make the system work and make it deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of a party committed to electoral reform, Liberal Democrats were concerned about the reduction in proportionality that would result from reducing the list members to 48. Reducing the number of list members increases the threshold that a party must cross if it is to have someone elected under the proportional element of the system. That could affect the election chances of small parties, such as the Greens, and the proportionality of people elected from other parties. The great advantage of debating the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
matter before an election is that we can debate it in the abstract and on principle, although people can try to make forward projections. I suppose that there is a danger that people will make calculations about how individual parties will be affected. There is still an underlying principle: if we believe in a proportional electoral system, we do not want that proportionality to be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important point, which the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) made during the debate on the Scotland Bill, concerns the stability of the Parliament and the culture that is created when people are told, "Well, you've all been elected, and 20 or so of you are going to lose your jobs in the next few years. Choose among yourselves who's going to go and who's going to stay." That does not make for the most constructive and forward-looking working relationship in the Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point involves the structures and working arrangements in the Parliament, which the hon. Member for Linlithgow raised in this debate. A Parliament building is being constructed. Work and office structures are being set up and people are being employed. Clearly, decisions that will be affected by any amendment of the Scotland Act are being made in the Parliament. Therefore, it would be helpful to know where we are going. I welcome the Government's openness in recognising that there is room for debate and a need to look again at the Scotland Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with care to the arguments that the hon. Gentleman is making. Do I understand that his party is arguing that there should be less adoption of Westminster Members? If not, is he about to come to the argument over whether there is value in having coterminus constituencies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear that because of the transfer of powers in the Scotland Act, there was no longer a justification for an artificial floor under the number of Members of Parliament in Scotland, and that they should be elected on the same quotas as in England and with the same ratio of electorate to Members. Clearly, therefore, there should be a reduction in the number of Westminster Members elected in Scotland. However, there must also be stability in the Scottish Parliament, which implies decoupling the boundaries involving those elected to serve in the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our party made a judgment. Having non-coterminous boundaries for two elected representatives mattered less than undermining the democracy and proportionality of the Parliament and the effectiveness of its scrutiny and delivery of legislation. We felt it more important to make the size of Parliament right, rather than relate it to the size of another, which is a separate issue. If the Jenkins Commission were to be accepted and a referendum held, as the Government promised, the number of Members coming to Westminster would be reduced
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
even further. Under the Scotland Act 1998, that would again place a slippery slope beneath the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to recognise that decoupling is necessary. I shall come to that problem later. I urge the Secretary of State to read Dr. Michael Dyer's publication "Modernising Parliamentary Representation in the United Kingdom: A Modest Proposal for Addressing the Scottish Case" when it finally comes out. As it has not yet been published, it is still in draft form, but it comes from the university of Aberdeen—a very good university—and I vouchsafe its academic credentials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Dyer points out the interesting history of the boundaries and the sizes of the constituencies. In a strange way, Westminster boundaries try to avoid cutting across local government boundaries, and the local government boundaries on which we were elected in first-past-the-post elections are for authorities that no longer exist. For list members, we used constituencies that have never been used for the European Parliament. The boundaries come from historic decisions, and it is time to review how we arrive at all the different constituency structures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's whole argument is prefaced only on part of what the boundary commission sets out to do. First, it divides the country up in quotas, but then it sets out to reflect local government boundaries, such as they are, as well as topographical and geographical issues. All these matters can be addressed within the boundary commission rules. The fact that local boundaries are changed from one review to another does not mean there is anything wrong with the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be worth reviewing that process because the building blocks for parliamentary constituencies tend to be the boundaries of wards for local government elections. If the proposal for the single transferable vote goes through in the Scottish Parliament, that will increase dramatically the size of the wards and the potential building blocks available to the boundary commission, so that they may need to look again at how that is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is so much decoupling to do, it is important that the Government set out how they plan to respond flexibly. There is a need for some kind of timetable. The elections that will be affected are a long way off, but boundary commission reviews will start soon, and the need to review the boundaries for the Scottish Parliament will not disappear simply because we decide not to cut the numbers of Members in the Westminster Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take two constituencies at random, the electorate for Glasgow, Pollok is 49,284, while that for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine is 59,123. Even if retain the Scottish Parliament at its current size, we will need procedures for reviewing electoral boundaries. The matter is not urgent, but the long lead time for getting into the queue and the time that it takes to pass legislation through all its stages, means that proposals to amend the Scotland Act will have to be included in a Queen's Speech reasonably soon. The procedures for how, in that event, the boundaries are reviewed would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
also have to be set up. That would reduce the instability affecting those who are building the Parliament, working in it and trying to set up a committee structure. If we are moving towards recognising flexibility, we must firm up proposals for it. I urge that people in all parties try to do so, although it will be difficult, without calculating how they themselves might benefit by the exact number of seats available under different systems. We must reconsider the fundamental principles of maintaining the stability of the Parliament and its proportionality, and making its Committee structure effective. I hope to hear the Minister recognise that we need to build dialogue and debate throughout Scotland so that we may decouple the Scottish Parliament from the Westminster Parliament, and confirm that the latter will be reduced in line with the Scotland Act. There is a window of hope for the Scottish Parliament to firm up its future, to ensure sound foundations on which to build on what it has already achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That was, indeed, her only point. The nature of the debate is highly questionable given that there are at least six, if not seven, years to look at this issue. I am surprised that the SNP have not brought forward matters of substance to do with the reserved powers rather than an issue that will not affect us for years

The SNP intend today's debate to sow conflict and doubt. SNP Members put themselves forward as supposed defenders of the Scottish Parliament, but in the years when the Scottish Parliament was being formulated, my hon. Friends the Members for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) and for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) were in the Scottish constitutional convention when the question was: "Where is the SNP?" The SNP was nowhere to be seen then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The settlement was achieved solely through the commitment of the Labour Government, supported by 75 per cent. of the Scottish people. It is the most profound change in the constitution for 300 years. Of course, problems will be experienced and a bedding-in period is required. People must realise that and work together. Sadly, we have seen today from the SNP the same old politics of division and confrontation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to hear sound arguments from the SNP. It does not realise that we are creating a new politics of co-operation in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. The Secretary of State for Wales and the National Assembly's Health and Social Services Secretary attended the national health service summit in Downing street last Monday, along with the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein's Bairbre de Bruin. The SNP is behind the times in failing to realise that a new politics exists—a politics not of division, but of co-operation and partnership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dislike being called a Johnny-come-lately—I advocated devolution in the 1970s. The hon. Gentleman accuses the SNP of division and confrontation. Is he not aware that members of all parties in the Scottish Parliament are united in support of our position? They simply want a sensible solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody is complaining about that, but our memories are alive to the SNP's confrontational approach. We remember the Mike Tyson debate. Many people in Scotland had genuine concerns about the Mike Tyson issue, but the SNP wanted to use it as

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
a battering ram to divide the Westminster Parliament and the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Parliament, in its wisdom, ensured that the SNP did not get its way. Other MSPs realised that the wider agenda of the Westminster Parliament working with the Scottish Parliament had to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP acquiesced in the Scotland Act. In Committee on the Scotland Bill, the measure that we are discussing was debated on the first day. In reopening the Scotland Act, we would have to examine several issues. People might take advantage and start to question the electoral system, the committee system and the number of MSPs. I warn the Committee about taking such a serious step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want the number of MSPs to be reduced, but I gather that the SNP wants to reduce its number of MSPs. Today's Edinburgh paper says that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan will give Margo MacDonald—she is described as a fundamentalist—a final warning on Thursday. The SNP is divided between the gradualists, who still do not sign up to the Scottish Parliament, and the fundamentalists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That fight contrasts with how the Labour Government in Westminster are working alongside the Labour Administration in Scotland. I was delighted to hear the Secretary of State saying today that we are receptive to working jointly with our colleagues in the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament for the benefit of the Scottish people. The only people who have a problem with that are members of the SNP, whose sole aim is division. We want the new politics, the new Parliament and a new Scotland—and we are working with all parties to bring that about. The odd people out are the SNP, which explains the subject of today's debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), I am surprised at the choice of subject for today's debate. The SNP has one opportunity a year to decide on a topic for discussion. The decision on the size of the Scottish Parliament will not be taken finally until 2007, so I am not certain why there is an urgent necessity to debate the subject today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many other important issues, such as child poverty or the national minimum wage, could have been debated. Presumably, those subjects are unimportant to the SNP, which may be why SNP Members are unwilling to table a debate on the national minimum wage. They could have chosen a debate on shipbuilding on the Clyde. Many of us know that we debated that subject a week before last, but SNP Members are unlikely to know it because none of them bothered to turn up to the crucial debate proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sarwar). For once, could the SNP concentrate on issues that affect the people of Scotland, rather than try to sow constitutional conflict between the two Parliaments in which the Scottish people have invested their hopes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
I am also surprised that the SNP chose to debate the topic on this of all days. From the weekend's and today's press reports, it seems that the SNP has its own way of reducing its membership of the Scottish Parliament. According to the front page of this evening's Edinburgh 	<i>Evening News,</i> "Poor Margot MacDonald" has faced an "SNP Axe" and is to be punished for missing one vote in the Scottish Parliament. On that disciplinary basis, the entire parliamentary group of the SNP should be meted out the same punishment of exile that the leader of the SNP imposed on his treasurer, Mr. Blackford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What did the hon. Member for Perth (Ms Cunningham) say on behalf of the SNP as she kicked off today's debate? We heard that her great diary should be defended in all circumstances because the committee that she chairs is so busy. She is hoping to ignite the attention and affection of the Scottish public for her case, but there must be more convincing ways of doing so than trawling through the engagements in her diary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in Scotland work as hard, if not much harder, than the hon. Lady. Many of the tens of thousands of people ignored by the SNP in respect of the national minimum wage will listen with incredulity to the hon. Lady saying that the strongest argument for retaining 129 Members is that she is quite busy working in a Parliament that she and her colleagues recently said could not deliver a pizza. The hon. Lady and her colleagues argued that it was a Mickey Mouse Parliament and that the national flag of this country was a sign and symbol of oppression. Those arguments will neither catch the public attention nor ignite public affection for her case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard the same argument on several occasions. It cropped up over section 28 of the Scotland Act. Few people would strenuously oppose the change in the number of Westminster Members of Parliament. We have already heard from the Liberal Democrats that the number of constituents for many Westminster Members of Parliament in Scotland is much smaller than the average throughout the rest of the United Kingdom—approximately 70,000. My own seat has around 70,000 constituents, in comparison with the Scottish average of 55,000. The Scottish population is changing, which necessitates a change in political representation. The city of Glasgow has the lowest population since 1891. That and other facts will lead to changes in Scottish representation at Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to make a choice about electoral geography and the type of electoral system that we want to construct over the next few years. As the Liberal Democrats have said, we have one system of election for Members of the European Parliament and another—a regional list system—for Members of the Scottish Parliament. There are seven regions of eight Members in one case, and one region called Scotland, which has eight Members, in the other—and we may soon change our system of electing local councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that the Scottish people are not sensible enough to understand the world of politics; I am simply cautioning that, as we continue to change
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the hon. Gentleman issues his cautionary notes to the Committee, will he clarify his own views about electoral reform for local authorities? Does he support the partnership agreement that there should be some form of proportional representation for the election of local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would prefer it if the hon. Gentleman did not go down that route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a route down which I have travelled—not, as my hon. Friend for Dumbarton said, as a Johnny-come-lately, but as a Johnny-comes-to-Parliament occasionally. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coterminality between Westminster and Holyrood, rather than the busy diary of the hon. Member for Perth, is the key issue. Once a decision is made on that, much else will follow. If we want to break the link between similar constituencies, other matters for decision will arise. Breaking the link could lead to an imbalance between list and first-past-the-post MSPs. If we maintain the link between Westminster first-past-the-post Members and the Scottish Parliament first-past-the-post system, and if we reduce the number of first-past-the-post Scottish seats to 60, we will upset the balance. A majority could be elected on party lists through a system of proportional representation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In spite of attempts to play the subject down and produce red herrings about attendance records and other detours, the substance of the issue must be addressed. It is important because it touches on the ability of the Scottish Parliament to deal effectively with crucial issues such as health, education, housing and social justice in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Perth (Ms Cunningham) argued earlier, the ability of the Scottish Parliament's Committees to continue the excellent work that they started this year will be threatened by any proposed reduction in the number of MSPs. It is quite right for us to debate that issue. It is disingenuous of Labour Members to describe this as a constitutional debate. It touches directly on the ability of the Scottish Parliament to deal effectively with hospitals, schools, law courts and homes and all other devolved issues. It was dealt with in some detail during passage of the Scotland Act 1998, and it was then expected that the Government would concede on
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
the issue when the Bill reached the House of Lords. Indeed, on 12 May 1998, the then Minister, the hon. Member for Central Fife (Mr. McLeish), said
	<br><blockquote><p>If we establish a parliament of 129 members, there is an expectation that they might want to continue. … With those few remarks I hope that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland will withdraw his amendment and allow us to complete that consideration. [	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 May 1998; col. 223/4.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister's message was coded, but clear. Opposition Members from this party and from the Liberal Democrat party understood him to mean that the Government would see the light, and that the necessary amendment would be tabled in the Lords. However, the Scottish Office did not count on interference by the Prime Minister. They may have seen the logic of our arguments then, as Ministers seem to now, but in what 	<i>The Scotsman</i> described as
	<br><blockquote><p>Blair snub for Dewar on Holyrood seats,</p></blockquote>
No. 10 decided not to give way. The Government rejected maintaining the size of the Parliament in 1998—that was the reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is claimed that it is the fault of the Prime Minister that one decision was reached, will the hon. Gentleman pay credit to the Prime Minister for the decision taken since that accepts that the matter will be looked at again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Secretary of State saying that the decision came direct from No. 10? I should be interested to know that; the original decision obviously came from there. The Government rejected the idea not once, but twice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to hear the Secretary of State say that he is opening the door, but I am not sure what he means. I should like to see the door fully opened, and the decision delivered safe to shore. Will he or the Minister of State tell us that they will ensure that the full number of seats is retained? I have not heard them say that. I have referred to past events, when the proposal was twice rejected. The second time was in March 1999 when Lord MacKay raised the matter in a private Member's Bill in another place. At that time, Lord Sewel—which makes me wonder who does speak for the Government on this matter—said
	<br><blockquote><p>The Bill is clearly about the size of parliament. Quite simply, the noble Lord's overall aim and the principle behind the Bill is to break the link between Westminster and the Scottish parliamentary constituencies and so fix the size of the Scottish Parliament at 129 members at least. The Government cannot, and do not, support such an aim.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> Lords, 22 March 1999; col. 1081.]</p></blockquote>
If the position has changed, I shall be very happy to hear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that time is short, Mr. Maxton, and that you wish to allow others to speak. I am delighted that the Government's concession appears to have arisen neither from the Liberal amendment of 1998 nor the Tory Bill of 1999, but from an SNP debate in 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Perth spoke at some length about the work load of the Scottish Parliament. I reiterate what she said, because it is at the heart of the matter. As things stand, while 19 Scottish Labour Members serve on one or more Committee in the Westminster Parliament, 101 MSPs serve on one or more committee at Holyrood. Excluding Ministers,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
only three MSPs serve on no Scottish Parliament committee, compared with 26 Scottish Labour MPs who serve on no Committee here. The committees are crucial to the good working of the Scottish Parliament, and the Secretary of State has said that he, like me, wants that to be so. The figures speak for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a member of a Committee here, and I attend it regularly, which conflicts with the image suggested earlier. My attendance record on Committees can stand with that of any Member. To anyone who wishes to disagree with that, I simply echo what the Secretary of State said. He said that he used not to attend the Grand Committee because he was running another Department. If I am not here for Scottish Questions, it is because I am running my committees in the Scottish Parliament. If that reason was good enough for him, it is good enough for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State reputedly seeks discussion and agreement in the Scottish Parliament on this issue, but he already knows the answer. MSPs across the parties, including his own, will, I am sure, be united against any cut. The tone of the Government's statements has changed noticeably over the past few days. I welcome that, but the Secretary of State must know that the game's a-bogie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP realised way back in 1998 that the Government's position was untenable. Our belief was confirmed by a particularly colourful intervention from the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) in the dying days of debate on the Scotland Act. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>What happens if the Scottish Parliament says no? What happens if the Scottish Parliament says, "We do not want the size of the Parliament reduced—we want to retain 129 Members"? If Westminster consults and the Scottish Parliament says no, what does Westminster do then? Will it send the tanks up to surround Holyrood to demand that 20 Members get out, or else?—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 November 1998; Vol. 319, c. 392.]</p></blockquote>
Tempted though the Secretary of State might be, I do not think that it will ever come to that. It looks as though the Secretary of State and the rest of the Government have finally begun to see sense and, happily, the ministerial tanks will not roll up to Holyrood. The Minister is no friend of the Scottish Parliament, but at least he should know that he has lost the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposed change would require primary legislation. Open doors are one thing, but I hope to hear a timetable for that legislation, bearing in mind the fact that the boundary commission begins its deliberations in 2002. I hope to see a Bill before the next election, and am sure that the Secretary of State and his colleagues will be delighted to have a Bill before this House. After all, it will enable them to do some real work for their ministerial salaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

time this debate is. We could be discussing issues of great importance to the people of Scotland. Not only is valuable parliamentary time being wasted, we are also wasting valuable personal time in which we could be dealing with issues of great importance to our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are we actually doing? We are discussing the SNP's jobs. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy) clearly demonstrated that when he said that, under the new system, most people could be elected from party lists. That is the SNP's exact position in the Scottish Parliament, so the SNP has initiated this debate to talk about its own jobs. The debate is a job creation scheme for Alex, Margaret, John, Alasdair and Roseanna—the hon. Members of the SNP in this House. It represents a new deal for the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), not a new deal for the unemployed. This debate is all about jobs for the SNP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A report about child poverty was published at the weekend in Scotland, but we are discussing issues of total unimportance to people outside this House and anyone outside the SNP. The SNP do not want to debate or vote on pensions, welfare reform, employment, new deal or defence contracts—all matters of great importance to people outside this House. It makes me angry to think of the time that the SNP is wasting. The debate will continue until 7 pm. Hon. Members want to take part and we will do so. The nationalists have chosen to talk not about the number of jobs in Scotland, but about the number of jobs that they will have after 2007. We should also be aware that they are wasting time not only in Westminster, but in Glasgow and Edinburgh and wherever the Parliament meets. They are obsessed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I must say, however, that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan was certainly seen around the Yes-Yes campaign. I do not remember seeing too many of his colleagues, either in public or in private.—[	<b>Hon. Members:</b> "Withdraw."] Withdraw? I will not withdraw? It is about time the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving way. The SNP joined the Yes-Yes campaign and supported devolution, but it was the devolution that we delivered, and it was devolution—not independence. SNP Members stood for election and most of them were elected by the system of proportional representation, generously donated by the Labour Government. That allowed for the majority of Members to be elected by the list system. Having done that and been elected, what have the SNP done since? Nothing—except whinge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP is trying, as it has always done in the past, and as it does at every election—national, Scottish Parliament, or local government—to create a feeling of grievance. There is a grievance mentality among the SNP, and its members want to try to impart that to Scotland. Instead of helping the new Parliament to work—as we do—they constantly whinge and bleat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all that, we have heard the hon. Member for Perth (Ms Cunningham) make a speech about the success story of the Scottish Parliament during which she listed all its wonderful achievements. That is exactly why we set up the Scottish Parliament. That is exactly why the Labour Government said that we were providing a scheme that would deliver what the people of Scotland wanted. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, it was the settled will of the Scottish people. That is what we delivered. Anyone who was at that election, and anyone who was at the setting up of the Scottish Parliament, knows it was the settled will of the Scottish people. It has a great deal of support and yet the SNP, who walked away and who have been elected to the Parliament, did nothing in the constitutional convention to set it up, and does nothing now but whinge and carp. They do not assist in any way in allowing the Parliament to get on and do what it was set up to do. We are proud of the Scottish Parliament. We want it to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We at Westminster want the Parliament to work, and the SNP is not helping. It is foolish to waste time down here talking about a decision that need not be made for some years. The scenario might be completely different by then. The United Kingdom is in the middle of a huge constitutional change, including the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly, new London government and changes in the House of Lords. I expect that many regions of England will want to move towards devolved government too. As a result there will, of course, be reductions in Members at Westminster from all areas—that is inevitable—but we should see wait to see how it all works out. Everyone agrees that everything is up in the air. There is no need to decide now about the future size of the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

More and more, one has to ask why the SNP are here at Westminster if all they want to debate is their own jobs rather than the concerns of the people of Scotland.

As I said earlier to the Secretary of State, I have been to many Scottish Grand Committees. This is a curious one for a number of reasons. First, I usually agree in part with the Labour Back-Bench Members, but not at all with their Front Benchers. This time I sensed some agreement with the Front-Bench speech of the Secretary of State, but have heard very negative and grudging speeches from the Back Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood it, the Secretary of State said that there was an open door to our approach. In response to an intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Angus (Mr. Welsh), he seemed to imply that that statement had come straight from the Prime Minister. We are therefore entitled to say that what Lord Sewel said in 1998—to which the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) referred—was different from what he said six months later in 1999. The most recent definitive Government statement on the matter in either House of the Palace of Westminster seemed to take a much more negative line than the Secretary of State. I welcome that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To put it on the record, in 1998—which shows how far back this goes—Lord Sewel actually said:
	<br><blockquote><p>It would be open to the parliament, in the light of experience—an experience which, by definition, we cannot have now—to say to the Government of the day, "Look, we think we have got a system which works well and effectively. It is in danger of being disturbed in a very deleterious way if this reduction takes place."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Government are a listening Government and are prepared to enter into discussion and debate and to formulate policies on the basis of experience.—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 17 November 1998; Vol. 594, c. 1195.]</p></blockquote>
I used words today that paraphrase exactly what Lord Sewel said as far back as 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the quote from Lord Sewel on 17 November 1998 and I also have his quote from 22 March 1999. Any fair-minded person would say that if the door was opened in November 1998, it was rapidly closed again in March 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make some progress. What the Secretary of State said is more significant. He said that it is a summary of Lord Sewel's remarks. I thought that he would have claimed the credit, as he seemed to do for the Prime Minister, for saying that he is opening the door to the possibility outlined, now that the Scottish Parliament is in operation. There is a big consensus in the Scots Parliament that the Members are needed to staff the Committees, which are up and running and whose work load can be estimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With due respect to the hon. Members who disparaged my hon. Friends' remarks, it is important to hear about the work load from someone who chairs a Committee in the Scots Parliament. It would have been interesting to hear from the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), who also chairs a Committee, because we shall presumably make decisions based on that practical experience. I welcomed the Secretary of State's comments today, even if he went further than some of his Back Benchers seemed to want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome an apparent offer that the Secretary of State made to me. He said that if I could substantiate my argument that Jack McConnell was having some difficulty in giving evidence on certain matters to the Scottish Parliament's Committee, he might reconsider what I thought was his rather strange decision to turn down the European Committee's invitation on the question of European funding and additionality. In words that I have always wanted to use, I can say that I shall write to the right hon. Gentleman and attempt to support my argument. If I can do so, he will doubtless respond in kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also asked me what he described as three questions. They were rather long questions, although I would not exactly describe them as killer questions, and I shall attempt to answer them. He is labouring under a misapprehension. The SNP never agreed to abandon in any way our commitment to Scottish independence when we took part in the referendum campaign and voted on the Bill. Furthermore, that was explicit stated in 	<i>Hansard,</i> as the right hon. Gentleman should know from his predecessor. I draw his attention to the exchange between the current First Minister of Scotland and me in the House on 4 June 1997, when that point was made. It was precisely because the Secretary of State's predecessor, in what I consider to be a wise political act, said that it was of course open for the SNP to continue to campaign for our constitutional aim and that, if we got into a position to do so, it should be put to the people of Scotland in a single question referendum to have it endorsed. That was precisely the agreement by which we entered the referendum campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second question, I do not accept for a second that we have in any way misused our debating time in the Scots Parliament. I happen to have a list of the subjects that we have debated. We have had 14 supply or business days—non-executive time as the Scots Parliament describes them. We have debated the private finance initiative, which is an important issue, education, agricultural and rural affairs, and the plight
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
of Scotland's pensioners, which I accept is a reserved matter but is none the less important. The Act of Settlement which was an issue, although reserved, where the Scottish Parliament—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—I can save the Secretary of State the trouble. Nine out of the 14 debates we have held so far have been on devolved areas and five out of 14 have been on reserved areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act of Settlement debate, however, was an issue where the entire Parliament found itself able to unite and make a statement that in my view should have been made in Scotland many generations ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point. If he is going to spend between 40 and 50 per cent. of SNP time in that Parliament discussing issues over which the Parliament has no power and in which they have no locus, then he undermines the case being put by his colleague that the same number of MSPs is needed and the same time required to complete the business. I asked him whether he was prepared to support the case for the Scottish Parliament retaining the same number of MSPs by ditching the sectarian approach and discussing only devolved affairs in general in Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To talk about a sectarian approach when I have just talked about the Act of Settlement embracing the unity of the Parliament is very foolish. Perhaps the Secretary of State should tell Scottish pensioners that the Scottish Parliament should not be debating their plight now. That would be a very dusty answer indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Savidge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given way generously to the Secretary of State, as I am sure he will agree. I am rather puzzled that I have to say this. The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun made a substantive point when he referred to the Curtis report in terms of looking at the psephology of this. Regarding psephology, I should probably give some lessons to the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy) who, I think, managed to lose himself, never mind the rest of the Committee. The point in the Curtis report, which was published before the Parliament was established, is, as I understand it, that it would be foolish to reduce the size of the Parliament because it would then have to go back up again. That was the yo-yo effect to which Curtis was arguing. So Curtis, far from providing an argument against the proposal actually argues in favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important issue and I am sorry that I did not catch Mr Maxton's eye to get into this debate. The nub of the argument is that the hon. Gentleman expressed his view to the Committee on the operation of section 86 because it requires the boundary commission to use this quota on only one occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My view is that Curtis provides an argument for not cutting the size of the Scottish Parliament and for not setting the size of the Scottish Parliament on Westminster criteria. That is exactly the point that John Curtis was making. I was puzzled—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very restricted by time now. I was absolutely astonished by the suggestion that we came to this Committee to divide it with an argument that is certainly provoking unity in the Scots Parliament, and which, with a bit more grace, would provoke unity in this Parliament as well. Can I offer in evidence for my argument the fact that the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), never the strongest devolutionist in the history of Scottish aspirations is a maximalist on this point. It is probably the only area of the devolutionary Scots Parliament campaign where the hon. Gentleman was sympathetic to Scottish aspirations when he said that even he was not so ill-disposed as to wish to see any reduction in numbers of Members of the Edinburgh Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On an issue on which even the most stalwart opponent of Scottish self-government finds himself in with the consensus—this issue of the growth in the Scots Parliament—there remain some last-ditchers on the Labour Benches who continue to want division. We have established, if not to the satisfaction of some Labour Member at least to the satisfaction of the working majority in the Scots Parliament and the Scots people, that this argument has to be dealt with at some time soon. Our argument carries a consensus, and I hope that the open door that the Secretary of State offered the Committee is reflected in the winding-up speech from the Minister of State and in action to deal with what could become a democratic deficit in Scotland if the Secretary of State does not deliver on the hints that he gave this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to welcome the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). Metaphorically speaking, he has blood on his hands, following the night of the long skean-dhus. A member of the press asked me today, "Why does a single-issue pressure group need an international banker as treasurer anyway?" Like my hon. Friends, I note that the hon. Gentleman is now anxious to reduce the number of MSPs in his own group by at least one. However, I predict that by Thursday, he will have found a good reason for diplomatically withdrawing from the purge of Margo—fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, the debate has been extraordinary, but it will be important if its nuances and the identity of its instigators can be communicated to Scotland. I have two quotes to cite, one of which I randomly noted down today from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who has made similar points well in advance of the Committee's sitting and has never said anything else. He said that if a good case can be made, the Government will respond to it. End of story. What have we been talking about for all this time? Has it been worth the air fares? My right hon. Friend put the Government's position in a nutshell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As usual, like a Philadelphia lawyer, the SNP has tried to prove that my right hon. Friend contradicted previous statements. The name of Lord Sewel was invoked, and there was a barrack-room lawyer spasm
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
about whether the quote was from 1998 or 1999. Let me be clear. I am quoting from the same 	<i>Hansard</i> of 1999 as the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan used, in which Lord Sewel said:
	<br><blockquote><p>if, in the light of actual experience…the Scottish Parliament has a committee structure and a system of operating which requires a larger number of</p></blockquote>
members
	<br><blockquote><p>than would be allowed as a result of the changes following the reduction in the number of Scottish Members at Westminster, it would clearly be open to the Scottish Parliament to make representations.—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 22 March 1999; Vol. 598, c. 1089.]</p></blockquote>
If one puts those two quotes together, one has a non-issue, which is what the SNP has brought to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Either last week or the week before, a senior architect from the Scotland Office went to Barcelona to discuss obviously important matters with people in Mr. Miralles's office. The architects must have some guidance on what they are building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point could be argued in several contexts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that Lord Sewel said, and all that the Secretary of State and I are saying, is that there is no definitive position. The door is open. In the light of experience, a decision will be made. That is what matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the definitive position that which is in the Scotland Act? If the Government are not prepared to accept that they must take different action, the Act willrequire the reduction. When the Secretary of State mentioned an open door, I took it to mean that we were pushing against a door. If by substantial majority the Scottish Parliament makes a request, will the Government accede to it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have quoted what the Secretary of State said and showed that he did not contradict Lord Sewel. If the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan wanted an answer to that question, he could have written a letter. It is extraordinary that the SNP has used the Committee's time in such a way. As ever, SNP Members are interested only in finding out how many angels can dance on the head of a constitutional pin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Occasionally, I go into a hostelry, where I hear many subjects being discussed. Sometimes the nearest that the discussions get to politics is the mention of the name of Martin O'Neill. However, I have never heard anyone discuss whether there should be 129 or 104 or 258 MSPs. The entire Scottish nation may be agog with those questions in six years' time, but for the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues to talk now only about a hypothetical constitutional issue that that will not arise for another seven year is fantastic. That is the most eloquent comment on what the Scottish Nationalists have to offer the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) has deployed the reasons why we take the view that the present number of Members of the Scottish

Parliament is likely to be right, but the one time to consider altering the number under the Scotland Act would seem firmly not to be now. We are awaiting the report of the Kerley committee and the decision of the Scottish Executive and Parliament upon the future boundaries of local government. We would be well advised, when considering the possible need for realignment, to take account of the number of Members at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. No case can be made—we certainly heard no attempt to adduce one—for the month of June 2000 being an appropriate time to discuss that subject. The nationalists have made not the slightest attempt to present a case. Not only is it a fantastically important and relevant subject, it is the most fantastically important and relevant subject. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood mentioned the national minimum wage, my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) mentioned pensions, and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton mentioned employment legislation. There are many challenges and problems in Scotland that we could be discussing today, yet the nationalists want to discuss a hypothetical constitutional issue that will not arise until 2007—by which time there will be immensely more evidence to take into account than can conceivably exist now. It is the party of utter irrelevance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to speak on this important issue. Responsibilities in the Scottish Parliament prevent me from attending this Parliament as often as I should like. Indeed, I am one Johnny who would not like to be described as coming occasionally. During the fusillade of fire directed at the Scottish National party for its poor attendance in the Scottish Parliament, I realised what it must be like to be under friendly fire, because I am often in the same position. The problem is that we cannot be in two places at the same time. All Members of the Scottish Parliament have a poor record of attendance at this Parliament. Therefore, I am grateful to have the opportunity to debate civil service jobs in Dundee in the Westminster Parliament, especially because I have been trying to raise the matter in the Scottish Parliament for a long time. This is one issue on which Westminster is delivering ahead of Holyrood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not operating as a lone maverick. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) has also campaigned on the lack of Government jobs in Dundee and Tayside. Successive administrations of Dundee city council have consistently supported us. We have written to Ministers, tabled parliamentary questions and led delegations to press on Ministers the importance of giving Dundee more civil service jobs, both before and after devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that he has all-party support across Tayside for his campaign? The debate is on civil service jobs in Dundee. Although I support the campaign for more civil service jobs in Dundee, I also want more civil service jobs in the whole of Tayside, which has been badly let down in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West, the MSP for Dundee, West, Kate MacLean, and I recently added our support to an initiative fronted by Scottish Enterprise Tayside that fights for more civil service jobs for Tayside as a whole. The initiative has brought together Members of Parliament, MSPs, the three Tayside councils and the Tayside chambers of commerce. All parties are united to argue the case for more civil service jobs in Dundee and Tayside. I do not accept that Dundee's case for more civil service jobs is weakened by the joint campaign. On the contrary, I think that it has strengthened our case. Dundee is a significant regional centre. It influences Angus, Perthshire and extensive areas of Fife. More civil service jobs in Dundee and the recognised multiplier effect that is associated with the presence of Government offices would have an impact on the regional economy of Tayside. What is good for Dundee is good for Tayside, and what is good for
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
Tayside is good for Dundee. The debate is raised in the context of a wider campaign for more civil service jobs in Tayside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for Dundee is powerful. It has long been recognised as one of the four major cities in Scotland, yet it has the lowest share of civil service employment of any Scottish town with a population in excess of 40,000—a quite staggering statistic. Cabinet Office figures in April 1999 showed Dundee as having just 1,000 civil service jobs. Aberdeen had twice as many and has since been awarded a new Food Standards Agency office in preference to Dundee. Glasgow had nearly 12,000 civil service jobs and Edinburgh about 13,000. In fact, East Kilbride, Dunfermline and Cumbernauld all had more civil service jobs than Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stark as those figures are, the situation is even bleaker if we consider the number of jobs per thousand of population. On that measure, Dundee trails behind the places that I have mentioned and also Ayr, Inverness, Greenock and Livingston. It is not necessary to be paranoid or to have a conspiracy theory to recognise that Dundee is not getting its fair share of civil service jobs. The Government at Westminster and the Executive at Holyrood must address the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various arguments have been used over the years to explain away the low number of civil service jobs in Dundee. We have been told, for example, that the civil service must be physically close to Ministers in Edinburgh and other major centres of government. How else could they keep in contact with Ministers? That argument has been rendered redundant by the revolution in information technology, which has made available e-mails, voice mail, video conferencing, the internet and other means by which civil servants can keep in contact with Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making valid points about the technology revolution, but there are more traditional issues regarding, for example, the ability of public transport to provide the infrastructure by which people can get into Dundee as a commuter hub as easily as they can get into Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a public transport dimension, which must be addressed if the other issues are to be more easily considered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I intend to refer to public transport. As the current television advert says, "You can get the meeting to come to you. You don't have to go to the meeting." It is possible these days to arrange such things. Civil servants are no longer required to be physically close to Ministers or to parliamentary politicians generally in the modern age. Virtual meetings are a reality. They cost less, are easier to convene and are more in keeping with the age in which we live—and I speak as someone not usually accused of being a moderniser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been argued that Dundee lacks office accommodation of the right quality for government jobs. If that was ever true, it certainly is not true now.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Dundee has arguably the best waterfront site in Europe, zoned for office development. The site has preserved employment zone benefits and is adjacent both to Dundee station and to one of the major routes in and out of the city centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dundee has many other advantages. The cost of living in Dundee is estimated to be about 10 per cent. lower than that in the rest of the United Kingdom. Average office costs in Dundee are significantly lower than elsewhere in the UK. A recent report estimated that Edinburgh's office costs are 37 per cent. higher than Dundee's. Labour turnover is less than 5 per cent. while the Scottish average is 12 per cent. and the United Kingdom average 16 per cent. Ninety per cent. of Scotland's population is within a 90-minute drive of Dundee. We have an airport. We are on the east coast rail main line. We have a port, and access to the rest of Scotland, the United Kingdom and Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to Dundee makes good sense not only for Dundee but for Departments, however the situation is considered. Why do jobs not come in sufficient numbers? We have raised the matter with Ministers at Holyrood and at Westminster. The Executive's reply talked about a new policy, which was described as the dispersal of civil service jobs. It stressed the Executive's commitment to decentralising Government as part of a wider vision of making Government more accessible, open and responsible. I trust that Departments and Ministers in the Westminster Parliament share that policy aim. The Scottish Executive decided that there should be a presumption against location in Edinburgh when a new unit or agency was established and when existing units were merged or otherwise reorganised. It also decided that relocation outside Edinburgh would be considered when leases run out. Final decisions about relocation will depend on factors such as costs, operational effectiveness and the position of the staff affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Westminster Departments cannot adopt a policy as focused as the Executive's policy for relocation from Edinburgh. Edinburgh is the seat of Government for the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament; Westminster operates according to different circumstances. Nevertheless, I ask that Westminster Departments take a policy decision so that parts of the country that traditionally have not had their fair share of civil service jobs, and which offer clear advantages to the Government and to the taxpayer, are considered when new agency units are established or existing ones relocated. Dundee is just such an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West and I wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland as part of our campaign on civil service jobs. He replied saying that UK Departments had bases across Scotland and that decisions about further relocations would be the responsibility of individual Departments and agencies That is exactly right but the Secretary of State is not without influence on those bodies and their Ministers. He is Scotland's man in the Cabinet, I am pleased to say, and he liaises both with Cabinet Ministers and with Ministers in the Scottish Executive. He knows
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
that the Executive are moving towards dispersing civil service jobs away from traditional centres and to new locations. He knows that they are doing so to make Government in Scotland more accessible, open and responsive. Would he and other Ministers want anything less for Westminster Government? We hear talk of joined-up Government; there is a case for saying that the dispersal policy should permeate throughout Government, north and south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Executive have established a dispersal unit within their wider administration services unit to promote further dispersal of civil service jobs across Scotland. Is it not possible to establish an equivalent unit in the Cabinet Office to consider and promote dispersal of Westminster civil service jobs not only to Dundee and Scotland but throughout the United Kingdom? The days are over when citizens of this country are content to accept rule from London or, for that matter, from Edinburgh. Every decision at every level of Government is open to challenge. Every politician, civil servant and official will be held to account for decisions taken on our behalf and for the way in which they spend our money. If ever there was deference to political rule from above, such an attitude no longer exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been trying to make the case for Dundee as an attractive location for government and civil service jobs. I hope that I have convinced the Minister that Dundee has a strong case. I have left until last the best part of the case: the people of Dundee. The city has had to cope with change, adapting and constantly redefining itself as the old industries and certainties disappeared. The people there have seen the collapse of employment in the once all-powerful jute industry. We have seen the disappearance of the new light industries brought in to replace jute. Not so long ago, firms such as Timex were pivotal to the local economy, but they have disappeared.. We have seen the closure of the shipyards, spiralling unemployment and poverty. Yet the city has continued to find new ways in which to make its way in the world. It is still a first-class centre for manufacturing employment, with major companies such as NCR and Michelin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dundee has also become a leader in cancer research, attracting some of the best and brightest minds from around the world. It has two excellent universities and one of the finest teaching hospitals in the United Kingdom. It has a hugely successful college of education. It has a leading Scottish arts centre and one of the best repertory theatres to be found anywhere in Scotland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, Dundee has fought back against the odds and has not always had the government support that it deserved. The city is not asking for special treatment or favours. It is simply asking for fairness—a fair share of the jobs paid for by taxpayers, including Dundee taxpayers. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond positively on the way in which Government can begin to make a direct difference to the dispersal of civil service jobs away from traditional centres to those parts of the country that desperately need them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7.13 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) on his success in obtaining the Adjournment debate and on the articulate and effective way in which he has put his case. It will come as no surprise to him to hear me say that I have enormous sympathy with that case, which has great validity. My relationship with Dundee goes back a long way and I have witnessed many of the changes to which my hon. Friend referred. I endorse everything that he said about the excellence of the city and the quality of its people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want also to recognise how assiduous my hon. Friend has been in pursuing jobs for Dundee and the dispersal of civil service jobs in particular. On 29 February this year, he wrote to the Secretary of State about dispersal and other public agency jobs in Tayside. He has also written twice to the Scottish Executive about civil services jobs, in December 1999 and April 2000, and tabled a parliamentary question, which was answered last month. I think that that is the way in which the process must continue—it is a matter for a campaign rather than for an instant fix.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the statistics confirm that Dundee's share of Government jobs is the lowest among Scotland's major town and cities. As my hon. Friend said, there are 117 Scottish Executive staff in Dundee, which is eight per 10,000 head of population. Aberdeen has 501 staff, which is 24 per 10,000 head of population; Falkirk has 369 staff, which is 26 per 10,000; Glasgow has 1,605 staff, which is 26 per 10,000; and Edinburgh has 6,882, which is 153 per 10,000. Quite a lot of places that do not feature on that list would share exactly the same sentiments about the lack of dispersal. Indeed, my own constituency might be included among them. There is no doubt that the establishment of the Scottish Parliament and Executive has created high expectation in many parts of Scotland about the potential for dispersal. My hon. Friend's basic point is right: Dundee, with 117 Scottish Executive staff—8 per 10,000 head of population—clearly does not get a good throw of the dice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that the Cabinet Office estimate of the number of civil service jobs in Dundee was about 1,000. That coincides with my own information. Between 1997 and 1999, the number increased by 66, from 951 to 1,017. I am not claiming that as a triumph or exoneration; I merely offer it as another interesting statistical fact. I shall return later to my hon. Friend's specific question, but I can set his comments in the context of the Dundee unemployment statistics, which are undeniably high compared with the Scottish average. In April, there were 2,800 unemployed people in Dundee, East, which is 7.5 per cent. of the working age group. In the city as a whole, the proportion was also 7.5 per cent. of the working age group. That compares with a Scottish rate of 4.9 per cent. Relatively high unemployment has persisted in Dundee, although it is obviously far below the levels of a few years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
On that more positive note, unemployment in Dundee city has fallen by 10 per cent. since April last year, while in Scotland as a whole it has fallen by 11 per cent. In Dundee, it has fallen by 27 per cent. since April 1997, as opposed to 26 per cent. in Scotland as a whole. In relative terms, the situation is not getting worse, but I fully accept that unemployment in Dundee remains a significant problem in absolute terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as if nothing has been done to address the problem. As both my hon. Friend and our mutual hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) know well, I spent a lot of time in Dundee during the early years of the current Administration because of the designation of Tayside as a new deal pathfinder area. We launched the scheme in January 1998 and it pioneered development of the new deal. More important, it has since helped almost 25,000 young Scots into jobs. The Tayside and Dundee pathfinder was one of the 12 new deal pathfinders in the United Kingdom and the only Scottish one. It was also one of the best performing projects in the country. As I have done on many previous occasions, I pay tribute to everyone who was involved in the introduction of the new deal in Tayside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new deal has made an important contribution to solving the problems, especially in the battle against youth unemployment. Unemployment among young people has fallen by 70 per cent. in my hon. Friend's constituency since April 1997 and by 75 per cent. across the city. Again, I recognise that more has to be done. We are committed to improving and expanding the new deal and to intensifying the gateway for people on new deal 25-plus to provide highly personalised support in overcoming barriers to work, which is especially significant in a place such as Dundee. The further the clientele of the new deal is extended, the more necessary it is to take the special measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a list of good news on the job front in Dundee, on: Macfarlane Packaging, ADT, WL Gore, Argonex Discovery, R&M Engineering and the positive indications on assisted area status for Dundee. Hon. Members are familiar with that. However, although that forms part of the story, it is not the whole story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the disappointment felt in Dundee when it failed to win the Scottish headquarters of the Food Standards Agency. As a result, 40 to 45 jobs went to Aberdeen. The decision was a matter for the Scottish Executive. My hon. Friend is well placed to raise the issue in the appropriate quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The First Minister made a statement on the Scottish Executive's policy on the location and relocation of public service jobs in Scotland in the Scottish Parliament on 15 September 1999. The objective of the policy is to promote efficiency and effectiveness and the jobs should be located close to the communities they serve. Significantly, in the context of the debate, there will be a presumption in future against location in Edinburgh when a new unit or agency is being established or an existing unit being merged or reorganised. That offers an opportunity for Dundee in particular and other communities that feel similarly disadvantaged. Relocation will be considered at significant property break-points in leases. That offers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
another opportunity for the whole apparatus of local government and enterprise companies working with my hon. Friends. They should keep a close eye on what is coming up and consider where campaigns can be mounted most effectively to persuade agencies whose leases are about to end that Dundee is a suitable location. The question of costs and operational effectiveness and the position of staff concerned will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to United Kingdom Departments, there is, at present, no coordinated initiative to relocate Government jobs to the regions, and relocation is a matter at present for individual departments and agencies. No targets or systems are in place for monitoring decentralisation or relocation. As my hon. Friend recognised, the Scotland Office is perhaps not the best place to start the campaign because it does not have a large number of staff to decentralise anyway. However, we can move staff around between Glasgow, Edinburgh and London in order to create the impression of great numbers. The Scotland Office has few staff that it could decentralise to Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend rightly pointed out that the Secretary of State and the Scotland Office in Whitehall have influence. They can raise Dundee's case and
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
promote its advantages. I undertake to do that. In that spirit and in response to the debate, I offer to write to ministerial colleagues in United Kingdom Departments with offices in Scotland and to the Scottish Executive, reinforcing his own efforts to draw attention to Dundee's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also propose that my hon. Friend and his fellow Tayside Members continue to be assiduous in selling the virtues of Dundee as a site for the relocation of civil service jobs in key United Kingdom Departments such as the Ministry of Defence, the Department for Social Security, the Employment Service, the Inland Revenue, and Customs and Excise. Until now, they have assiduously pursued that objective with the Scottish Executive. It is difficult to say more than that, but I hope my remarks are at least mildly helpful. The purpose of the debate is to draw attention to the problem rather than to create the solution. I assure my hon. Friend that I will do what I can. I am prepared to work with him and will be happy to meet him and other Tayside Members to discuss further measures to promote Dundee's advantages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
