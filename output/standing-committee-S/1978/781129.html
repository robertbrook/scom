DRAFT EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES (SERVICES OF LAWYERS) ORDER 1978</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Mr. Peter Archer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft European Communities (Services of Lawyers) Order 1978.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that one does not have to gain to have a financial interest. I read law, but I have not practised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of that comment, I should declare an interest in the light of certain eventualities which may or may not take place.<br><br>
The purpose of the order is to implement our obligations under the European Communities Council Directive No. 77/249 which the House discussed on 12th November 1976. It relates to the provision of services on a temporary basis in one member State by lawyers qualified in another.<br><br>
Under article 59 of the Treaty of Rome member States have committed themselves to liberalising services within the Community. The directive is a limited instance of that commitment. It is concerned not with mutual recognition of qualifications, with lawyers establishing themselves in practice in other States, or with the right of establishment, but with visits for specific business.<br><br>
Broadly, the directive requires each member State to recognise as lawyers entitled to practise law within their territories certain categories of lawyers from other States. For that purpose, each State is required to modify those rules and practices of its national law which reserve the provision of certain legal services to people holding certain professional qualifications.<br><br>
When we discussed the directive in 1976 there was general agreement that any relaxation of restrictions among lawyers might give rise to problems which do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
always arise in relation to most other professions. The human anatomy is similar in the United Kingdom or in Germany, so a doctor qualified in one country may be permitted to practise in another subject only to allowing for differences in structure of the medical profession. But legal systems are different, so a lawyer qualified under one legal system may have no expertise in another. The right hon. and learned Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) in the debate on the directive, said that in a sense the practice of law in the United Kingdom and the practice of law in Germany were two separate professions.<br><br>
The purpose of the directive is to liberalise restrictions as far as possible. The intention is that, where necessary or appropriate, members of the public should have access to advice from or representation by lawyers whose principal expertise is in a different legal system, and that lawyers should have the opportunity of exercising their talents outside the territorial jurisdiction of their own courts.<br><br>
The order implements those provisions in relation to lawyers from other member States practising in the United Kingdom. Other States are making similar provisions.<br><br>
Articles 5 and 8 of the order enact the relaxation. Article 5 provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"No enactment or rule of law or practice shall prevent an EEC lawyer from providing any service in relation to any proceedings, whether civil or criminal"</p></blockquote>
in England, Wales or Scotland, subject to certain conditions. Broadly, one can say that deals with what solicitors know as contentious business.<br><br>
Article 8 makes similar provision in relation to the drawing up or preparing of certain classes of document. Therefore, one can say that refers to non-contentious business, although only a very limited sector of it.<br><br>
The removal of restrictions in article 5 is subject to a number of limitations. First, it is subject to the provision that the visiting lawyer shall be instructed by, and act in conjunction with a lawyer who is entitled to practice before the court in question and who could properly provide that service. The home lawyer with whom he would be acting obviously would have a high degree of control. If he found that the visiting lawyer was not conducting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0326">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
the matter properly, he could withdraw from the case and the visiting lawyer could not proceed unless he found another home lawyer.<br><br>
Article 6 ensures that it shall be clear in what capacity the visiting lawyer is acting. For example, in England he cannot act both as a barrister and a solicitor, and in Scotland in the equivalent capacities, and he cannot alternate between the two capacities in the same proceedings.<br><br>
Under article 5, hon. Members will notice that an EEC lawyer is not prevented from appearing
<br><blockquote><p>"by reason only that he is not an advocate, barrister or solicitor".</p></blockquote>
But he may be prevented from appearing for any other proper reason—for example, incompetence or unfamiliarity with the English language.<br><br>
Article 8—the non-contentious business provision—is of limited effect in any event because, even now, only a limited number of advisory and drafting services are reserved to lawyers qualified here. Such matters normally require expert knowledge of domestic law. Article 8, is, of course, limited to the preparation of documents about interests in personal estate.<br><br>
Article 9 provides that the EEC lawyer is not to be entitled to draft documents relating to interests in land or to the estates of deceased persons.<br><br>
Those are the liberalising provisions and their qualifications.<br><br>
Article 7 prohibits an EEC lawyer in salaried employment from providing services on behalf of his employer, when acting with an advocate or barrister, which that advocate or barrister could not properly provide if he were simply employed.<br><br>
Article 10 makes legal aid available in cases involving representation or advice by an EEC lawyer where appropriate, but I cannot believe that is likely to be appropriate in a wide sector of cases.<br><br>
Article 2 relates to the definition of the expression "EEC lawyer". It does not include all types of lawyers in the Community. It is confined to those with rights of audience or representation in their respective member States. For example, it does not include the French conseil juridique whose capacity is purely advisory.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
The article is drafted to give a particular designation to that part of the United Kingdom to which it applies.<br><br>
Articles 12 to 17 relate to the verification of the status of visiting lawyers and to disciplinary matters. Those hon. Members who participated in the earlier discussions in 1976 will remember that article 4 of the directive laid down a basic framework of professional conduct. It provided that a lawyer visiting for purposes of representation shall be subject to the rules of the host State and that a lawyer visiting for other purposes shall be subject to the rules of professional conduct of the country in which he qualified. That was not felt to be wholly sufficient. Therefore, article 4(4) of the directive subjects visiting lawyers to certain rules operative in the host country even when they are not participating in proceedings here.<br><br>
This order does not seek to spell out those disciplinary matters which are applicable in the United Kingdom. In effect, it is content to leave them to the appropriate disciplinary authorities here and simply confers jurisdiction on the disciplinary authorities.<br><br>
That is the scheme of the order. We are under an obligation to implement the directive before 26th March 1979. Hon. Members will not be surprised to hear that it was not felt proper to proceed by way of a designation order and regulations. The House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities said that the appropriate way to proceed was by Order in Council under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act. The Government felt it right to do that, and to use the affirmative resolution procedure. The draft has been submitted with a memorandum to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and that Committee has approved it.<br><br>
The order was drafted in full consultation with the United Kingdom professional bodies. The problem is not to protect United Kingdom lawyers from competition. I believe that they are not afraid to compete with any other legal profession. Nor, in fairness, do I believe that the legal professions of other European member States are concerned to poach work in the United Kingdom. The problem was simply to ensure that the public should have access to the widest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0327">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
range of expertise, whilst ensuring that they should not be exposed to offers of services by those not competent to provide them. I believe that the directive as implemented in this order achieves that purpose.</span></p>
<p>10.41 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percy Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I declare an interest as I think that most of us in the Committee this morning must declare an interest, because I am a practising member of the Bar.<br><br>
I welcome this order. It seems to me that it deals with the problem which we have to face under the Community regulations in a conservative manner. It provides very proper and appropriate safeguards for discipline, and it limits, in effect, the scope of the exercise of their professional expertise of those coming here who are not qualified in English law to aid those who are qualified in English law. That seems to me to put in a pithy form the essence of these regulations.<br><br>
We in this country have always adopted a far more liberal approach to the exercise by foreigners in our midst of professional qualifications than any other country that I know. Certainly, for many years there have practised at the English Bar in London distinguished foreigners who have qualified and been called to the English Bar. It would not be necessary for me to recite names, but there must be well known to many hon. Members some of the distinguished Frenchmen who have been called to the English Bar and who, over the years, have fulfilled a very important role in cases of conflict of laws involving French law arising in the English courts. The same has applied to Spanish lawyers and, to my certain knowledge, to Italian lawyers.<br><br>
This has been a far more liberal approach than was ever applied, until we entered the European Communities, by the other countries. For instance, in France, although one might have qualified as a French barrister, it was not possible to be called to the Paris Bar and to practise in French courts unless one was a Frenchman. Before we entered the Community, there were distinguished English lawyers in Paris practising the law, but they could practise only in an advisory capacity, whereas in London French law-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
yers, having been called to the English Bar, were able to appear in our courts.<br><br>
That situation has been ended by the overall arrangements which now prevail within the Community. It is possible for a Frenchman to be called to the English Bar and to practise here, and for an Englishman to be called to the French Bar and to practise there. This order, of course, does not deal with that situation; it deals with a person who is not qualified in English law in England. I imagine that the same rules <i>mutatis mutandis</i> will prevail in other countries. It seems to me that there obviously has to be a limitation upon the scope of the exercise of their abilities by such persons.<br><br>
On the other hand, there may well arise a real need for such services in an ever-increasingly integrated Community. I mean integrated not in any constitutional sense but in the sense in which the mere fact of the existence of the Community is likely to give rise over the years to more and more cases which have a Community law or a foreign law element. In this context, by "foreign law" I mean the law of one of the other countries of the Community.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General, in his brief and cogent speech, said that, in his view, there would be little call for the legal aid provision. I am not so sure, because it seems to me that it is precisely in the realm of family law, as well as in that of commercial law, that we are likely to see the position arise in our courts—or in the drawing-up of legal instruments in this country—in which the services of somebody from another country within the Community might be needed. That might be when a marriage between an Englishman and a Frenchwoman, or an Italian woman and an Englishman, and so on, has gone on the rocks and problems have arisen that require to be dealt with in court, for example, over property and the custody of children.<br><br>
In such cases, there may well be a call for legal aid. At any rate, it is provided for, and therefore, while many cases will involve substantial sums of money and legal aid would not arise, I suspect that we shall see article 10 put into operation in some cases in the Family Division involving family problems.<br><br>
I welcome the order and hope that it will meet with the Committee's approval.</span></p>

<p>10.47 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce Douglas-Mann</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a practising solicitor, I should declare the same interest as other hon. Members.<br><br>
My right hon. and learned Friend referred particularly to visiting lawyers. Will not this order, in practice, apply also to those qualified in the law of an EEC State who are permanently resident in the United Kingdom? Is it really necessary for us to have quite such a rigid rule that a client must instruct a solicitor? Assuming that there were a foreign element in the matter, the client initially would have to instruct a solicitor in this country, because an English barrister would not be able to accept instructions other than through a solicitor. He would then have to instruct a United Kingdom barrister and, again assuming that the case involved the foreign element that made the attendance of the EEC lawyer necessary, the second advocate. That seems to me to be unnecessarily cumbersome and expensive in many cases.<br><br>
I once had the experience of representing somebody who was on a disciplinary charge under the United States Army regulations in Germany. It was the very interesting experience of finding myself dealing with a case before a completely different tribunal. The defending officer allocated to the case had been used to having the function of acting both as the investigator and as the advocate. We settled very rapidly and happily into our roles; I was the instructing solicitor and he dealt with the advocacy. The consequence proved to a large extent the merits of the division of the profession. However, it seems to me unnecessary for there to have to be three lawyers in a case where matters may be relatively simple so far as the EEC element is concerned, yet which requires the assistance of an EEC lawyer, who may have been practising in and regularly appearing in British courts. It is not possible to have something falling short of qualifying as a barrister in Britain, something which would enable an EEC lawyer who was regularly appearing here to dispense with the need for a second British barrister to appear in the case, provided that—and this would be necessary, I think—a British firm of solicitors was involved in the case if it was taking place in the British courts? I do not want to see the order used, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
effect, as a further restrictive practice for the benefit of the profession.</span></p>
<p>10.50 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Winifred Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add my voice to the sentiments of the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann), I must also declare an interest as a practising solicitor in Scotland and as former secretary and president of the Glasgow Bar Association. That association was a fairly radical one which had among its aims and objects the end of the division of the profession in Scotland. Indeed in Scotland, with such a small legal profession in a country of five million people, the division of the profession is a nonsense.<br><br>
In Scotland there are less than 300 active advocates—or barristers, as they are called in England—and there is a carve-up of all the perks and the jobs among them. The 3,000 solicitors have only recently had any share of appointments to the shrival bench, which is unique to Scotland but is something above a county court judge. The Committee must bear in mind that the sheriff in Scotland enjoys a much wider criminal and civil jurisdiction than any equivalent in England, so it is difficult to give an exact comparison.<br><br>
It is only because of the work of the Glasgow Bar Association—which, although it has the name " Glasgow" has attracted to its ranks solicitors engaged in court practice from all over Scotland—that we have had shrival appointments from the solicitor branch of the profession. It would be odd if all the talent resided in the 300 and very little resided in the 3,000.<br><br>
I know that England is a much bigger context, and that the fusion of the profession there may not have the attractions that it has in a small country such as Scotland, with its unique system of law and where we hope that enough human mischief will turn up to keep the law turning round, as it were. It always has until now. Nevertheless, there is that problem in such a small country.<br><br>
We are very proud of our law in Scotland. You, Mr. English, are probably familiar with the story of the Lord Advocate of Scotland and the Lord Chancellor of England who had a conversation about why the laws were not the same. The Lord Advocate of Scotland
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0329">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
agreed that it was a very good idea that they should be the same, but said, "Would it not be very difficult to persuade the English to adopt Scots law?" That remains our position.<br><br>
I am very disturbed to have before me this document which perpetuates the division of the profession. As I understand article 5, we will have solicitors requiring advocates—I will call them barristers. That is a victory for the vested interests of the profession, and in Scottish terms it is really the triumph of the very few over the very many. It is certainly not acceptable to the solicitor branch of the profession in Scotland. At least, it is not acceptable to the solicitor branch except for the Edinburgh post-box lawyers, who live on the backs of solicitors from the rest of Scotland.<br><br>
We already have tremendous proof that it is only a matter of time before this division of the profession in Scotland becomes a total nonsense, with divorce cases almost certainly coming to the sheriff court. It sounds crude to say it, but it is as simple as that. When divorce goes to the sheriff court the privilege of the Bar and the 300 will disintegrate in such a small country.<br><br>
In England, the position is different because there is a much larger population. It is possibly justifiable to say that there could be a reason for keeping a small number of specialist court pleaders under restrictive practices. But it makes no sense in Scotland.<br><br>
We in Scotland look to the European Community with a certain degree of homeness because, after all, we have a European system of law. We thought that this would be a wonderful moment. I do not suppose that there will be many instances of EEC lawyers wanting to come to Scotland or, alternatively of Scottish lawyers wanting to go to Belgium or wherever it may be, but there will be some. We thought that the division within the profession would go when dealing with EEC matters. But no, lo and behold!, the division is to be maintained. Someone has been very effective in lobbying the Government. I cannot possibly support an order which perpetuates such an absurdity for Scotland, because it makes no sense.<br><br>
I recommend to the Committee a book by an American lawyer, Louie Auchen-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
loss, entitled "Powers of Attorney". After all, America adopted the English system for most of its States. Nevertheless, it threw out the division of the profession for practical reasons. The book describes an American court community where specialisation goes to the top. The court specialist will always be sought after in special cases. We have that in Scotland also. When real skill is required it will not always be a member of the advocates' section who is sought after.<br><br>
I suggest that in an EEC matter it will probably be a case of specialisation rising to the top. In a European case, to whom will people look if they need a Scottish lawyer? They will probably look for a specialist pleader.<br><br>
If we abolished the division of the profession, it would not end specialisation rising to the top. There would still be the court lawyer who would say "I am for hire." He could be in his own chambers or in someone else's, but he would still be for hire for his skill. It is deplorable that, when we have a new window on the world of law, we should perpetuate the absurdities of our system.<br><br>
One of the disadvantages that we got from the Union was a divided profession. In legal terms, England has much to answer for and much to thank Scotland for. For this position to be perpetuated in the modern world makes a nonsense of radical thought.<br><br>
In European terms the Scottish system is unique. We have a European system because we had our law before the union with England. We were sharing a European experience. We were borrowing the best ideas of European law. Our professors in our four universities—we had four when England had two—were exchanging ideas with professors in all parts of Europe. Our students were studying in European universities. That was part of the European tradition. We are now, by this/new development, back in Europe again, so to speak, after our trauma of union with England, but we are being kept in the middle ages because of this ridiculous fusion of the profession.<br><br>
I know that substantial sections of the English legal profession agree with me about the fusion of the profession. I do not know how powerful they are. I have no way of knowing, because I do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0330">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
practise in England. But I certainly could not give my approval to an order which perpetuates this absurdity. I cannot speak so confidently for England, although I have been in touch with a body which believes in the fusion of the profession. But it is a nonsense in Scotland. We are now in Europe. I could not possibly agree with this proposal in a European situation.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) highlighted the possibilities which could arise. It might be a conflict of law on a family matter, although in my view it is more likely to be a company matter on a question of competition. In a family matter it is absurd that a solicitor should have to find an advocate and increase the expense to the State or the private pocket as the case may be. The Europeans think it is a nonsense. I serve on the Legal Committee of the European Parliament. Members there are in wonderment at our division of the profession. That is the only way to describe their attitude. I meet distinguished jurists from Italy, Germany and all the member States. I repeat, they are in wonderment that we have perpetuated this division. For those reasons, I could not possibly give my stamp of imprimatur, for what it is worth, to the order.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I declare my interest as a lawyer. I also declare my interest in the wide implications of the order for the lay client. I was glad that the right hon. and learned Solicitor-General stressed that matter. We are concerned not with a carving up exercise, but with ensuring that the lay client receives competent advice and representation.<br><br>
People, even in our own profession, sometimes forget that the reserved services about which we are talking are reserved to people by qualification, the qualification being designed to ensure that they are competent. That is fundamental both to our idea of qualifications and to the proposition that certain tasks are reserved to people who hold such qualifications. It is quite wrong to talk about this matter as though it were a carving up exercise. It is nothing of the kind. I think that the Solicitor-General would agree that most of those who practise in the professions are just
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
as keen as any layman to ensure that we adhere to the right approach in considering this matter.<br><br>
I was happy to know that throughout the preparation of the agreement on the directive and the preparation of this order there has been very close co-operation and consultation with the two branches of the profession and that they are reasonably content with what has emerged.<br><br>
I was also glad that the Solicitor-General made the point so firmly that, when considering the lawyers of Europe, we must recognise that we are talking about different professions in the different countries. After all, what is a profession? It is a body of people who have a particular qualification, that qualification making them competent to give advice and representation. The legal systems of Europe are so different that those qualifications must of necessity be different. Therefore, by definition, they are not the same professions. They are all lawyers, because they are all concerned with the law of their respective countries, but that is the only way in which they can be said to be the same.<br><br>
It is important to recognise that an underlying assumption is made in the directive from which the order springs—namely, that the "activities of lawyers" are so similar in all EEC countries that a lawyer in one country should be entitled to be "recognised" for "the purpose of pursuing the activities of lawyers " in another country. Those words come from the directive.<br><br>
For the reasons I have indicated, I believe that that is not just a false assumption but a very dangerous one. It is based, I think, on the belief that a lawyer is a lawyer is a lawyer, just as a doctor is a doctor is a doctor. But it is a complete fallacy. A hernia is a hernia is a hernia and requires the same kind of expertise and technology wherever it is suffered and wherever it is treated. Likewise with engineers, a bridge is a bridge is a bridge wherever it is being built and requires the same kind of expertise and technology.<br><br>
I am not saying that the expertise or technology is identical, but the problem is the same. But the same does not apply to lawyers. The problem with which a lawyer is faced is not by any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0331">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
manner of means the same, unless one puts it in the very general terms that he has to advise his client on what the law is and what his rights are under that law. That is common to all of us, but it is the only thing that is.<br><br>
One need only draw attention to the enormous difference between those countries in which the system of law is what lawyers know as civil law and those in which it is a common law system. They are totally different. On the criminal side, there is the inquisitorial system in most European countries and ours. They are quite different, and they require quite different training and competence.<br><br>
If one approaches the matter as I think one ought to, and as I think most lawyers are entitled to approach it—that when we are talking about qualification we are talking about competence—it becomes quite obvious that competence in one country, entitling a person to be one of those people to whom services are reserved in that country, need not necessarily be any sort of qualification to entitle him to do it in another country. Therefore, if one is thinking, as one ought to be thinking, in terms of a comparable competence, it must be linked to qualification.<br><br>
The weakness of this order is that that qualification does not come into it at all in that sense. There is no reference to a lawyer being properly qualified to do what he is entitled to do in another country. That is a great weakness. I beheve that the Government themselves argued for those propositions. If so, I commend them for doing so by saying gently that I am sorry that they did not stick to them. I say it gently because I appreciate that one cannot always have all that one wants in this world. I think the belief is that the dangers envisaged are in fact covered by a different method here, by the provision that there must be a qualified lawyer acting together with the one who comes to appear in a court in this country.<br><br>
I am not at all clear how that will actually work out. It is a startling proposition that a <i>Rechtsanwalt,</i> which I think is the German equivalent of a barrister, should stand up in an English court and endeavour to present a case. If any <i>Rechtsanwalt</i> should think that I am being rude to them, let me put it the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
other way round and say that it is no less startling a proposition that any one of us here should stand up in a German court and try to present a case according to German law. It may be that the very absurdity of such a proposition will deter people from doing it, so that in fact, for very practical reasons, we shall have what is envisaged here, that if it is thought necessary to bring in a German, French or Italian lawyer in conjunction with an English lawyer, the English lawyer will take the lead.<br><br>
I think the Government would have liked it to be worded so that the lawyer from the other country should be under the control of the lawyer of the host country. I certainly agree with that concept. It was felt that it was not necessary to insist on the word "control", and for practical reasons that is probably right. The practical reasons would produce the same situations if that word was included. I hope so, because unless this provision has the effect that we all expect and hope it will have, there will be a mess, and that does nobody any good. Ridiculous situations arising in the courts do nobody any good. From top to bottom, it does the layman, the system and the lawyers no good.<br><br>
With those reservations, we accept that this was the best that could be done. We hope that it will work, and that a close watch will be kept so that if anything appears to be going wrong we can take early steps to correct it.<br><br>
Referring to the point raised by the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann) I believe that article 6 is designed to avoid the exact situation he would like to see, if I understood him correctly. I agree with the Government on article 6, and one should, at all events at this stage, make clear that the situation I believe he envisaged cannot arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas-Mann</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The situation I envisaged is that a high proportion of cases involving this type of issue are likely to come from a narrow source of firms in Paris, Bonn, and so on, which would rapidly learn which British counsel to instruct to accompany themselves. It therefore seems unnecessary to have an English solicitor intervening to give instructions to the English barrister.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0332">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
Alternatively, the English solicitors may well learn that a particular foreign advocate has the experience to appear in English courts and, therefore, tend to dispense with instructing an English barrister to go with him. Clearly it is essential that on each case there should be one lawyer who is experienced in practising in the tribunal involved, but not necessary to have two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, and it confirms that I understood what the hon. Gentleman said. I thought it right to say that although I see a certain logic to that, it is right that it should be specifically prevented by article 6.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman visualises a situation with an English solicitor and an Italian advocate, or <i>vice versa.</i> He assumes that between them they will be competent to do everything necessary. I do not accept that. Where it is necessary to have both in this country, it is necessary on the basis that one is expert on one aspect, and one is an expert on another. By having the two one has the benefit of competence in both areas. Whether we shall be able to move on from that to something on the lines suggested by the hon. Gentleman after this order has been in effect for a while and an establishment order, if it follows, has been in effect, is another matter. But for the moment I am in agreement with the Government on article 6.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a point that is pertinent to what my hon. and learned Friend said and to the remarks of the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann).<br><br>
For many years, the practice of some of the foreign lawyers practising in London has been very much on the lines proposed in article 6. It has been the practice of many foreign lawyers—I do not say all, but to my knowledge, of some—to advise their continental clients about English law generally. When the matter has proceeded to litigation, although such lawyers have frequently themselves been qualified at the English Bar they have passed the case to an English solicitor who, in due course, has briefed a member of the English Bar to deal with the matter in court. That is my personal knowledge, because frequently I have been the barrister involved. That seems to be a practice
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
—I say this to assist my hon. and learned Friend and the Committee—which is envisaged in article 6.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. and learned Friend. He has stressed the common sense of a practical approach such as he outlined. That is why I said I was not too worried about what would happen. After all, when somebody instructs a lawyer to act for them they want the most sensible combination. Therefore, I think that there may well be little change, for the reasons that were mentioned by my hon. and learned Friend. That is why I am less worried about the word "control" not being there and less worried about the point of qualification having been given up at this stage.<br><br>
Following the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden, the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) made a similar sort of point, though not identical. Although I do not know what happens in Scotland, if the hon. Lady is suggesting that everything that happens in the two halves of the profession—I always speak of the two halves of the profession, not two separate professions—is designed for carving up, I suggest that she look again at the matter. She is being less than generous in what she says.<br><br>
After all, we are professionail people. I should like to mention one aspect of that, namely that we have a qualification which is meant to signify our competence. The other thing that we are supposed to be proud of—and most of us are—is that of putting that competence at the disposal of those who need it. Of course, that will be for a proper fee, when that can be paid. However, the mere fact that we are paid for something should not make people suppose that that is the only consideration.<br><br>
The hon. Lady is less than generous in thinking that the divisions are for the purpose of carving up. Again, I do not know what happens in Scotland but if she were to say "I do not think that these matters should be reserved to lawyers; I think that they should be wide open," that would be one matter. However, the hon. Lady says that all such matters should remain reserve services but, instead of some being reserved to advocates and some to solicitors, they should all be reserved to solicitors.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0333">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
That is another kettle of fish altogether. It is an argument without solution and it will go on for some time. With respect, I do not think that it is relevant to the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I defend my position? The hon. and learned Gentleman is less than generous to me by imagining that it is a matter of fees which motivates my criticism of the division of the profession.<br><br>
Suppose there were a case in Scotland in which someone felt that he required an EEC lawyer from another country in the EEC. We already have something similar to that when English law comes in to our courts and we have an English adviser. So that is not too new to us. If one thought that one needed a lawyer from Italy or Germany, as the case may be, it seems to me to be absurd to have two lawyers helping a third lawyer.<br><br>
I thought that I had made my point about Scotland being a fairly small country compared with England and about the division of the profession being absurd. In my submission, the restrictive practice is hindering help to mankind. I am not against reserving matters to the legal profession. However, I believe that the present position of reserving, for instance, the right to appear in supreme courts to one branch of the legal profession is depriving the public of many skills. That cannot be good. When we multiply that by bringing a European lawyer into our courts, it is making a nonsense of matters.<br><br>
It may be different in England, where there is such a big population that a specialist Bar is required. I am quite prepared to concede that. However, in Scotland, where there is a specialist Bar in Glasgow which does not consist of advocates, that really make a nonsense of matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Lady was going to ask me a question. However, I must try to turn that into—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to defend my position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, if the hon. Lady is talking about restricted rights of audience, that is another matter altogether. We must see that the order does what is necessary in respect of our present system.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
If the hon. Lady succeeded in achieving what she spoke about, and reserved rights of audience went, so that all lawyers in Scotland had the right of audience in all courts, this order would fit that situation as well. She must try to change not the order but the system in Scotland if she wishes to see that rights of audience are not limited to a particular class. With respect, I do not think that point is valid so far as the order in concerned.<br><br>
The best way of ensuring that the necessary competence is available to the lay client in whatever legal process he happens to need the assistance of lawyers, is by relating the order and what we have been talking to the system as it is. That is why we support the order, even though we have considerable misgivings about that underlying assumption.<br><br>
There is one point of detail on the order about which I should like the Solicitor-General to say a word if he can. I refer to the question of professional misconduct and the rules of the professions as distinct from legal qualifications. These are two separate spheres.<br><br>
Article 15 is designed to achieve the objective that the Government desire, by referring to article 4 of the directive. That makes it just that much more difficult to envisage how it will work I say "just that much more difficult" because it is difficult enough in any case.<br><br>
In a way, the Government are ducking the issue. The issue would be easier to understand if it were set out more explicitly. I am not entirely blaming the Government for ducking the issue, if that is not too unfair a description. But I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General would tell us how he visualises it, because this is a matter of immense importance.<br><br>
Lastly, I look ahead to what must come next—an establishment order. To lay the premise for making sure that I am in order, Mr. English, we should be happier about the order if we could have certain assurances about what is to be linked with it. My views about the order are directly related to the assurances that I hope the Solicitor-General will give us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman is trying to obtain information which he should probably get in response to a question to the Attorney-General downstairs.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0334">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether you would give me two minutes or so, Mr. English. I am not being funny about the matter. I believe that it is directly relevant to the order. I have already said that one element of the order disturbs me a little. However, to limit my point to this order alone, I think that we can live with that matter, provided that we are assured that a similar concession is unlikely in the order which I have referred to as an establishment order. It is so closely linked to this order that anything concerned with it is directly related to this matter as well.<br><br>
I ask the Solicitor-General for two assurances. First, if the Government are still in the seat when the further directive is negotiated, will they stress and stick to the proposition that there is no such thing as one profession of lawyers and that it is positively misleading to think of it as such?<br><br>
Secondly, will "proper" qualification be insisted upon? I do not necessarily mean the full examinations and training which our own people have to go through to qualify, but such qualification—and this is the direct link with what I said earlier—as will ensure that that person seeking to practise here under the rights of establishment then granted shall be competent to do so. That is the only way to safeguard the interests of the lay client. Indeed, that is what having a legal system and lawyers is all about.<br><br>
In this order and in the establishment order, we are talking about giving freedom to lawyers to practise in different places. But we must never lose sight of the necessity to protect the person who is seeking the services of a lawyer. Above all, we must ensure that the person who is entitled to give those services is competent to do so. I see no way of doing that save by introducing an element of necessary qualification. With those reservations, we support the Government on this order.</span></p>
<p>11.25 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly agree without reservation with the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) that we are discussing a matter of competence. That is what the order is about. I go part of the way with him that is a matter of competence in what are, essentially, different professions. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
would be churlish of me, now that he has agreed with my original remarks, to resile from those remarks.<br><br>
I hope that we do not over-dramatise or get to carried away. The difference between a lawyer in the United Kingdom and a German lawyer is not quite the same as the difference between a lawyer in the United Kingdom and a veterinary surgeon. If a lawyer wanted to transfer from his profession to the other, he would need to go back to basic principles and start again. However, skills and principles are common to law wherever it is practised. Some matters of detail are common to both professions.<br><br>
Any assurance which I gave the hon. and learned Member for Southport about the Government's attitude in any future negotiations would have to be fitted into the whole of that context. But I would not be giving any hostages to fortune by saying that uppermost in the minds of all concerned is that, if someone is permitted to practise law in this country, we must ensure that he is properly qualified to do so. I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman that that is what this order is all about.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman has, I believe, recognised that those who negotiated the directive and drafted this order have tried to keep in mind the proper balance between ensuring that people have access to the widest possible range of skills without exposing the public in one country to offers of assistance from people in another country who do not have the requisite expertise. But I assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that we shall watch this matter. If there is a problem, clearly we should be ready to recognise and correct it.<br><br>
I urge on the Committee, as did the hon. and learned Member for Southport, the fairly limited purpose of the order. It has not been often in my experience that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) and my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann) have combined to make what was in many ways the same point.<br><br>
I do not want to misrepresent the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn. I am sure, that uppermost in her mind was the virtue of a divided profession against the public interest in possible fusion. I do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0335">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
not think that we should embark on a debate on that matter today, if only because of the extensive debate which has been in progress in both Scotland and England for some substantial time. If I attempted to rehearse either side of the argument, it would take more time than is available this morning. However, without appearing to be patronising, I think that the hon. Lady put forward a very powerful case for fusion, and I will try to ensure that in all the areas where that debate is being continued what she has said today is brought to the attention of those who are concerned with it. Further than that I hope she will not ask me to go. I cannot believe that it would be welcomed if an English law officer were today to pronounce on how the Scottish legal profession should organise itself.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden was making a more limited point. He asked whether, within the confines of what is happening here, it is always essential that if an EEC lawyer is brought into a case for perfectly good reasons he ought to be brought in in conjunction with two lawyers in this country. I can see the force of the argument. I think it would be very difficult to separate what we are trying to do in this order implementing the directive from the whole debate which is going on about the merits of fusion as against a divided profession. I hope he will accept that.<br><br>
A Royal Commission is considering exactly these points, and this may be a point worth making to the commission. But until the Royal Commission has reported and we are in a position to consider its recommendations, I doubt whether we ought to make inroads on rules which already exist. Certainly I think that the profession holds that view.<br><br>
Perhaps I may add that there is a technical point here, too. I hope that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn will not condemn the order because we have not dealt with the question of fusion. This is an order under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act, and the only power that we have under that subsection is to implement Community obligations. So we cannot go further than the directive, in any event. But I do not want to rest my case purely on a technical point.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Even if it were possible for us to legislate more widely than that, I would venture to suggest to the Committee that this is not the occasion to do it because the purposes of what we are doing are very much more limited.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden also questioned my shorthand when I used the expression "visiting lawyer". He is quite right, of course. The mere fact that someone who is qualified in a foreign legal system is residing in London would not disqualify him from the provisions of this order. I cannot imagine that it would happen very often. Most people whose qualifications relate to foreign legal systems and who do not have a qualification in this country are probably exercising their talents abroad, because that is where they are most likely to earn their living.<br><br>
I take the point of the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve), that we have had, both in the solicitors' profession and at the Bar, a number of very distinguished foreign colleagues, whom we have all been very pleased to work with, who have a qualification in English law. It is certainly true, as the hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out, that in that respect, certainly England and I think the whole of the United Kingdom has been more liberal than some other European countries.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Southport asked me to say a little more about professional misconduct, and particularly why we have what appears to be legislation by reference, why article 15 refers to article 4 of the directive. This was a difficult question, and a great deal of thought was given to it. The point is that in this country, as no one will know better than the hon. and learned Gentleman, most of these rules are not matters of law. They are matters of professional discipline. We have deliberately, as a policy, left these matters to the profession to regulate, not always perhaps with the whole approval of some of our colleagues who are not members of the legal profession, but that is the way we have done it.<br><br>
It was felt that to try to introduce these rules as a matter of law would lead to almost impossible problems of drafting and, I think, would earn the resentment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0336">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
of the profession, which prefers to interpret these matters for itself. The way in which it has been done in this order is therefore to give the professional tribunals jurisdiction to interpret these matters.<br><br>
On legal aid, I certainly take the point of the hon. and learned Member for Solihull. Perhaps I was too cavalier in saying that there would not be many occasions when it would be required. The hon. and learned Gentleman has made a point which we should all bear in mind. I think we have all been perhaps assuming rather readily that these provisions will apply substantially to commercial law and will not affect the kinds of law which directly affect the daily lives of ordinary people. We may be wrong about that. Certainly in relation to family law I take the view that we are.<br><br>
I have tried to answer the questions that have been raised so far as possible within the confines of not delaying the Committee unduly. I do not think that I have left any questions substantially unanswered, but I echo again what the hon. and learned Member for Southport said. What we are discussing are the ways by which we can ensure that those who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
purport either to give legal advice or to appear before the courts in this country have the necessary expertise to do so, and I do not believe that the legal profession here has any other vested interest in the matter.<br><br>
In conclusion, Mr. English, may I express the appreciation of all members of the Committee for the way in which you have presided over our proceedings? For the record, I have obtained substantial benefit from the notes that you passed out from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I echo that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank all members of the Committee for being so reasonable. No one tried to filibuster in the debate. Otherwise, I should perhaps have drawn some of the remarks to order.</span></p>
