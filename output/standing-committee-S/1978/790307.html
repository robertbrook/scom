DRAFT EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES (DEFINITION OF TREATIES) (ECSC DECISION ON SUPPLEMENTARY REVENUES) ORDER 1979</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. John Tomlinson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (ECSC Decision on Supplementary Revenues) Order 1979.</p></blockquote>
The order specifies as a Community treaty the decision taken at the Council of Ministers on 30 October 1978 to allocate supplementary revenues to the 1978 budget for the European Coal and Steel Community.<br><br>
If, after consideration by this Committee, the House approves, the order will formally define the decision as a Community treaty under section 1 of the European Communities Act 1972. I believe the Committee is familiar with this procedure, which we have considered on a number of occasions in the past.<br><br>
The purpose of the Council decision specified in this order is to provide the European Coal and Steel Community with the additional revenue needed to make good a deficiency in its 1978 budget as a result of increased expenditure arising from the steel recession.<br><br>
As the Committee knows, the steel industry has been hit hard by a sharp fall in demand at a time when world steel production capacity has been greatly increased in anticipation of a high level of demand which failed to materialise. The steel industry has suffered accordingly.<br><br>
In human terms, the main brunt has fallen on the steel workers themselves, a distressing number of whom have been made redundant throughout the Community. The deficiency in the 1978 budget has arisen largely as a result of Community policies designed to soften the impact of the crisis on these men. As the Committee may know, they qualify
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
for resettlement aid. This takes the form of making up for a period the earnings of re-employed workers to the levels they received before they were made redundant, providing additional unemployment benefits and making grants towards retraining. The 1978 budget provides for an increase of 35 million units of account on expenditure in this area. The Committee will wish to know that Community reimbursement to the United Kingdom of aids for resettlement is expected to be £7·7 million in 1978 compared with £2·1 million in 1977.<br><br>
The Community not only provides resettlement aid, but, as the Committee knows, has agreed policies for encouraging the creation of alternative employment for redundant workers. Interest rebates, generally of 3 per cent, over 5 years, are given on ECSC loans for projects providing employment for redundant coal and steel workers. A recent example is the interest rebate given on an ECSC loan of £78 million towards the cost of the Ford motor company's projected new engine plant in South Wales. The 1978 budget increased expenditure in this area by 7·7 million units of account.<br><br>
In addition, interest rebates are available on ECSC loans for coal projects and aid for those steel projects which are considered to be of particular value in restructuring the industry. The Community's objective here is to bring the steel industry's capacity into line with the level of demand forecast in the 1980s and to improve its efficiency so that it can meet world competition. An increase of 12–5 million units of account is included in the 1978 budget under this heading.<br><br>
The total of expenditure provided for in this way in the ECSC operation budget amounts to 152 million units of account for 1978. That is some 38 million units of account more than for 1977. That figure takes account of the reduction from 18 million units of account to 5 million units of account in the ECSC's contribution to the general EEC budget towards the administrative expenses of the Commission.<br><br>
Given these plans for increased expenditure, the Community was faced with the problem of deciding how to raise the necessary funds. In view of the difficulties currently facing the steel industry, the Community decided against raising above
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0623">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
its existing level of 0·29 per cent, the production levy on the coal and steel industries by which Community expenditure is financed under the terms of articles 49 and 50 of the ECSC treaty. The Council agreed instead, in December 1977, to make up the anticipated 1978 deficit by means of exceptional contributions from member States totalling 32 million units of account—a figure which was subsequently reduced to 28 million units of account. In the event, the sum raised by the production levy increased as a result of a slight improvement in production levels in 1978. The Council subsequently agreed on the contributions that individual member States should make. The United Kingdom will contribute 17·4 per cent, compared with 21·3 per cent, contributed by France and 33·1 per cent, by Germany.<br><br>
I accordingly seek approval for the necessary Order in Council.</span></p>
<p>10.37 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had expected the Opposition spokesman to say a few words first as we are concerned with expenditure.<br><br>
By way of introduction, I suggest that this may be the first time that this procedure, which is well known to members of the Committee, has been used to vote money. I do not know whether that is true, though I suspect that it is. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will confirm that point. Even if this is not the first occasion, it is a mysterious and important one. The procedures surrounding the definition of treaty orders have been controversial in the past, and I suggest that this is a controversial use of a controversial procedure.<br><br>
The order states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Community Treaty as defined in section 1(2) of the European Communities Act 1972."</p></blockquote>
The explanatory memorandum, however, refers to section 1(3), which my memory tells me is correct. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that is so. I apologise, Mr. Wells, that I have not brought the European Communities Act with me, but I did not think that would be necessary. However, it would appear that there is either a mistake or a conflict on the official documents.<br><br>
It is well known that this procedure uses a domestic statutory instrument to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
define any Community treaty which is in draft and which has been sent to the House for ratification as a Community treaty. If the statutory instrument, which is an affirmative instrument, is approved, we are automatically tied to the terms of that treaty, whatever it may be. By definition, the material in that treaty is additional to the foundation treaties of the Community—namely, the Treaty of Rome, the ECSC treaty or the Euratom treaty—or it is using or taking powers not contained in those treaties. That is an important constitutional matter. The Treaty of Rome, in relation to the powers of the Assembly, was amended by this very procedure in 1975, and the House was not aware of what was taking place.<br><br>
I turn now to the detailed wording of the order. I have drawn attention to what may be an anomaly or an incorrect part in article 2. The face of the order does not tell us anything about v/hat it is doing. For that we have to turn to the schedule:
<br><blockquote><p>"Decision of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Coal and Steel Community, meeting within the Council, of 30 October 1978, allocating to that Community supplementary revenues for 1978 (Cmnd.)."</p></blockquote>
There is an awful lot in that and I wish to draw attention to at least three aspects. First, this is apparently a decision of representatives of member States. My hon. Friend mentioned a decision of 22 December, but the schedule refers to a meeting of representatives on 30 October 1978. It may be that what I understand is called COREPER met on 30 October. But, if it did, clearly that was before 22 December.<br><br>
Are we to understand that civil servants, important though they may be, are permitted to take an executive act on behalf of the Council of Ministers at the EEC? I can draw no other conclusion from the wording of the schedule. Perhaps my hon. Friend will say whether I am correct. If so, I suggest that the House should be informed of that fact as it is a matter of some constitutional significance.<br><br>
Secondly, "supplementary revenues" can cover a multitude of possibilities. It means that some moneys are to be voted to the ECSC over and above its existing authorisation to collect revenue. I guess that the ECSC's existing powers over
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0624">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
money are in the ECSC treaty, articles 49 and 50. Cmnd 4863 is a reprint of this treaty. The high authority is empowered to procure the funds that it requires to carry out its tasks by imposing levies on the production of coal and steel and by contracting loans and receiving gifts. I presume that article 49 is the only authority in existence so far for the ECSC to get its money. We are now being asked to provide more.<br><br>
I also presume that while, according to the memorandum, the amount is only £3·3 million—I say "only £3·3 million"; it is a little piece of paper which is a £3·3 million note—it could have been £30 million or £300 million. The procedure which we are debating this morning could have mentioned any sum. Indeed, the sum does not appear on the order at all.<br><br>
That brings me to the decision, which is in an unnamed, unprinted Command Paper. It has subsequently been published—Treaty Series No. 22 (1979) Cmnd. 7464. This is the decision which my hon. Friend mentioned in passing. Article 1 provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Member States shall pay."</p></blockquote>
In other words, it is thoroughly binding. Article 2 sets out the contributions to be made by member States. For the United Kingdom, it is 4,877,513 EUAs. Article 3 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The sums to be paid … shall be payable on 1 December 1978.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The payments may be made either in EUA or in national currencies at the EUA exchange rate on the day of payment."</p></blockquote>
Presumably, that is across the exchanges and will be debited to our balance of payments.<br><br>
Article 4 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Member States shall, in close co-operation with the Commission, take all necessary measures to ensure the application of the aforegoing provisions."</p></blockquote>
Article 5 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Member States shall take the provisions necessary to implement this Decision.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Done at Luxembourg, 30 October 1978. J. Ertl, The President."</p></blockquote>
If that was done at Luxembourg on 30 October 1978, why was not the Command paper printed at the time of printing of the statutory instrument, which could not have been before 1 January 1979? I submit that any ordinary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
citizen—for example, in Sheffield or in any place where people are particularly interested in steel—would not have a hope in hell of getting hold of the information available in this decision.<br><br>
The decision is not the only information that Members of Parliament have. We are privileged to have access to what is called an explanatory memorandum for the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, which is us. Here it is—printed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 3 January 1979. This document goes a great deal further than what purports to be the explanatory note, which is the last item on the order with which we are dealing.<br><br>
I will read the explanatory note, because it is worth putting on record. It starts:
<br><blockquote><p><i>"This Note is not part of the Order."</i></p></blockquote>
Then it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Order declares the Decision of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Coal and Steel Community, meeting within the Council, of 30 October 1978, allocating to that Community supplementary revenues for 1978 (Cmnd.) to be a Community Treaty as denned in section 1(2) of the European Communities Act 1972."</p></blockquote>
Any citizen interested in the EEC or steel affairs reading that note would really be none the wiser. I do not think that even my hon. Friend could suggest that people would be any the wiser from reading that note.<br><br>
My hon. Friend told us something about the money. But what it is for? The memorandum which Members of Parliament were given—if they asked for it —tells us a little about that aspect. It may be that other hon. Members will catch your eye, Mr. Wells, and talk about the application of the money. Incidentally, the memorandum states that the money will be paid by Parliament out of the Consolidated Fund.<br><br>
Although it gives something of the background, this cyclostyled explanatory memorandum does not tell us how the money is to be expended. It was not until my hon. Friend mentioned retraining and—rather curiously—something about the Ford works that we heard where some of the £3·3 million was to be spent.<br><br>
We have had trouble over the content of explanatory notes. We have had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0625">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
debates about this matter both in Committee and on the Floor of the House, and my hon. Friend or his right hon. Friends conceded a small point. They decided that they would at least state on these mysterious " Definition of Treaties" orders the subject of the orders. Therefore—and I am grateful to them—we see in brackets:
<br><blockquote><p>"ECSC Decisions on Supplementary Revenues".</p></blockquote>
The Government have gone that far but they have not gone very far on the explanatory note. Surely they could have stated that this was an additional treaty, arrived at by the Council of Ministers or their representatives, placing an additional charge upon the United Kingdom cf £3·3 million to cover excess expenditure, not authorised under the treaty, by the European Coal and Steel Community last year for retraining, grants or whatever it may be? I suggest that 10 lines might have been reasonable.<br><br>
I should like to ask my hon. Friend why that was not done, especially as the Government boast of open government. This has happened before. We have had debates about the unsatisfactory nature of explanatory notes. Indeed, in order to cover the deficiency, my hon. Friend has in the past said that an extra explanatory memorandum would be given to the Committee. When we ask why the information is not put in the explanatory note, we are told "There are difficulties because certain treaties can have direct legislative effect. We do not always know which parts of a treaty will have direct legislative effect. Therefore, in view of the understood convention that the explanatory note does not attempt to define the law, we cannot give such explanations in it."<br><br>
Is my hon. Friend really pretending that the parts of the explanatory note that I have suggested ought to be there in any way come under that heading? Although it may not be directly applicable in court, as it is confined only to Parliament, I should have thought that the whole of this treaty was directly applicable in terms of paying money. It is not optional. Therefore, the explanation that the explanatory note is venturing on to interpretation just will not do.<br><br>
We have only an hour and a half for this discussion—another lacuna in proce-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
dure about which the Select Committee on Procedure has some recommendations. Therefore, I shall not pursue these matters further. But it is clear to hon. Members that the procedure under the Act is curious and deficient. The procedure for dealing with a domestic statutory instrument is also defective, because those of us entitled to a vote here will not make any difference. The matter will be taken on the Floor of the House, perhaps late at night, for a decision forthwith. That is an unsatisfactory procedure, upon which the Select Committee on Procedure has commented.<br><br>
The statutory instrument may be defective in view of the points that I have raised. It is extremely curious that the representatives of the Government, rather than the Council of Ministers, have made the treaty. The dates between October and December are mysterious. The Command paper, which is the real nub of the decision, is not in the statutory instrument. No numbers were printed, although I should have thought there was plenty of time between October and January. Finally, the explanatory note is not an explanatory note.</span></p>
<p>10.51 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) has ably put forward arguments in which he has questioned the vires of the draft order and, to a great extent, the propriety of the form of procedure for putting the order before the House.<br><br>
I rise only because those are matters for consideration by the Joint Select Committee en Statutory Instruments, of which I have the honour to be chairman. As the Committee will know, the Joint Select Committee has reported to the House that it has considered the draft order. It has gone no further than that. Therefore, one must assume that the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments finds the instrument in order.<br><br>
Of course, it would not be in order to discuss the deliberations of a Select Committee, so the rest of my address to this Committee will consist entirely of my own views on the order.<br><br>
Some months ago an undertaking was given by Ministers in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that, because these draft orders defining treaties introduce certain new law, a memorandum setting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0626">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
out the Government's views on the new law introduced into our substantive law would be placed in the Vote Office. That was the point of an explanatory memorandum, in addition to that on the back of the order, being placed in the Vote Office for our use and information.<br><br>
The memorandum provided on this occasion did not specifically deal with the law introduced into the substantive law of the United Kingdom by the definition of this treaty. But if one referred to Cmnd. 7464, it was obvious how this treaty would affect the law of this country. It was not necessary for the Department to spell that out in its memorandum, because it was perfectly clear from the Cmnd. paper. However, it was unfortunate that the Cmnd. paper was not specified in the explanatory note.<br><br>
I understand that at the time when the draft order was printed and issued, that Cmnd. paper had not been printed. That was unfortunate. Over the past six to nine months there has been difficulty about the distribution of documents by Her Majesty's Stationery Office. However, that is another argument altogether.<br><br>
In fact, the Command Paper was in the Vote Office about a fortnight ago. Upon inquiry, I discovered how the blank should be filled. Anyone interested in this order could have made a similar inquiry and obtained the Command paper. That did not seem to be a defect in the order.<br><br>
Having got the Command paper and seen what it said, it did not seem to me that the Department needed to give any further explanation of how the treaty affected the law. I am not concerned about the merits of the treaty. The Department can put out what memorandum it likes about the merits of the treaty. I am concerned only with the form and procedure.<br><br>
The explanatory note seemed adequate in referring to the Command paper. But the hon. Member for Newham, South asked whether this so-called treaty could be defined as a treaty within the provisions of section 1 of the European Communities Act 1972 and could thereby introduce new law into the law of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The provisions of the European Communities Act dealing with treaties are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
very wide. I think that they can include in their wording something which we might not normally think of as a treaty. It has been the custom in the past to use the formula quoted by the hon. Member for Newham, South—namely:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Coal and Steel Community, meeting within the Council".</p></blockquote>
That formula has been adopted and accepted by Parliament as being sufficient description of a treaty within the European Communities Act 1972. In my view, therefore, this treaty can be the subject of a draft order of this kind.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newham, South was right to raise these points about the order. It is a peculiar order. I do not think that hitherto we have seen one merely voting money and calling an agreement to vote money a treaty. But I fear that is what we have let ourselves in for with this procedure of draft orders defining treaties under the European Communities Act 1972.</span></p>
<p>10.59 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Hooley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I want to reinforce what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) about the explanatory note. It is a disgraceful co-called explanation. I have read it carefully three or four times and am totally unable to understand its meaning. I cannot for the life of me understand why the actual figure of 4,877,000 units of account, which appears in the Command paper, could not have been mentioned as the amount we intended to approve. Indeed, it could have been converted into sterling so that the citizens of this country could understand it.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said that in this order we were "merely voting money". I thought that one of the fundamental constitutional prerogatives of the House of Commons was to control public expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to explain. I used the word loosely. I meant that the order seems only to be voting money and not doing the normal things which we expect in a treaty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hooley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the right hon. Gentleman's exegesis of his comment. It is startling, none the less. I agree that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0627">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
£3¼ million is a very tiny sum in the whole range of public expenditure. I am not a constitutional expert. Therefore, I do not know whether the House normally approves public expenditure by Orders in Council. I should have thought that it did not. I may be wrong. There may be Orders in Council relating to pensions, insurance and other matters which have the effect of authorising public expenditure, but I doubt it. The accrual of public expenditure by Orders in Council seems a strange and curious way of going about our business and requires investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is right, does my hon. Friend agree that the use of this statutory instrument would be defined as an unexpected use of the power?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hooley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is probably true. However, I want to make another point. According to our procedures, this instrument cannot be effective unless approved by both Houses. To the best of my knowledge, the House of Lords has no authority in matters of public expenditure. Therefore, it would be improper for this instrument to be laid before the House of Lords in the sense that it is authorising the expenditure of £3¼ million of public money. The legal and constitu-tionel authorities of the House should look at that matter very closely.<br><br>
As I understand it, the order seeks to authorise public expenditure to the tune of £3¼ million—not a large sum. The House of Lords has no say in such a matter as that under our constitutional procedures. If that is so, it seems that not only the instrument, but the procedure, is defective. Therefore, I suggest that matter should be looked into with great care.<br><br>
I come to the question of who took the decision as set out in Cmnd. 7464. According to the schedule, it was a decision of the
<br><blockquote><p>"Representatives of the Governments of the Member States".</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that the council of permanent representatives—in other words, the professional bureaucrats—or does it mean the Ministers? If it means the Ministers, one cannot seriously quarrel with it, because the Council of Ministers has power to do this sort of thing. But if it means civil servants—important and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
responsible people though they may be— it is quite improper that such a body should purport to take a decision committing the taxpayers of this country to such public expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may clear up this point. My understanding is that the meeting which took place on 30 October was a meeting of the Council. It was the Energy Ministers Council, not COREPER. If that proves to be other,, than 100 per cent, accurate I shall communicate with all members of the Committee, because it is important. My understanding is that the meeting on 30 October was a meeting of Ministers meeting in the framework of the Energy Ministers Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hooley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that statement, which I accept as being made in good faith. But I am still puzzled by the expression
<br><blockquote><p>"Representatives of the Governments … meeting within the Council".</p></blockquote>
I find that an odd expression. If it had said "Council of Ministers", one could understand it. I should be interested to know the meaning of
<br><blockquote><p>"Representatives of the Governments … meeting within the Council".</p></blockquote>
I accept my hon. Friend's kind offer to explain this important point and I accept what he has said in good faith.<br><br>
I come to the actual substance of the £3¼ million. This is an interesting matter.<br><br>
I secured from the Library a document put out by Brussels dated December 1977. It refers to the operational budget of the European Coal and Steel Community and gives a rough outline of the 1977 and 1978 budgets.<br><br>
On the expenditure side, administration in 1977 was to be 18 million units of account, as my hon. Friend mentioned in his opening speech. Payments under article 56, which is largely a question of resettlement and redundancy payments, training and help for workers, was to be 38·3 million EUA; contributions to investment, 8·5 million EUA; contributions to research, 38·4 million EUA; and some general help to coke, coal and other fuels,
II million EUA—a total of 114 million EUA.<br><br>
On the income side for 1977, the bulk of the income was 81–5 million EUA. All
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0628">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
figures are in units of account. I am sorry not to translate them into sterling. One has to divide by two-thirds. The levy was to' produce 81·5 million EUA. Certain interest payments represented 16 million EUA. There is rather an odd special contribution from customs duties, which I do not understand. However, the bulk of the income in 1977 amounted to 97·5 million, which certainly covered the major part of the expenditure proposed in that budget. One could not have much serious quarrel with that, although I am puzzled by the 10 million EUA from customs duties which do not seem to be provided for in the treaty.<br><br>
In the 1978 budget we have a totally different picture. First, administration is cut from 18 million EUA to 5 million EUA. One might hope that was a brilliant piece of saving on bureaucracy. But not at all. It is simply a fiddling of the accounts by switching certain charges from the coal and steel budget to the general budget of the Community.<br><br>
The Brussels document is interesting on this point. The first paragraph states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Based on the ECSC Treaty, this budget is distinct from the Community's General Budget, and is adopted in accordance witn a different budgetary procedure."</p></blockquote>
That is fair enough, but the next paragraph states:
<br><blockquote><p>"ECSC administrative expenditure is cut from 18 million to 5 million EUA, the difference being absorbed in the Community's General Budget."</p></blockquote>
In one phrase it says that these are two totally different accounting exercises and in the next it switches 13 million EUA of expenditure from one to the other, presumably to produce for itself some extra revenue for its own purposes. I should be interested to know whether this kind of fiddling administrative switch is in accordance with the treaties. The Brussels document certainly suggests that it is not. It says that it
<br><blockquote><p>"is adopted in accordance with a different budgetary procedure".</p></blockquote>
But in the next paragraph we are told that if the odd 13 million EUA are required —that is about £9 million—switches can be made and no one will make any fuss about it. I think that matter needs to be looked at.<br><br>
The major difference on which my hon. Friend touched concerned expenditure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
under article 56 of the treaty. It shoots up from 38·3 million EUA in 1977 to 85 million EUA in 1978. It more than doubles in one year. If that doubling remained within the proper resources of the European Coal and Steel Community, one need not quarrel with it. If the levy produced sufficient funds to pay for all the extra expenditure, it would be within the general terms of reference of the treaty. But clearly it does not. The result of that massive jump, which apparently the high authority wants to spend, is that it is now coming to the member Governments—the taxpayers—for special contributions for that purpose. That is the purpose of the order.<br><br>
I submit that it is not proper for the European Coal and Steel Community to demand special tax payments into its budget because of its own pet schemes. Those schemes may be inherently reasonable. They are intended to pay to member Governments sums for resettlement, retraining and so forth of redundant workers.<br><br>
We have massive schemes for the redeployment of workers and redundancy payments for the modernisation of our steel industry. The British Steel Corporation is carrying through a far-reaching and painful process of restructuring involving hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money. But it is not clear to me why it is in any way significant or necessary to start channelling funds of this kind through the ECSC. I do not understand why the ECSC cannot be content with its own approved resources— the 0·29 per cent, plus on items from elsewhere—and confine itself to expenditure within those proper resources instead of suddenly demanding a special payment of an extra 32 million EUA—approximately £20 million—not provided for in the European Coal and Steel Community treaty, which involves us in stumping up £3£ million.<br><br>
I want to know what will face us in 1979. The explanatory memorandum is very cagey about this matter. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission have made proposals for meeting the expected Budget deficiency for 1979. These are under discussion within the Council framework."</p></blockquote>
What sort of sums will it come up with next time? Will it say that it will want an extra 100 million EUA from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0629">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
member States over and above the regular income of the Community? If so, will this House be told that, provided that we have an Order in Council which specifies this as a treaty, the taxpayer can stump up and that is the end of the matter?<br><br>
If we adopt that kind of procedure, the House will be in danger of losing effective control of the financial arrangements of the ECSC. It should look very carefully at any order, which, in effect, is a vote of public expenditure.<br><br>
I hope that this debate will be taken very seriously into account by the authorities of the House and by the Government, so that we can examine more closely how the budgeting, expenditure and income of this body can be more closely scrutinised and effectively controlled.</span></p>
<p>11.13 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had some useful comments this morning. I was particularly interested to hear the views put forward by the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Hooley). In the procedural sense, we have some problems and some reservations about the way in which we are working. I should like to turn to that in a moment.<br><br>
First, I should like to touch on what seems to me to be the relevant background to the order that is before us today. If I understood the Minister this morning, it is fair to say that he was referring to a tidying up operation and was urging us to balance the 1978 budget. On that score, the bulk of my remarks will relate to steel, because that is the principal problem with which this country is concerned within the ECSC budget.<br><br>
The most useful evidence that I have been able to attract on this subject is from the British Steel Corporation, which makes the point that until last year the Commission was able to balance its budget. That arose from the basic fact that the projected income from the coal and steel levy, and, to a small extent, the interest obtained from revenues set aside in earlier years, matched the outlay on research grants, the Commission's half of the loan share of readaptation payments to work people and so on. There is a whole range of current payments which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
we know about of which the House is in favour.<br><br>
But, in a time of deepening crisis in the steel industry, I understand that there has been a two-way squeeze on the ECSC budget. On the one hand, there has been expenditure on the readaptation grants, and the planned increase in loan interest subsidies has gone up substantially as we have had accelerated closure programmes.<br><br>
On the other hand—this is the point that the British Steel Corporation makes very clearly—the Commission has felt unable to increase revenues from the companies, including BSC, because of the cash bond in which they find themselves. That is a natural reticence that the British Steel Corporation has supported.<br><br>
If that is the general background—if that is the situation which led the Commission to seek member Governments in Council on 30 October to balance the books, as it were—as far as I can see— and I take the point made by the hon. Member for Newham, South on this matter—we are involved in a procedure which does not seem to be at all clearly defined within the treaty.<br><br>
Incidentally, I noted that the hon. Member for Newham, South referred to the treaty published under Cmnd 4863. My admiration for his vigilance is such that I know he will take it in the spirit in which it is intended. There is a later edition of that treaty. I am not sure whether the version which he quoted was the same as that from which I intend to quote. In Cmnd 5189, which is the latest copy of the European Coal and Steel Community, article 50, paragraph 2, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The mode of assessment and collection shall be determined by a general decision of the High Authority taken after consulting the Council; cumulative imposition shall be avoided as far as possible."</p></blockquote>
That seems very broad. The procedure which has emerged—and we are all grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby for giving us the view of the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments on this matter—seems to be a kind of "ad hockery". I very much hope that the Committee will do some valuable work in urging reconsideration of the procedural aspects by which this budget is to be determined.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0630">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
But it is not only the budget which we are tidying up for this year. Discussions are far advanced, as the hon. Member for Heeley implied, for the 1979 budget. The Committee is perfectly entitled to consider not only the principles upon which we make this retrospective payment, but its impact upon future calculations for 1979 payments and beyond.<br><br>
On that score my understanding from the British Steel Corporation is that the budget deficit is likely to be the same in 1979 as in 1978. Therefore, it would seem that quite soon the same problem will arise. I join hon. Members who have implied that the procedure needs to be looked at very carefully and that a better procedure must be found.<br><br>
I wish to pursue the matter of procedure a little further before turning to the question that I specifically want to put to the Minister—namely, the balance of advantage to Britain regarding payments which have already been made. We have not so far touched upon that subject, but it is crucial in deciding whether public expenditure should be agreed at this stage.<br><br>
We have many difficulties in reaching a clear view on procedure. The Minister mentioned that the energy Ministers had met and discussed this matter. That seemed to imply that they covered the coal aspect. I appreciate the undertaking that the Minister gave to the Committee, but is it clear that there is agreement from the Department of Industry on this matter? I maintain that steel is of more direct concern in financial terms within the budget than coal. However, looking at the first six months of 1978, it is interesting to see that almost all the loans made to the coal industry in Europe came to the United Kingdom. Therefore, we have a substantial stake at present.<br><br>
I turn now to the situation m 1978 and its relationship to 1979. First, may we take it that the 28 million EUA will, as near as possible, balance the books? Will there be any overspill or plus coming out of that situation? To what extent will that carry over into 1979? Is there any possibility of seeing a reduced additional surcharge in 1979? As the third largest contributor to the fund, this is an essential matter for us to look at in detail.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
Is the deficit in 1979 likely to be comparable to that in 1978? If so, to what extent would it be offset by any plus balance in the current year?<br><br>
Is the only agreement to date of 32 million EUA for 1979 on an ad hoc basis? I understand that there is at present an ad hoc a.greement in principle that 32 million EUA is to be found in 1979 in addition to the normal revenues.<br><br>
What view do the Government take of the method of funding? I understand that the provision towards which we are now moving is based on GDP, whereas —this reinforces the point made by the hon. Member for Newhajm, South—the treaty refers to assessments being raised on various products according to their average value. There appears to be some discrepancy there which may have been agreed within the Council of Ministers but which, so far as I am aware, has not been aired in the House.<br><br>
Is the Minister able to confirm that the Commission's proposal for the steel customs duty payable scheme has not so far found agreement within the Council of Ministers? I am prepared to keep an open mind on this matter. Hon. Members will recall the debate on it earlier in the Session. It seems that, under article 71, the argument about greater flexibility being given to member countries to retain their own customs duties has proved attractive to most countries represented in the Council of Ministers. However, we would like to hear from the Minister precisely where we stand on that argument. As I said, we understand that the amounts to be raised today are related to GDP. Therefore, we assume that the current thinking is that, if additional funds are required in 1979, the same principle would need to apply.<br><br>
I turn now to the basic arguments about the value which we are or are not to obtain in return not only for this payment but, as the Minister made clear, for a total of £7·7 million in 1978. I am glad to have a chance to discuss these matters this morning because in our debate on 25 January, when we looked at the various Commission documents relevant to these areas, we found ourselves at cross purposes to some extent when the Under-Secretary of State for Industry gave a set of figures which implied a deficit balance to the United Kingdom for its payments, particularly within the steel industry.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0631">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
I should like to rehearse what seems to me to be the balance of payments for 1978, taking the steel amounts only as I know them best. If, as the Minister said in opening, £7·7 million was the total United Kingdom expenditure for the budget in 1978, against that we can clearly see a number of items. For example, the readaptation grants were £1·8 million. Another £500,000 was provided for cheap loan housing for those who had to move as a result of closures. We know that affected at least 2,400 workers in Hartlepool, Shotton, East Moors and so on. To that we must add £750,000 for research grants and £250,000 in low-interest subsidy for investment with an anti-pollution element. That gives us a pay-back of about £3¼ million.<br><br>
On top of that, however, as the Minister pointed out, there is the further advantage of the interest rebate of 3 per cent, over five years. He may have a sum which can show us what that has been worth to us over the year in question. In addition, there is the loan interest on the £412 million of direct ECSC loans and the £216 million from the European Investment Bank. Quite apart from that, there is the AAA rating which the Commission is able to obtain by putting out floating loans on the American market. The British Steel Corporation, for example, is getting a considerable advantage in ECSC commercial loans on specific investments, because it is able to get the money at lower than the national loan fund rate. Therefore, there are substantial amounts which, in my view, far and away exceed the present level of budget contribution, even taking into account this extra demand for £3·3 million.<br><br>
I should also like to refer to the views of the British Independent Steel Producers Association, which makes a particularly interesting and new point since we discussed these matters on 25 January. The Association points out that the European Coal and Steel Community budget cannot be divorced from the Davignon proposals. In a letter of 16 February the Association says:
<br><blockquote><p>"the effect of Davignon's measures on the market have helped us more than anybody else, since we have by their aid been able to maintain a market price level for a wide range of middle-grade products, some £25 a tonne above the Continental level—covering
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
about 2 million tonnes a year shared about 50/50 BSC/BISPA."</p></blockquote>
I know that the hon. Member for Heeley will be particularly interested in that statement. Although it refers to the middle range of products extending into alloy— not the special end with which the hon. Gentleman has been particularly concerned—it shows that on £50 million of sales there is direct evidence of the advantage of the agreement which has come through Davignon and for which the ECSC budget provides an integral subscription fee.<br><br>
The letter goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has also moderated the flow of imports from EEC into UK, and thus given us relief from some of the large-scale lay-offs endured on the Continent for purely market (as distinct from efficiency) reasons."</p></blockquote>
Taking those factors into account, I am bound to say that the amounts that we are considering this morning are justified by the benefits to this country. Finally, I should like to cite two remarks from BISPA's annual report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hooley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Davignon plan relates to imports and pricing which are not affected by contributions from the budget. The hon. Gentleman said that we were paying a subscription. We are, of course, paying a subscription through the levy. What we are discussing is a surcharge. The subscription is the 0–29 per cent. This is a special surcharge. It is described in the budget as a special payment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. But the fact is that, within the surcharge, we are paying for the administration costs, which include the cost of Davignon. The hon. Gentleman made a very interesting point in asking whether the organisation and administration costs had in some way been subsumed elsewhere. I should go along with him in trying to pin that down more precisely. But, with his experience, the hon. Gentleman must know that trying to monitor imports and pricing is vastly complex and must be one of the most expensive parts of administration. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the very substantial advantages which we are getting at' present.<br><br>
Having said that, I look to the day when what has to be a temporary arrangement can be disbanded in favour of a rational European steel industry. We are,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0632">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
however, some years away from that day. In its annual report, QISPA put forward the view that this arrangement had
<br><blockquote><p>"enabled European steel to co-operate in avoiding the widespread bankruptcies and mass unemployment of the ' Thirties' slump, in a crisis which is proving longer and perhaps more grave".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that the arrangement is
<br><blockquote><p>"providing an essential breathing space while European steel recasts its 'structure' to fit a world steel picture with major new competitors and permanent loss of traditional export markets".</p></blockquote>
That is the background against which we should look at the whole European Coal and Steel Community budget and the supplement which is before us today.<br><br>
In conclusion, I would ask the Minister whether he can tell us anything more about the basis upon which discussions are to proceed now for 1979. A timetable showing when these matters will be discussed and, indeed, when the House will have an opportunity to consider them in more detail would be very helpful. I join hon. Members on both sides who have said that the procedures within which we appear to be working here on a rather ad hoc basis are open to question and need urgent review.</span></p>
<p>11.29 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Stoddart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for very long. I must say that, when I saw my name on the Committee list, I thought it an infernal nuisance as I had other engagements this morning. Nevertheless, to please the Whips, I decided to come along this morning and make my presence, if not my voice, felt.<br><br>
Having listened to the debate, I felt that I had to say a few words as I find this instrument appallingly disturbing. I must confess that, as I had not expected to speak, I had not taken much note of the statutory instrument. It is fortunate that there are members present—my hon. Friends the Members for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) and Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Hooley)—who pay a lot of attention to these instruments. They have shown that certain precedents could be set here which could have implications for Parliament which it would not accept.<br><br>
I am particularly concerned and disturbed to hear from my hon. Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Member for Heeley that the other place will have to pass this statutory instrument, and that, willy-nilly, we shall be giving it powers which it does not and ought not to possess. We are apparently creating a precedent because the voting of money will now be subject to the consent of the other place. I sincerely hope that my hon. Friend will take this matter into consideration and, on that basis alone, will agree to withdraw the order to give the House time to consider its constitutional implications.<br><br>
I am also concerned that the draft statutory instrument appears to seek not to inform, but to conceal. That is no way for the Government to treat Parliament, and Parliament should not allow Government to treat it in that way. I agree with other hon. Members who have spoken about this concealment and urged the Government to bs open, straightforward and informative with the House. If they are not—if they continue to attempt to conceal information or try to ensure that information is not easily available and does not accompany the main document—Parliament will eventually turn on them and perhaps restrict their powers in a way they may not like.<br><br>
We are talking about a figure of £3·25 million. That might not seem a lot of money—indeed, some might describe it as peanuts—but it can make a lot of difference to various programmes in this country. For example, £3·25 million would make a hell of a difference to the Kirkby co-operative. It could make the difference between remaining open or being closed. I am sure that the Falmouth shipyard workers would welcome the injection of £3·25 million into their workplace, because that amount would give them a few extra months of breathing space. So £3·25 million could be very significant and we should not describe such an amount as peanuts. In any event, even that sum of money ought not to be voted through in the way being attempted this morning.<br><br>
Is it right that we should have a special levy? Is it right that we should finance the budget in this way? I believe it is provided for, but is it the correct way to finance payments to displaced workers? I do not think it is right. There is provision within the treaty for the normal levy of 0·29 per cent, to finance the budget of the European Coal and Steel
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0633">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Community. Why should we want top-ping-up finance? Would not the fairest way be to increase the basic levy? My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State shakes his head. Perhaps he will explain why not. I shall try to explain why it would be fairer.<br><br>
The basic levy is based on production. Therefore, those who produce most and are in the best economic position pay most. In those circumstances, I should have thought that an increase in the levy would have borne less hardly on those least able to pay and most hardly on those best able to pay. That is a good Socialist principle and one which should achieve the ends wanted by the Community without having to bring special measures before this Committee and Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not recognise that his argument, though fair, simply means that the British Steel Corporation will in principle, arrive in fund and then come back to the taxpayer at a time of heavy loss-making? It is a question whether one shares the loss or puts it all on to the BSC for the taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stoddart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but in relation to the BSC there are other factors to be taken into account. My basic premise is correct. As the Community already has a method of raising additional finance, I do not see why the House should be asked to vote money over and above the existing powers. I hope that my hon. Friend will consider what has been said and, bearing in mind the constitutional implications of the order, will agree to take it back this morning.</span></p>
<p>11.39 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee very long. I begin by apologising for having missed the beginning of the debate due to another commitment.<br><br>
If, as seems to me inescapable, the British Steel industry is to be given a measure of temporary protection against growing competition from Third world countries, that can only be done within the context of the ECSC. However, I should hope that it would be a provisional
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
and temporary expedient. But, even on that short term basis, such an operation is inconceivable on a purely national scale. It follows that the Davignon plan has to be made to operate in order to provide for an orderly adaptation of the British Steel industry within a European context. If the Davignon plan is to operate, those who will the end must will the means. Therefore, it is futile to complain if the cost of this essential operation falls upon the United Kingdom in one form or another. I do not wish to go into the proper method of financing the deficit. I do not want to go into the argument between the levy and the special contribution. I merely wish to make the point that those who will the end must will the means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hooley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made the astonishing statement that we must protect ourselves against Third world countries. The threat to the British steel industry, certainly in Sheffield, comes from Germany, France and Italy and, in a wider context, from Japan. It does not come from Third world countries at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir A. Meyer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should have said Third world countries, plus Japan. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that in the long term the threat to the British steel industry comes not even primarily from Japan, but from countries such as Korea and Brazil, which are rapidly coming on stream as major producers of steel.<br><br>
I agree that the steel interests which the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Hooley) so ably represents are in a position to withstand the competition much longer than those involved in bulk steel-making. None the less, the day for them will come, too. It seems that it is none too soon to start thinking in terms of how we are to adapt the British steel industry at all levels of sophistication to meet this very rapidly changing world situation in the steel market. It is very short-sighted to talk about the competition being only from Europe: on the contrary, it is only within the European Coal and Steel Community context that we can hope to preserve any number of worthwhile jobs within the British Steel industry.</span></p>

<p>11.41 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I say that this has been a useful and businesslike debate, I say it today with more conviction than perhaps I sometimes do. So many specific questions have been asked of me that I may in this reply omit to answer them all. I promise unequivocally that I will scrutinise <i>Hansard</i> with unusual avidity to make sure that every question of detail is answered. However, I hope to answer as many as possible now.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for New-ham, South (Mr. Spearing) thought that this was the first time that this procedure of authorising the spending of money had been used. My belief and recollection is that section 1(3) orders have been used to authorise payments before, but I shall have to verify the detail and I shall write to my hon. Friend on that point.<br><br>
I shall now deal with the many fundamental and important points which my hon. Friend raised. First, he mentioned the meeting on 30 October. I reaffirm that the meeting was of the Council of Energy Ministers. The decision was not taken by COREPER; in principle it was taken bv Ministers as far back as December 1977.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister also confirm whether the Department of Industry is fully in accord with the views put forward, presumably on its behalf, by the Energy Ministers from this country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to come to that as a separate question, but as the hon. Member has raised it now it will come as no surprise to him to know that different Departments of this Administration are in happy accord with each other when taking action inside the European Economic Community, as, of course, when taking action anywhere else.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for New-ham, South raised the question of the anomalies in different parts of the document and made various references to section 1(3) and section 1(2). He thought that there might be either error or contraction. The powers to specify new Community treaties are in section 1(3) of the European Communities Act. The reference to section 1(2) of the Act arises because the words "Community treaty" are themselves denned in section 1(2).
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
Article 2 of the order refers to section 1(2) because it is there that the definition of the words "Community treaty" is given.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for New-ham, South asked a detailed question about the draft order in Council not containing the Command paper reference number for the ECSC decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is hardly a detailed question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should have said, that my hon. Friend raised in some detail that important question. The printing of the Order in Council and of the Command paper containing the text of the ECSC decision allocating supplementary revenues for 1978 were not carried out simultaneously. Her Majesty's Stationery Office had not allocated a Command number to the ECSC decision when the Order in Council was committed for final printing, but when the order was laid in Parliament on 31 January 1979 the Government deposited the text of the ECSC decision in the Vote Office and also with the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. In this respect I am grateful for the intervention of the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), who made the point clear during his speech.<br><br>
If the implication of what my hon. Friend said was that here was an example of the Government seeking to introduce legislation by stealth—my hon. Friend the Member for Swindon (Mr. Stoddart) spoke about concealment by the Government—that was not the intention. The House can be in no doubt about the nature of the order and the treaty which it specifies from the information contained in the title of the order and in the supplementary information supplied to the House by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stoddart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday I went to the Vote Office and asked whether it could identify the associated documents. That proved difficult and the Vote Office was not able to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a direct matter for me, but I share my hon. Friend's regret that that was the case. The right hon. Member for Crosby said that he went to the Vote Office earlier and he did not suffer the same disability in being able to get the documents. However, that is a matter which my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0635">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
Friend will have to take up with the appropriate authorities of the House. The documents were in the Vote Office, and I believe that those documents in combination gave the information in sufficient detail for hon. Members to accept what I said earlier.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for New-ham, South and Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Hooley) raised the uestion of lack of information in the explanatory Note at the end of the section 1(3) orders. I sympathise with them and with any other hon. Members in this problem, which we have considered on a number of occasions. Any expansion of the notes would have to be compatible with the guidance issued by the statutory publications office to all Departments. This requires supplementary notes to be kept as short as is consistent with clarity and completeness.<br><br>
I accept that the words "clarity and completeness" are subjective and will mean different things to different people. But the Government are investigating whether improvements can be made as a result of the recommendations contained in the report of the Select Committee on Procedure. Hon. Members will appreciate that in this respect I can make no promises other than to say that that investigation, with a view to improvement, is taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that the point raised in previous debates concerning direct applicability or the risk thereof does not apply in this instance, and that the only qualification was one of clarity and completeness, which he has just quoted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend will forgive me if I do not try to cast my mind back and confirm or deny my agreement of something that happened in the past. The degree to which he follows these arguments is close, and I should look at his question before responding to it. The argument has gone on for such a long period that I should want to see the detail of what my hon. Friend is referring to before agreeing with him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hooley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister use his influence to make the clarity and completeness criteria take precedence over shortness in future?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take note of what my hon. Friend says. I am always in favour of clarity and completeness.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Crosby raised two specific matters. Having said to him in general terms that I was grateful for the comments he made, many of which I agreed with, I have to tell him that there are no provisions directly applicable in United Kingdom courts. This is spelled out clearly in the memorandum, in paragraph 4, under the heading "Reason for Specification". The reason mentioned is the need for amounts to be paid from the Consolidated Fund under section 2(3) of the European Communities Act, and there are no provisions for direct applicability.<br><br>
The answer to the other question raised by the right hon. Member is that the decision is a treaty. It is ECSC practice to call all its agreements "decisions", and there are many precedents for specifying ECSC decisions as Community treaties.<br><br>
I turn to the queries raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Heeley. Section 2(3) of the European Communities Act makes provision for expenditure in pursuance of Community obligations. What the order does is to declare that the treaty imposes a new Community obligation. Section 2(3) gives the statutory power to meet these international obligations.<br><br>
My hon. Friend also raised with some force the question: why did we use the formula "representatives of government" rather than saying "the Council of Ministers"? The formula "representatives of government" is used because this is a treaty which is embodied by representatives of Government. The document itself is not a decision within the existing powers of the Council of the ECSC.<br><br>
Both my hon. Friend the Member for Heeley and the hon. Member for Arundel (Mr. Marshall) raised a question about what is likely to happen during 1979. The position is that a further ad hoc contribution for 1979 has been agreed, subject to parliamentary approval, for the same total sum as the one now before us. The proposal is that this shall be shared among member States in accordance with the same key as has been discussed for the present order. It will be brought before the House in due
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
course. For future years, if budget expenditure has to remain at a high level and an increase in the levy remains undesirable, there will be a deficit which will have to be met in some way. The method of meeting it is still under discussion, and the United Kingdom remains unconvinced of the need to grant a permanent source of income to the Commission. Any proposals will need to be considered.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Arundel, in considering this question, looked at some of the alternatives and asked specifically why member States' contributions were not based on gross domestic product. There was some discussion of this method of computing each country's share, but no agreement was reached. It was felt by certain States that they would bear a disproportionate share of the cost and that there was no relationship between a State's gross national product and the size of its coal and steel industry. So there was no agreement in that area either. As I said earlier, the same total sum is to be raised for 1979 in accordance with the same method of distribution.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Swindon asked a number of questions. I have tried to deal with the first allegation that he made, that we seek to conceal. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth than that this Government are trying to withhold or conceal information from him, from Parliament or from any other person who seeks detailed knowledge of what is going on.<br><br>
My hon. Friend spent some time in talking about the £3·25.million, and I agree with him that that is not an insignificant figure to be described as peanuts. He gave us a number of examples of alternatives where that kind of figure could make a significant contribution. But when he is looking at alternative ways of spending it, so that it would have a significant effect, he should not overlook the fact that it is being used for a significant purpose. That purpose is bringing benefit to a number of parts of the United Kingdom which are benefiting from the work being done by the Coal and Steel Community.<br><br>
The more wide-ranging question that my hon. Friend raised, which was also asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South, was whether we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
were giving the House of Lords new constitutional powers which it does not have at the moment and which it ought not to have. The House of Lords does not have positive power to provide money. In their dealing with this order, their Lordships have only a negative power to refuse consent to our giving effect to a treaty obligation. I do not think that has quite the same significance as my hon. Friend would give it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stoddart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Kings have been brought down because of the refusal implied here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tomlinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to say, as I was half way through the sentence, that it does not have quite the same significance. I accept that there is a significance which the authorities of the House will need to look at, but I do not believe that in this process we are engaged in anything unique or novel.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Arundel asked whether I could give him some detailed indication of the balance between receipts from and payments to the ECSC budget. Some of his other questions I have dealt with in the course of my wider remarks.<br><br>
From the 1978 budget, the United Kingdom was allocated aid for resettlement grants totalling some £12·37 million, £7·7 million for the steel industry and £4·67 million for the coal industry. Interest rebates of £4·7 million were also granted on loans for projects designed to create new employment opportunities for redundanct coal and steel workers.<br><br>
These are allocations and not receipts. This is one of the difficulties that hon. Members have had in reconciling some of the figures used and some of the figures that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Industry was using during the debate on 25 January, I would have said something about the differences between the two, had the hon. Member wished, but time will not permit that.<br><br>
United Kingdom industries also benefit from the research budget for the European Coal and Steel Community, to the tune of £27 million in 1978. As a result of sponsored research through the Community, such sums are made available to all member States. The latest figures for 1978 showed that £4·78 million were spent on research here in the United Kingdom. Of course, the overall European anti-crisis measures for steel, referred to by the hon. Member for Flint, West
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
(Sir A. Meyer), have greatly helped British producers, and one industry estimate calculated that the British Steel Corporation's loss might have been 50 per cent, higher had these measures not been in operation.<br><br>
Our payments to the budget are £18·3 million, to which the levy from the industries contributes £15 million and the supplementary contribution £3·3 million. On balance, we can see from these figures that there is direct advantage to the United Kingdom from the present arrangements.<br><br>
This has been a useful debate. It has been businesslike. It has touched upon many of the procedural problems which yet remain to be resolved. The order before us is of benefit, and I hope it will be approved.<br><br>
My thanks to you, Mr. Wells, and to everybody concerned for the efficient way in which we have managed to com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
bine all our deliberations into the 90 minutes allocated to us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I quickly second what the Minister said, Mr. Wells, regarding your amiable chairmanship this morning? The Minister has still left a number of questions unanswered which we hope he will answer when we return to the House on these matters. In particular, the whole procedural way in which this matter is being dealt with on a post hoc basis needs looking at. I hope we can come back to it, but we do not have a mind to oppose the order today.</span></p>
