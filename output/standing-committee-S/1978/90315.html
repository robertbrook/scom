	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. Ronald King Murray)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Land Registration (Scotland) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>] in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
The Bill provides for the setting up of a Land Register of Scotland, on which will be recorded all land transactions as they take place. The new register will thus progressively supersede the existing register of sasines in which titles to land are presently recorded. The main provisions implement proposals in the report of the Henry Committee on Registration of Title to Land in Scotland, which was published in 1969.—Cmnd. 4137.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The register of sasines has existed in Scotland as a public register of title to land since 1617. This was one of the first land registers in the world, and was public from the outset. It has stood up to the test of time remarkably well. But, depending as it does on an examination by solicitors of the whole series of title deeds on each occasion on which a property changes hands in order to ensure that the transferee obtains a valid title, it has plainly become far too cumbersome a system to continue to cope with the pace and scope of modern property transactions. It could be kept alive only by the deployment of steadily increasing numbers of staff in the department of the registers, as well as in the private firms of professional searchers. Even as matters stand, delays in obtaining a completed title can frequently be lengthy, and in the longer term could only worsen if other measures were not set in train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic features of the new system of registration for which the Bill provides are twofold. First, when an application for registration is made for the first time, the Keeper of the Registers will carry out a thorough and once-for-all examination of all previous title deeds to the property. Further examination of a title, once registered, will thus be rendered unnecessary on any future occasion on which the property changes hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
Second, a title once entered on the land register will be guaranteed by the Keeper and any title holder will be indemnified against loss arising from any error in the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system of guaranteed title by registration, once in operation, will thus eliminate the present lengthy examination of titles. The system of public indemnity already applies in England and Wales in relation to the land registry system already partly in operation there. On the basis of experience in England and Wales, the number of occasions on which, as a result of error in the registers, this indemnity likely to be called upon is likely to be very small indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Craigen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that home buyers in Scotland can in future look forward to reduced conveyancing costs because the State will be incurring many of the risks involved in undertaking the indemnity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that in the long term the Bill does present a reasonable prospect of that. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] I put the matter rather guardedly, because hon. Members will appreciate that at the beginning the two registers will be running in parallel. I can make that answer to my hon. Friend more specific by saying that, once properties have been transferred from the register of sasines to the new register, there is every prospect that conveyancing fees will be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major change in machinery of the kind for which the Bill provides cannot be brought into force throughout Scotland overnight and will require to be phased over a period of years. Additional areas will be brought within the scope of the new register year by year until all nine areas into which the country is administratively divided for land registration purposes are embraced within it. It will, of course, be many years—perhaps 25 to 30—before every single property recorded in the present register of sasines is transferred to the new register and the sasines register can formally be wound up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donal Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press my right hon. and learned Friend on this matter? Obviously, there will be a long transition period. For example, in years one and two we start in Renfrew and Glasgow, but the unfortunate northern and agricultural areas do not get
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
the reform until year nine. That means that for a long period there will be two totally different conveyancing systems running, implying different amounts of work for the legal profession and, therefore, different scales of fees. Is that the situation my right hon. and learned Friend envisages, or will an effort be made to have a uniform conveyancing fee structure during the transition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has put an extremely pertinent question, which I should not wish to answer off the cuff, but I envisage that the problems he anticipates in the first part of his question will arise and I expect that the legal profession will work towards a solution of the type he suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I say a few words about the main contents of the Bill. Part I provides for the setting up of the new land register and contains detailed provisions governing the processes of registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 sets up the new public register and provides for its control and management by the Keeper of the Registers for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 describes the land transactions to be registered and provides, subject to certain exceptions, that registration shall be the only means of creating a real right in land. That is, in a way, the principle which underpins the Bill—the concept of title by registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 specifies the supporting information required with any application for registration, the main feature being the requirement as to the description of the land in question. In future, this will have to be in a form sufficient to enable the Keeper to identify it by reference to Ordnance Survey maps. The eventual certificate of title issued by the Keeper will be supported with an appropriate map section on which the boundaries of the property in question are delineated. I pause to say that that should be a great advantage to the consumer—those who buy and sell land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kinross and West Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could understand that if everybody always bought the same bit of land in the same quantity, but if land is broken up and some bits are added to other bits, how will the register keep track
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
of things which change their form like an amoeba?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has asked a question that needs an answer, but I do not think that it is a difficult question because the maps will be kept up to date. I should not expect any special problem arising from that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to trouble my right hon. and learned Friend again with technical questions. What would happen if there were a large villa in a town, the title to that villa being registered, and shortly after it was subdivided so that there would be questions of common access, division of the property, outhouses, garages and so on? Would it be written on to the land register, or should we need something equivalent to a deed of conditions which would have to be consulted to see what would be the rights of whoever bought part of that villa?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks a question which is a little too specific for me to answer off the cuff. I may be able to give him an answer later in this morning's proceedings. If not, I shall write to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the point my hon. Friend makes is important. Unfortunately, he is raising a number of technicalities which would require me to look rather quickly at different parts of the Bill, so I decline his invitation to answer at this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining clauses in Part I are essentially procedural. Clause 6(1)(	<i>a</i>) contains an important new provision. When land extending to two hectares, that is 4.942 acres, is being registered and the proprietor is a feuar or long leaseholder, the Keeper must disclose this in the title sheet concerned. This will be a useful provision adding greater precision to the register as a source of information about the extend of individual ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part II of the Bill relates to indemnity arising through loss due to error in the new register. Clauses 12 and 13 specify the circumstances governing entitlement, and clause 14 contains provisions for safeguarding the Crown's rights in the foreshore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 15 to 19, forming Part III, pro-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
vide for various simplifications in the forms of property deeds. Most of these clauses apply to the register of sasines as well as the land register. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) may find some of the treasure he is seeking in those clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 20 to 30, comprising Part IV of the Bill, are in the main procedural and consequential. Clause 20, however, makes provision to assist a special class of tenants, numerically very small, known as tenants-at-will, to acquire the landlord's interest in the land in question and to have it recorded in the register. Tenancies-at-will are a form of unwritten tenancy, most commonly to be found in the north-east counties. In the absence of any written title, the occupants have hitherto been unable to record title, and have thus often been inhibited from carrying out improvements in their property through inability to offer security against a building society mortgage. The change proposed will, I feel sure, be warmly welcomed. Strictly speaking, these people have held an uncomfortable tenure midway between tenancy and true ownership of land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Fairgrieve 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the anomalies and problems being caused currently, which Members in the North-East frequently hear about from their constituents, will now finally be cleared up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not feel that I need detain the Committee longer with detailed explanation. While much of the Bill necessarily deals with what may appear to be legal and technical matter, essentially the Bill is concerned to effect a highly desirable modernisation and streamlining of the processes of registration of title to land in Scotland, and by means of the system of indemnity against error in the land register to introduce a degree of protection to the individual citizen hitherto lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has already received a warm welcome within the legal profession, since in the long run it will bring about an altogether speedier and surer process of registration of obvious benefit to all concerned in property conveyancing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the matter goes well beyond the convenience of the legal profession. The more modern processes of registration should themselves in due course, once the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
new system is fully in operation, bring direct benefit to the public because of the scope which they afford for reduction in relative costs, as compared with those under the present system were it to continue unchanged. And the Law Society—here I revert to a point put to me earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen)—accepts that in due course there should be beneficial effects on conveyancing costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that this useful measure, providing for a necessary modernising of land registration procedures, will be generally welcomed in Scotland, and I confidently commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.44 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Rifkind 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Pentlands)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Lord Advocate on his introductory speech in support of the Bill, and I assure him that the Opposition are happy to give its general provisions a warm welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Advocate said that the Bill had its birth in the report of the Henry committee. I have to point out that its period of gestation has been so long as to make that of the elephant seem rapid in comparison. The original proposals for registration of land title date from the appointment of a Royal Commission in 1906 to inquire into the
	<br><blockquote><p>"expediency of instituting in Scotland a system of registration of title".</p></blockquote>
It is of interest that the Royal Commission of 1906 failed to reach agreement. It produced four reports, and the only thing those reports had in common was that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"introduction of registration of title should not be delayed".</p></blockquote>
The fact that, despite that unanimous suggestion, it has taken some 73 years for a Bill to come forward suggests that for once we can blame not only Conservative and Labour Governments for the delay but even Liberal Governments, who have contributed to the failure to deal with this matter in as timeous a fashion as would have been appropriate. That is something for which the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Liberal Party will no doubt wish to do penance when he makes his speech to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of those members of the Committee who are under 50, can my hon. Friend remind us what a Liberal Government is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. and learned Friend, I am not in a position to speak from personal experience in these matters. Indeed, I doubt that even the Leader of the Liberal Party can benefit the Committee in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must now make one limited complaint to the Committeee, and to the Government in particular. The Lord Advocate pointed out that the report was based on the recommendations of the Henry committee. When, some time ago, I sought to get a copy of the Henry report from the Vote Office, I was told that it was out of print. When I then went to the House of Commons Library, it was unable to obtain a copy for me, as was the House of Lords Library. It was only thanks to the private secretary to the Lord Advocate that I was able to obtain a copy of the report. I see that copies are in the room today, but it is unfortunate if, especially on such a complicated matter, members of the Committee have to wait until the morning on which consideration of the Bill is to take place before they can see the report on which it is based. I give grateful thanks to the Lord Advocate's private secretary for providing me with a copy, but I hope that this practice will not be repeated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When can I have it back?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Lord Advocate has said that the Bill will be welcome in Scotland, and I think that there are two main reasons for that. It should lead to a reduction in costs for house purchases. It would be intolerable if solicitors' fees based on the present system were not reduced to some extent as the Bill is progressively implemented throughout Scotland. The level of fees charged to the house purchaser at present is based on the amount of work that has to be carried out, and I have no doubt that the Law Society will be only too happy to reconsider this matter when the time comes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extraordinary assertion. As a matter of accuracy, the amount of money received in fees is related to the value of the house and not to the work done at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is of course correct that there is a scale. But I presume that when the scale was first established the fact was taken into account
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
that for a high proportion of properties—indeed, for all properties that were not recently built—a substantial amount of work was required to satisfy the conveyancing requirements. If the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is seriously suggesting that there would be no justification for any reduction in conveyancing fees as a result of the provisions of the Bill, I suspect that that view would not be shared by most of his professional colleagues or by any member of this Committee. That would be a poor suggestion, and I am sure that he did not mean to make it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not make it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So we see the Bill as being a modest contribution towards solving the problems of house purchasers in Scotland, problems that have been exacerbated over the past five years because of the increase in house purchasing. Anything which might increase in house purchasing. Anything which might help to reduce that burden must be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will also simplify the process of house purchase north of the border. The Lord Advocate pointed out how registration of title in Scotland has existed since 1617. It is a system which has in the past been very superior to that in other parts of the United Kingdom. I understand that in England a similar process of registration was not available until the latter part of the last century. This is one area in which Scotland has led. Nevertheless, there have been many serious complications and bureaucratic procedures which, given the scale of house purchase at present, have been highly unsatisfactory and need to be rectified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know, for example, how over the last 20 to 30 years many of the old estates throughout Scotland have been broken up into smaller units. Therefore, the complexities involved in conveyancing have been that much more serious because of the existing procedure of registration of deeds. We know also that many larger houses have been broken into smaller units or flats. That, too, has created growing problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was pointed out in the Reid committee's proposals, on which the Henry report was based, that in 1935 46,000 writs were registered in the register of sasines. By 1958 the number had gone up from 46,000 to 84,000 and by 1960 had reached
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
97,000. Perhaps the Minister can give the up-to-date figures as to the number of writs currently registered in the register of sasines. These figures clearly demonstrate a massive increase in the number of property purchases taking place in Scotland and show how a system which may have been appropriate 40 or 50 years ago is inadequate to deal with the present scale of problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put a number of questions to the Minister, but I must apologise to him for the fact that I shall be able only to read his answers as I have to leave the Committee—but it is due to reasons beyond my control—and I look forward with great interest to reading the Minister's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will the Minister tell the basis on which the estimate of 25 to 30 years before the Bill is fully implemented throughout Scotland has been made? Clearly, this is not a change that can be instituted overnight, but periods of 25 to 30 years is an incredibly long time for an important reform of this sort to take place. One appreciates that the Government are working on the basis that when a person sells a house he should be required to use the provisions of the Bill and it should not apply between sales, but it would be interesting to know the basis on which the period of 25 to 30 years has been based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of the Bill are to be progressively instituted in various parts of Scotland. May we know the criteria that will determine which areas will first receive the benefits of the Bill? This point was considered by the Reid committee, and it suggested that it would be desirable if the new procedure could first be implemented in a part of Scotland which had both rural and urban characteristics in order that the problems that will undoubtedly arise from detailed implementation could be tested. The benefits of that experience could then be used in gradually implementing the Bill in other parts of Scotland. I believe that this would be desirable if we start by implementing the Bill in a city or a rural area that will give us only limited experience of its consequences.

As I understand it, the Bill allows voluntary registration by an owner who is not in the process of selling his property, but it specifically states that the Keeper of the Registers need only consider that application when he considers it expedient to do so. The issue of expediency is nowhere defined in the Bill, and I shall be
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
grateful if the Minister will indicate the constraints that are expected to apply to the Keeper's decision in that regard. It seems to me that if a person wishes to have the registration of his property in the new register then, within reason, it should be agreed to in normal circumstances. At present, the Bill seems vague on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point I put to the Minister deals with the question of the State indemnity to be provided wherever a registration is seen to have been carried out in error. In its deliberations on this matter the Reid committee pointed out that the State indemnity, which has already existed in England for some time, has not resulted in any substantial amount of public funds being required, so that no separate fund should be established in Scotland to meet this indemnity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it intended that a separate fund should be established in Scotland, or will money simply be made available as the Reid committee recommended, out of the moneys provided generally by Parliament? Also, where the fault which leads to the indemnity being paid is the result of false information given to the Keeper, will the Keeper, on behalf of the public interest, be able to recover such sums from the person who had given the wrong information or had led to the error being made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point that I raise with the Minister at this stage relates to a matter which the Government have not taken up, despite the recommendations of the Reid committee. The report of that committee, at page 17, points to the fact that on the first time a property was registered the fees for doing so might be substantially greater than even the present fees. It says in paragraph 65:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… one disadvantage would be that the cost of first registration of title would considerably exceed the dues payable at present. If registration of title is introduced, we think that consideration should be given to the possibility of subsidising the cost of first registration, with a scale of dues for subsequent registration which would enable such a subsidy to be repaid over a period of years."</p></blockquote>
That seems to me a very sensible and constructive suggestion, which, as far as I know, has not been followed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, all hon. Members will wish to reduce costs. If this welcome reform leads, in the first instance, because of the complexity of the first registration of title, to an immediate increase in costs, I suggest that the alternative procedure proposed by the Reid committee is deserving of consideration. Have the Government con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
sidered the matter and, if so, why have they not felt it appropriate to include such a provision in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say again that the Opposition welcome the Bill. We hope to hasten its passage through the House. Undoubtedly, we shall wish to make a number of detailed improvements, but we wish the Bill well and we are glad that the Government have at last brought forward such a measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.52 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is a very modest response to demands that some of us in the House have been making for some time now for the compilation of a land register in Scotland. When I raised the matter on previous occasions, in parliamentary questions and so on, I have always been told by Government spokesmen that the whole business would be far too expensive and far too complicated. So I am glad to see that the Government have been partially converted to our point of view in this, as I call it, modest measure. In many respects the Bill is far too modest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently there has been much debate on the subject of land ownership and land use and about the inequitable distribution of land ownership in Scotland. Much research has been done. Mr. John MacEwen, for example, managed to compile a register of his own. A great deal of painstaking effort went into that research. I suggest that, under clause 1, Mr. John MacEwen could be made the honorary Keeper of the Land Register of Scotland, in recognition of those efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. MacEwen points out in his book that the top five landowners in Scotland own between them more than one million acres. Recently, there has been a great deal of criticism about foreign landowners—Arabs, Dutchmen, and others—taking over the estates. Whatever we think about Arabs and Dutchmen, I hope that we shall not have a racialist debate about land ownership. Some of the worst landowners, the worst capitalists, in Scotland are Scotsmen themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the excessive ownership of land by some of the huge estate owners. When this measure comes into effect and the register is fully updated, I hope that these facts will come to light and the public will be more aware of the facts of land ownership in Scotland. For example, the Duke of Buccleuch—the ex-Tory Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
of Parliament for Edinburgh, North—has 277,000 acres. Lord Home—an ex-Tory Prime Minister—has 54,000 acres. However, not all of them are Scots, but most of them are Tories. There is Lord Thorney-croft, the chairman of the Tory Party, who has 44,000 acres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In comparison with that lot, when the register comes under the public gaze, even the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) will look a mere pauper, because he has only 6,800 acres in Fife, and 7,200 acres in Midlothian along with other interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When these people go to register their land under the Land Registration (Scotland) Act, as we hope the Bill will have become, I hope that the Keeper of the Registers—this is why I should like Mr. MacEwen to be given the job—will ask to see their titles to the land. I suspect that many of them have very little moral title to the ownership of their huge estates. How did they get them in the first place? What are their title deeds? Some of their ancestors may have been brave men who fought for the land. For example, I am sure that the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) will know that the Earl of Ross was given the ownership of the town of Cromarty as a reward for being on the winning side at the battle of Bannockburn in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whose side was the hon. Gentleman on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of the working class of Bannockburn, unfortunately, were dispossessed, but it is interesting to see that that was how some of those people—the friends of Robert the Bruce—got their land. Some of them, in fact, ran off to change sides when they saw that Bruce was going to win. They changed sides in order to make sure of their reward in the form of land ownership or whatever it might be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman telling us—we should be thrilled to hear it—that he is about to change sides, and could he tell us where he will go?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I point out that, while history lessons are very interesting, we are moving away from the Bill? The hon. Member should come back to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Doig, I realise that. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall not change sides. However, history will be relevant when some people go to the Keeper of the Register and the Keeper asks to see their title to their land. A great deal of historical research must be done on the question of land ownership in many cases. I merely instanced one or two cases. I said that some people's ancestors had fought for the land. Some stole it—the Homes, for example, were well known border cattle rustlers and sheep-stealers—and some married into it. In those cases the Keeper will have to look back through the marriage records. To instance another case which I have managed to dig up myself,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Buchanan states that the aged Lord Hamilton in 1474 married Princess Mary, eldest daughter of King James II, and that this lady had been forced to forsake her legal husband,"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must point out that the hon. Member is going very wide of the Bill. He must relate his remarks or arguments to the Bill. This information is very interesting, but we cannot take up the time of the Committee on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister sums up, perhaps he will tell me whether, for example, when the present owner of the estates to which I refer goes to the Keeper to register his alleged ownership of the land, I shall have the right to go and quote the following facts about his title to ownership!
	<br><blockquote><p>"Thus did the House of Hamilton 'wed into Royal blood,' and it is not strange that with the lady came the 'lands and baronies' of Arran. Pretensions were now made to the throne of Scotland, and the third Lord Hamilton acquired the suggestive habit of signing himself 'James G.' or simply 'James.'"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot allow the hon. Member to carry on in this manner. We are not discussing all the details of how titles came into existence. We are discussing the principle of registration. The hon. Member will have to keep his remarks along those lines if he wishes to remain in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Doig, we are certainly discussing the principle of registration, but if they are to register their land, I presume that the people concerned will have to produce some evidence of land ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is not for us to consider that evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for us to consider particular instances. I was referring to the ancestors of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). It may well be that in the Hamilton family now patronage is limited to the Whips' offices on both sides of the House. But it appears that the big brother of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West still has 52,000 acres of land in East Lothian. When he comes along to the Keeper of the Registers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an interest in a quarter of a third in a farming unit, and my brother has an interest in only 6,000 acres, which is nothing like 52,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. John MacEwen has apparently dug up evidence of 52,000 acres—[hon. Members: "Wrong."]—which illustrates the point. When the Minister is summing up I hope that he will reply to that point. If John MacEwen claims that the big brother of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West has 52,000 acres and the Duke himself and his brother claim that he only has 6,000, will John MacEwen be given the opportunity to go along to the Keeper, and shall I be given the opportunity to go to the Keeper, in order to challenge these titles? It is extremely relevant to the content of the Bill. On Second Reading we should consider the general principle of the Bill and also the wider repercussions of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that because of the dramatic increase in support for the Conservative Party recently, it is statistically inevitable that a lot of land in Scotland must be owned by Conservatives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed. Certain things are almost inevitable because of historical fact. But when we are putting a Bill through the House of Commons, we are supposed to be changing the situation that we inherited in order to make a better and fairer future. Surely, in considering the question of land ownership through this register, we on these Government Benches should be taking the opportunity to change the situation we inherited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The priority in compiling this register
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
according to the terms of the Bill seems to be simply to look at the land transactions first—when people are buying or selling land and they come along to have their ownership registered. I suggest that greater priority should be given under the Bill to the ownership and registration of ownership of the large estates to which I have been addressing myself. That is the kernel of the problem of land ownership in Scotland. I hope that the Minister will consider that and give greater priority to registration of estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that in the debate in the House of Lords it was said that the change introduced by the Bill would be done county by county and, for some reason or other, some of the rural counties which contain the big estates will come at the end. It may be 20 or 30 years—I think that that was the figure Lord McCluskey gave—before the register is completed. Greater priority should be given to the large estates, and I hope that the Government will consider that during the passage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This has not been a good week for him or for his colleagues, including the chairman, in the Scottish Labour Party. I had hoped that we should hear the speech that he was unable to deliver last Saturday for various reasons, but I am sure he is keeping it in store for us as a treat on a future occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Rifkind), who led for the Conservative Party, referred to the delay in dealing with this matter, mentioning 1906 as the day that this reform was first mooted as a possibility. That is a clear example of how Westminster is totally unable to legislate for Scottish matters effectively over a period of time, and how right the hon. Member for Pentlands was, almost alone among his colleagues, to take the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
view that he should vote "Yes" in the referendum. I am sure that what he has said this morning reinforces that view forcibly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should also remind the Committee that I pointed out that the Royal Commission in 1906 failed to agree on a proper system of registration. It produced four separate reports and agreed only about the need for a registration of title.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a characteristic of some Royal Commissions. The Kilbrandon Commission, as I recollect, did not entirely agree on every matter. But the point remains that the subject has been regarded as important. It was brought to the attention of the House by a Royal Commission in 1906, 73 years ago, yet we legislate for it only now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Advocate referred to the Bill as useful. The advice I have from learned colleagues is that it is certainly, technically, a very useful Bill, but, like the honourable Member for West Stirlingshire, I certainly do not consider that it is a radical proposal or that it deals with many of the major problems of land use, ownership and alienation of ownership which concern the people of Scotland at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems now arise where there is great institutional buying of land in Scotland. When I spoke to my local branch of the National Farmers' Union I found that one matter concerning it very seriously was the institutional buying of land by insurance companies, pension funds and others. I take the honourable Gentleman's point about absentee landlords—of whatever nationality. One might instance the Secretary of State for Scotland as coming in that category, since I believe that he lives in London but is the landlord of a very large part of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Government have not brought forward a more radical proposal. I was led to believe when we talked of this matter before, that we should see something which would get to the roots of many of the problems of land use in Scotland. I do not think that the Lord Advocate claimed in his speech, or would claim that the Bill in any way deals with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The institutional buying of land is a very difficult current problem. I do not know whether I am anticipating
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the honourable Gentleman's speech, but can he make some suggestions as to how one stops or controls it without either putting up the price of land by taxing it when it changes to institutions or making the price collapse because institutions do not buy land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly send a copy of our proposals to the honourable and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn), although I should have thought that he would already have been aware of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the specific provisions in the Bill. I wish to raise certain points with which I hope the Minister may be able to deal, if not today, when the Bill goes to Committee. The first point I noticed when reading the reports of the debates in the other place was that it is estimated that some 260,000 conveyances a year are going through the register of sasines at present. Can the Minister give us any indication as to how long the Government estimate it will take to register all land in Scotland and all heritable interest on the new register? That is a fair question to ask, because the Government must have done some assessments on this matter before the Bill was brought forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the cost reduction there will be to the public in land transactions. I thought that the Lord Advocate was let off very lightly when this point was raised. He is shaking his head, but he knows that he was. It is not enough to bring forward the Bill and to say that at some remote date in the future the cost to the individual of buying or selling a house is likely to decrease. Surely the Government have made some estimate; surely they have had discussions with the Law Society on the appropriate scale of fees in these new situations and on what reduction of cost the public can look forward to in carrying out a land transaction. We cannot let the Minister off with the rather bland answer that there might be a cost reduction in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that for many people having to find a deposit for a house and pay legal fees on top of that is one of the greatest deterrents to house ownership in Scotland. I hope that we can have a much clearer indication of the reductions in legal fees that might result from this measure than the Lord Advocate was initially prepared to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong to give any impression that might be misleading in this regard. I want to make clear to the honourable Gentleman that the relative cost of conveyancing and registration will be reduced by the Bill, but it would be a bold person who would now say that inflation will come to a complete stop during the next 20 or 30 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I think that the Lord Advocate is trying to wriggle out of this matter. That is quite uncharacteristic of him, and I am sure that he felt deeply ashamed of what he just said the moment he sat down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving aside the question of inflation and talking in terms of the real present day value of money, does the Lord Advocate see a 10 per cent, or a 25 per cent, reduction? I see the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) blanch at that thought. Does the Lord Advocate see a 33½ per cent, reduction? We are entitled to ask the Government what sort of reduction they envisage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamish Gray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross and Cromarty)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman is not sufficiently naive to believe that anybody in that profession, from either side of the House, will give any positive statement about any reduction in fees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty makes a point which, had I a suspicious mind, perhaps would have crossed it earlier. This may be very funny, but the average person outside the Committee will look at this legislation and ask whether it will make it cheaper or dearer to buy a house. If it will make it cheaper, roughly by how much? In summing up, will the Minister tell us whether he has had discussions with the Law Society on the specific point of the fees for house purchase as a result of this change? I await his summing up with interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point I wish to make about the Bill to some extent concerns the point made by the hon. Minister for West Stirlingshire. This was that we are dealing with the Land Registration (Scotland) Bill, but this does not necessarily identify the owners of the land. I give notice to the Committee that we intend to table an amendment which will require the ultimate beneficial owner of the land to be registered to be disclosed and stated on the deed by a certificate from the solicitor concerned.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Lots of properties are being registered in the names of nominee companies and all sorts of strange holdings and I believe that if we are to go forward with this reform it is right that we should be able to identify the ultimate beneficial owner of any particular land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that under the Companies Act 1967, for example, if 5 per cent, or more of the share capital of a company is owned by a nominee company, the nominee company is required, upon request, to disclose the beneficial owner. I do not see why a similar provision should not apply in the case of land ownership. Following that, I ask whether it will be possible to accumulate details of the total ownership held by any individual or company throughout the register. It may be possible—I await the Governments response to this point with interest—to require the solicitor registering the deed to certify what other properties on the land register are already in the ownership of the person who has been registered as the ultimate beneficial owner. I hope that as a result of this measure, the Keeper will have a duty laid upon him to make available on request such information about the total ownership of any person or company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very serious and fundamental point and it would be a great pity if we were to proceed with the Bill without providing the machinery for us to be able to identify the actual owners of the land of Scotland and how much any individual or company owns. I sometimes think it is silly, when one sees clan maps outside tartan shops showing that the Frasers were here and the Macdonalds there, that we have no idea of who actually owns that land in reality. It would be nice to have a land map of Scotland showing the actual owners of that land. For example, when the Duke of Westminster met his demise a few weeks ago, I noticed it was said that he owned 100,000 acres in Scotland and I wondered why on earth he should have owned 100,000 acres in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I hope that there will be some support for my proposal that we should be able to identify the beneficial owner of the land and accumulate a total of how much that person owns throughout the register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Government to consider the question of identification of ownersership so that they can accumulate details on the total ownership of any one person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to a clause which I and my constituents and others in various parts of north-east Scotland consider to be very important, namely, clause 20 relating to tenants-at-will. May I start by saying how much I appreciate the attitude that the Government have taken in giving tenants-at-will a square deal for the very first time. I pay tribute to the personal interest taken in the matter by the Lord Advocate and by other members of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been bombarding the Government with letters on this subject over the past four to five years. Last year they altered a Bill in order to give tenants-at-will the right to obtain improvement grants. This mea-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
sure will allow tenants-at-will to obtain a proper title. I welcome that, although it is long overdue. However, I thank the Government for the consideration they have given to my constituents and to those in other constituencies in north-east Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recollect that on 25 June 1974 I raised the subject in this Committee. It was one of the first speeches that I made in the Scottish Grand Committee. At that time, I thought that there was some sympathy and understanding from the Government. It has taken five years, but I am glad that it has now come to fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenancies-at-will are such an extraordinary form of tenure in Scotland that most honourable Members are probably unaware of what they are. Indeed, until I went to the North-East I had never heard of them. What happens is that the land is owned by one person and the buildings on it are owned by someone else. Many of these tenancies were created when the fishing villages grew up around the Scottish coasts. So that they could be induced to live in these villages, fishermen were offered the land at a ground rent of about 25p to£1.25 per annum on condition that they built a house on it. Some of them were given a one-and-a-half tenancy so that they could build a smaller house adjacent to it for someone in the family. Properties changed hands in the same way as motor cars do. The estate was informed that the property had changed hands, either by sale or by heritable transmission, and the entry was made in the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years there was no problem, until about 25 years ago when housing grants become available for modernisation. Many tenants then requested feudal deeds in order to qualify for housing grants. At that time there was little difficulty in obtaining those deeds. It has been only in recent years, with the increase in land and house values, that certain of the lairds and landlords in the North-East have taken a punitive attitude towards tenants-at-will. Many people have been unable for years to put a modern bathroom into their house or modernise their kitchen because the landlord would not give them a feudal title. In some cases landlords did not even reply to letters sent to them. I need hardly say of which political complexion these landlords are. Now, at last, there is to be a statutory right for tenants-at-will to obtain title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection I want to raise with the Minister two points which relate to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
basis of purchase. In clause 20(3)(	<i>b</i>), the amount stated is
	<br><blockquote><p>"one twenty-fifth of the value of the tenancy land, including any buildings thereon".</p></blockquote>
Does this mean that the tenant-at-will will have to pay for the value of the building which he put on the land? Should the provision not be worded
	<br><blockquote><p>"one twenty-fifth of the value of the tenancy land excluding any buildings thereon"</p></blockquote>
because it is only the land that he is seeking to obtain?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know the basis for that provision and also why it is one twenty-fifth rather than, for example, one-fiftieth. Since the feuduty can be redeemed on a multiple of the amount of feuduty, why should the amount payable here not be a multiple of the amount of the ground rent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall understand if the Minister is not in a position to make a detailed response today, but I hope that he will give the matter consideration so that it can be dealt with when the Bill reaches Committee. If it is to be the total value of the unit of the land and the buildings, a tenant-at-will could have to meet a sizeable sum. Now it is known that titles can be obtained, the value of these units may well inflate within the next few weeks. Whereas the value of a property might at the moment be only, say,£4,000, as a result of this measure it might go up to£10,000 or£12,000. Is that the figure on which the tenant-at-will will have to pay one twenty-fifth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Harry Ewing)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 20 gives a series of alternatives through which the tenancy could be purchased, and at the top of page 17 comes the phrase "whichever is the lesser". The honourable Gentleman should read the alternatives. With respect, he has picked out one criterion, whereas there is a series.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that response. However, it might help in the alternatives if we excluded the words "including any buildings thereon". If it is the land that is being transferred, any payment should relate only to the land and not to the building which the tenant-at-will or his predecessor in title has put there. But I leave that point for the moment. It is one which can be explored in more depth in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to subsection (5) of clause 20. I have been advised that this type of clause, which was in the Crofters Act, has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
been a source of concern and expense to many people. I see no reason why each side should not pay its own legal expenses, the landlord paying his legal expenses and the tenant paying his. The onus should be on the landlord to provide a plan. One comment about Crofters Act is that has given a tremendous bonanza to surveyors who have had to prepare these plans, the expense of which can be substantial, particularly when records are not as good as they might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I ask the Government to consider laying the onus for preparing and providing plan on the landlord, altering the basis of payment of expenses so that each side pays his own instead of the tenant-at-will being responsible for them all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are points of detail of which it is right to give advance notice at this stage. They can be considered later. But I repeat that for several hundred families in the North-East—for tenants-at-will—this legislation is very welcome and long overdue. Without reservation, I thank the Lord Advocate for his personal interest in the matter over a number of years. He has always tried to be helpful, and now his efforts have come to fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the Bill is useful rather than radical. I hope that there will be some support in Committee for attempts to make it somewhat more radical. Having said that, I assure the Government that my hon. Friends and I will thoroughly support the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Bill. I do not consider it as modest a measure as some people have suggested. It deals with a specified and comparatively narrow field, but within that field it brings in real and very important changes which we have awaited for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard the Bill with a certain affection because I remember the publication of the Henry Committee report in 1969, when I was in this place. I find it rather strange that eight years later I am just in time—as one might say—to see the measures implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to comment on the effect on conveyancing. I was in the House for four and a half years and then spent five years outside the law—(	<i>laughter.</i>)—No—I talk in terms of the tools of the trade. I came
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
back to find that there had been quite important changes in conveyancing reform as a result of the Halliday committee report, which was an interim stage while we waited Henry. I suppose I should declare an interest in that I am still technically, or somewhat distantly, involved in the practice of the law. When I came back, I discovered that such familiar things as 	<i>ex facie</i> absolute disposition had disappeared and the standard security ruled in its place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think this legislation is important. There are only one or two points that I should like the Minister to consider and perhaps reply to at his leisure. I do not accept that the Bill is likely to have any great impact in the short-term on conveyancing costs. We must accept that, in the short term, the process of compiling the first title for initial registration is likely to create as much work as there is in present conveyancing transactions. But I am extremely interested in what has been said by other Members of the Committee about the long-term impacts of the legislation on conveyancing costs. While I accept that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) probably innocently misunderstood me, I hope that there was nothing in my earlier intervention which could lead anyone to believe that I was anything but extremely interested in seeing a diminution in conveyancing costs as a result of reform such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I accept that the overall benefit of reduced conveyancing costs will grow as the changes take place in the register, will the honourable Gentleman not accept that in the case of modern houses in particular, the turnover is so great that within a few years or even a year or two, one would find that a house changed hands a number of times before the new system operated, but that once one was on to the new system the conveyancing charges for that property could drop fairly quickly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would hope so. That is exactly what I am trying to probe. Every one of us who has been in the legal profession is unhappy about the basis on which conveyancing charges are organised at present. I was making to the honourable Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands the self-evident point that under the existing system the solicitor gets a bigger fee according to the value of the property
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
being purchased or sold by his client. If a solicitor is selling or buying a nice neat modern bungalow on an estate completed by a speculative builder within the last seven or eight years, the amount of work may be extremely small. The solicitor's office may have bought and sold so many properties on that estate that he is already familiar with the title of the estate and does not have to note the title back through the years. He has merely to examine one writ very superficially, change a few points in it, reproduce it, sign it, and that is the end of his road. It is farcical that the solicitor can earn a substantial fee—perhaps£300 if he takes the total allowed by the Law-Society—for what is very small amount of work. However, to be fair to the legal profession, one could also get oneself trapped in handling the buying of a small flat, for example, in tenement property where the fee, because it is a scale fee on value, may be very small but for which one has to do an enormous amount of chasing around and digging into ancient documents for very little reward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a rather crazy situation—I am sure my honourable Friend the Under-Secretary of State will appreciate this—in which very often the amount of money one receives is in inverse proportion to the amount of work one has to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>THE CHAIRMAN's 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that seventeen Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and seventeen Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We heard that in the proceedings in another place Lord McCluskey described the phasing in of the new proposals. I raised the matter briefly in an intervention earlier this morning. It is clear that the phasing will take place in nine stages. No doubt the honourable Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) who is about to reply for the Opposition, will be distressed to see that Ayr appears in year seven—well down the list—although it has a large number of bungalows and bourgeoisie staying therein who might well be considered as having a genuine interest in conveyancing costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I raise is serious. If a start is made in year one in Renfrew and in year two in Glasgow, and if we move through to Ayr in year seven, clearly the phasing in will take place over a lengthy period. I shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
be fascinated to know how the Law Society—it is as much its business as anyone else's and the Government must have a great influence on it—envisages this happening. We shall have, at the same time, some parts of Scotland in which a large amount of property is registered, and other parts where the full rigours of feudal conveyancing are still in operation because no property will be registered at all. Even in those parts where registration has started, we shall have properties which are registered—in areas where there is a large turnover of property and married couples are making their first buy and then moving on—and going into their second or third sale, while a large number of other transactions will be taking place on the basis of the first sale after the register has been introduced. Clearly, an enormous amount of work will have to be done to ensure that there is a proper prescriptive progress of property where the first important entry is being made on the register from which registration will proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we assume—I certainly assume it and press the Government to fight for it—a situation in which once a property is registered future transactions attract much lower conveyancing fees, will those in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ayr be victimised, perhaps for several years, because it will be much more expensive to buy and sell there than it will in those areas where the system has more speedily been introduced? Does it mean that we will try to get over that by having a unified conveyancing scale throughout the country—whether it is feudal, registered or at whatever stage—and if so, on what basis should it be organised?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are very important points. I recognise that it is difficult to answer at this stage, but it would be unsatisfactory if we did not have some sort of indication of Government thinking and of the pattern of consultation which surely must have taken place with the Law Society on this very important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise a technical matter, to which I am sure there is a simple answer but which I, as a conveyancer, have not grasped. In the part of Glasgow in which I live there are large, substantial, Victorian villas—a common phenomenon now—which have been subdivided two, three or four times. The first time they are subdivided, there is quite a complicated performance. There may be rights of access through back gardens or out-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
buildings to be divided. There may be problems of common repairs. I am curious to know how that will be handled in a title which has been registered as a single house but which at the first change is to be subdivided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, at that point there will have to be some deed which sets out the rights of the parties, those who are buying one of the sub-divisions, and it may be—perhaps this is not a great problem—that we shall need some sort of deed of conditions as a separate entity from the entry on the register of titles. I am not sure about that, and perhaps the register of titles will encompass all the information, but this is a matter where a little guidance and help at some point in the progress of the Bill, would assist hon. Members to explain matters to their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having raised these few simple points, I do not wish to delay the Committee. I welcome the Bill strongly because I recognise, as, I believe, almost all members of the Committee recognise, that we shall have an important job to do in Scotland in terms of aiding those who wish to own their own homes. Sometimes there is a myth that the Labour Party is opposed to home ownership per se, but that does not stand up to the examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Home ownership is not, perhaps, as burning an issue in Garscadden as it is in South Aberdeen which I once had the pleasure to represent, where any member of the Labour Party who hoped to represent that seat certainly had to get a wide degree of support from those who owned their own homes. As someone with a constituency with 96 per cent, council houses, I believes that it comes well from me to say that the Government have been right to try to encourage and help those who want to own their own houses. I remind honourable Members of the option mortgage for example, and the recent home loan scheme introduced by this Labour Government, whereby, if one saves on a regular basis one will get£600 towards one's loan interest free for a period of five years and a cash bonus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These things serve to underline that we accept that the present situation, with a much smaller private sector in Scotland than in other parts of the country or almost any part of Western Europe, is not necessarily bad per se but it would be bad if it were caused by there being no opportunity to own one's home. There is an
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
opening here for individuals to decide whether to exercise their right to take up that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that people will notice, when considering the option mortgage, the home loan scheme and now the first really constructive and effective attempt to reduce the cost of buying one's house in terms of legal and conveyancing fees, that this has happened under a Labour Government. For these reasons, I believe this to be a particularly important Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am familiar, as no doubt are other members of the Committee, with the standard scale of fees of the Law Society of Scotland in relation to both the purchase price of a house and the mortgage. This is extremely expensive and, I am afraid, a resented imposition. In some ways, too, it is resented by the legal profession, which does not like the opprobrium which results in all the brief debates in the House of Lords that I have read, the most surprising remark was made by Lord Fraser of Tullybeton, whom I believe to be a Law Lord, who referred to conveyancing as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a great deal of rather dull and not very remunerative work to the legal profession."-(	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 5 December 1978; Vol. 397, c. 81).</p></blockquote>
It is questionable whether it is remunerative. I certainly endorse that it is dull, having suffered briefly in a conveyancing department in my youth. But the important point is that the legal profession would be the first to say that if the work were cut back and put upon a more logical basis, there can be a more rational and sensible fees structure. I do not believe that there would be any opposition from the Law Society or anyone who practises the law if that were done and in return there were a reduction in fees and the costs of purchasing a house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it seems that the Bill may be fairly dull and not as revolutionary as my honourable Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) suggested in terms of land ownership such as he or I would like to see in the long term. But in the context of practical politics this seems an extremely useful measure. Above all, I hope that the Government will keep in the forefront of their minds that this is an opportunity to reduce conveyancing costs and to bring the opportunity of buying a house within the reach of people who find it difficult at present. That, as much as the technical details, must be kept in the forefront of the Government's mind. If they do that I am sure that my right honourable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
and honourable Friends on the Front Bench will keep these matters in mind—this will be a particularly useful and popular measure in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamish Gray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross and Cromarty)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I find myself more in agreement with his sentiments on this aspect of law than when he is talking about criminal law. It is interesting that he, as a solicitor, should be the person in the Committee who has expressed the greatest concern about legal fees. Those of us who are laymen certainly agree with all that he has said. I suspect that, when he was in private practice, he was one of those solicitors who always had a little note at the end of his fee saying "restricted to", at which everyone trembles, thinking what it might have been had it not been "restricted to".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is true that many solicitors restrict for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. But will he also accept that there are other people who make an enormous killing out of the buying and selling of houses, and that the estate agent's fee is often considerably larger than the lawyer's fee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly fair point, although it is also fair to say that when estate agents do a lot of conveyancing the lawyers' fees are perhaps rather more competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a word about the need for the Bill. The Opposition certainly welcome it. The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) went to great lengths to outline land ownership in Scotland—how the land had been acquired by landowners and how it had sometimes been given. Indeed, he suggested that sometimes it had even been stolen. But I think we should put the whole matter in its proper context. After all, the biggest landowner in Scotland—owning 19 million acres—is the Secretary of State for Scotland. Of those 19 million acres, 1.8 million acres are under forestry and 2.3 million acres are under agriculture. Later, I shall deal with the management of land, but we should remember those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities also own a great deal of land. Strathclyde alone owns more than 80,000 acres. The Law Society estimates that less than 5 per cent, of all agricultural land in Scotland is actually under foreign ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
As we are dealing with facts and figures about land ownership, I should highlight the point that it is not only on the Opposition side that there is considerable land ownership. There are people on the Government side who have very strong interests in land ownership. Indeed, the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) is one of the biggest farmers in that area, owning, I understand, more than 900 acres. It is poppycock for the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire to try to suggest that it is Conservative Members who own the land, when he has sitting on his own Benches a latter-day Reggie Paget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I must point out to the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) that we should confine our remarks to the Bill. After all, there is a Committee stage coming and maybe the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why there is such a need for this type of legislation is that over the years, because of the policies of successive Governments, the traditional pattern of ownership has changed. Because of the taxation system in this country, there is almost no way in which land can be passed from one generation to another. It is virtually impossible to pass, say, a 500-acre or 600-acre farm from father to son, because, with capital transfer tax and general death duties over the years, the penalties have become so severe that the only way in which it can be done nowadays is by selling to an institution and obtaining a lease-back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the honourable Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) rightly pointed out, this kind of institutional buying is very worrying. It is all right where the purchaser is prepared to grant to the tenant a long lease. But even a long lease is usually subject to reviews at five, 10 or 20-year periods, and one may be sure that when these reviews take place the institution which has purchased the land—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I tell the honourable Gentleman to stick to the Bill again? I am sorry to have to keep pulling him up, but he is away from the terms of the Bill altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what you say, Mr. Doig, but I think that I am being relevant and I shall return to the Bill in a moment.
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
This is the Second Reading debate, we are dealing with the principle, and it is important that we look at all the relative facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 of the Bill mentions management and control. When the Minister replies, will he touch on the extent to which management will come into this? Obviously there will be an element of control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Again, I point out that there is nothing about land management in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 refers to "management and control". (Honourable Members: "Of the register".) All right, of the register, but it is referring to the land, so we can deal with it. Will the Minister deal with that point and also with the question of the transfer of interest in clause 2? It might help in a minimal way to tell us some of the details? which the honourable Member for Aberdeenshire, East and I want to know about the transfer of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about one of the things which the Bill does not do. There does not appear to be any provision for finding out the ownership of a company which may be registered outside Scotland—I am thinking of the notorious companies registered in Jersey and similar places—which has nominee directors. It is practically impossible to find out who are the true directors and where the ownership of these companies belongs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention in passing a case in my own constituency concerning a sandbank at Nigg Bay. This sandbank changed hands at enormous profit from one source to another. I went to a great deal of bother. I wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland and asked him to try to determine ownership of the land. He was unable to do so. I wrote to the Secretary of State for Trade and asked whether he would consider amending the Companies Act. The Companies Bill which is going through Parliament at present does not deal with the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very worrying to people when they are unable to discover ownership by a company registered outside the United Kingdom. Could the Minister say whether there is any way by which we could table a suitable amendment in Committee to take account of that point? I know that legally it is extremely difficult, but this may well be a Bill in which we could look more closely at the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
I do not wish to say more. There is the question of the Bill's relationship with other legislation which will have to be amended. Could the Minister say what affect the Bill will have on the recent crofting legislation? In dealing with that he may be prepared to say a word or two about the crofting Acts with regard to the point made by the honourable Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) about the type of tenancy in the north-east of Scotland.

Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray), I welcome the Bill. I welcome anything which simplifies conveyancing. Although I have suffered under Professor Henry, the author of this report, I pay tribute to the fact that his fascination with the subject has resulted in it being simplified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) in his introduction to the subject of conveyancing, took me into the realms of a phenomenon which was far beyond my capacity ever to grasp. Indeed, it reminded me of one of the occasions when the Almighty intervened in my life. I realised that I should never be able to master the subject for my conveyancing exam, so I decided to sit the Faculty of Advocate's exam as well as the university exam, to have two bites at the Henry cherry. On the first occasion one had to get 70 per cent, to pass. After, for once, doing a little work, I got 8 per cent., which depressed me greatly. On the second occasion, in the university exam, I was unable to understand a single question in paper No. 1 and decided not to go into paper No. 2 but to spend a couple of hours doing nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thereafter, to my amazement, I was allowed an oral exam. I prepared to face the author of this report, Professor Henry, again. On his way up The Mound, he was struck down by a violent pain and conveyed back to his home in an ambulance. The oral then had to take place with the external examiner, who could not even spell the word "conveyancing".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member has never looked back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make one comment on the attitude of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East. I welcome his welcome to the Bill, but the Scottish nationalists' paranoia about racial purity and the ownership of land I find thoroughly inappropriate and obnoxious—a sort of Aryan approach in which nobody who is not proved to be a member of the master race resident in the Greater Reich shall be allowed to touch the sacred soil of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not matter who owns land—if I may say this to the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan)—or how much they own, as long as they look after it properly and farm it productively. That is the criterion on which they should be judged, and that is the criterion upon which we should judge that vast anomalous holding in the name of the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman suggesting that the Conservative Party's policy is that, if a person does not farm land productively, it will do something about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. and learned Gentleman replies, I must point out that up to now he has said hardly anything about what is in the Bill. It may be very interesting to hear his autobiography, but he should try to come back to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am attempting to do in, as Professor Henry rightly said, my inadequate and inevitably incompetent way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anything which helps to reduce the cost of conveyancing is important. I agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) who, with masochistic martyrdom, has agreed to give up the riches and shekels of conveyancing in the interests of his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another way, which I should like the Government to consider in the Bill, to reduce the cost of buying a house. I have always regarded it as a blot on the law of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
Scotland that, in order to buy a house, one has to do so by blind bidding. That means that one may miss a house by a few pounds—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. and learned Gentleman is again getting away from the Bill. That has nothing whatever to do with the Bill. I hope that he will relate his remarks to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying has to do with the Bill, because it has to do with the cost of conveyancing and the Bill is about the registration of titles which result from the sale of houses. Blind bidding often results in people paying for houses thousands of pounds more than the next bidder. In my opinion it is a bad system and it should be replaced by an open auction in a solicitor's office or other central place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one good thing about it, that it stops the vicious English habit of gazumping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting miles away from the Bill. Remarks must be confined to what is in the Bill or to what hon. Members think should be in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Doig, I think this should be in the Bill and I hope that the Government will look at it. The hon. Member for Garscadden raises an important point. It is no alternative to gazumping. Gazumping is caused because they do not have binding missives in England. I myself have been gazumped. But having bought a house in Scotland and been ungazumpable, having written out the missive on the dining-room table of that house, I know that that is what prevents gazumping in Scotland. It has nothing to do with blind bidding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second matter which I should like the Government to consider in the Bill, that is, whether we could have a rule that the seller of a property has a responsibility to produce a surveyor's report among the titles. It seems to me quite wrong, if half-a-dozen young married couples are all bidding for the same house, that each has to get—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That has nothing whatever to do with the Bill. The Bill does not relate to selling houses or anything
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
else. The Bill relates to the registration of the actual ownership, and that is all that it is about. The hon. and learned Gentleman has spoken for quite a long time, and so far he has spoken about almost everything except what is in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, Mr. Doig, you told me to mention anything that I would like to see in the Bill, and I have now mentioned two things that I should like to see in the Bill. I am speaking here of one consequence of the Bill—to make the conveyancing of houses cheaper. Let us be quite clear; if no one ever sells any houses the Bill will never operate, because it is on the sale of a house that the new form of registration will occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. and learned Gentleman extends that logic, if nobody ever built houses there would be no Bill either. Remarks must be kept within the scope of this Bill. Up to now the hon. and learned Gentleman has spoken of virtually nothing that is within the scope of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am making two pleas to the Government. One is to include in this Bill a system of selling houses which gets away from blind bidding and is open. The other is a system at the time of sale to be put into the Bill whereby only one surveyor's report need be obtained, and all the people who wish to bid for that house are entitled, for a fee, to have a sight of it. An up-to-date surveyor's report should be included in the register. Nothing could be more relevant than to include in the register an up-to-date surveyor's report as part of the titles which can be inspected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the hon. and learned Gentleman's point. Would he agree that the real problem here is the building societies? He would have to persuade them to accept the single surveyor's report for the purposes of raising a mortgage. There is nothing more damaging than spending£40 to£50 on a survey to try to get a mortgage—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is completely outside the scope of the Bill. The two hon. Members are both lawyers. They must know that this matter is outside the scope of the Bill. I wish that they would at least try to keep within the scope of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Doig. Am I to understand that this is an entirely different rule from what usually happens on Second Reading? When an hon. Member speaks on the Bill under consideration, usually he is quite entitled to say "I support this Bill because A, B and C, but I have reservations about other aspects of the Bill." In that, he can say what is not included in the Bill and what he would like to be included. That is what we are used to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly in order. But so far none of that has happened. Nothing that the hon. and learned Member has discussed so far would ever be relevant to go into the Bill. Therefore, there is no sense in talking about putting something in the Bill that has no connection with the Bill. Surely, that is understood—perhaps not by the hon. Gentleman, who is a doctor, but it should certainly be clearly understood by a lawyer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that. The hon. Member for Garscadden and my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty having destroyed the solicitors' profession, and I having destroyed the surveyors' profession, you, Mr. Doig, have now debunked the medical profession. So all the professions are now on an equal footing. All are bankrupt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The title of the Bill says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to simplify certain deeds relating to land and to provide as to the effect of certain other such deeds".</p></blockquote>
The surveyor's report is a deed relating to land. I agree with the hon. Member for Garscadden that it should be put in the Bill that building societies must accept that single surveyor's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now depart from the surveyors' profession and come to the issue of dud companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The title of the Bill is "Land Registration". There is no sense in putting in an amendment for a surveyor's report to go into something which is going to be lodged for all time, because clearly that surveyor's report would be worthless. I am not a lawyer, but even I can understand that. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will at least try to keep to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Doig. My hon. and learned Friend mentioned certain companies to which he wishes to
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
refer. I, too, referred to those companies. I suggest that it is very relevant to the Bill because there are companies, the ownership of which it is impossible to determine, purchasing land in Scotland today. Surely, that comes within the scope of a Second Reading debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a not a point of order, because I have never tried to stop that subject being discussed. I have never pulled anybody up for that so far. I am pulling hon. Members up for talking about things which are totally outside the scope of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your inability to understand my grasp of what is within this Bill, Mr. Doig, is equivalent to my inability ever to grasp conveyancing. Now perhaps the Committee is beginning to understand Professor Henry's difficulties and the reason for his seizure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of dud companies. I think it important that when a title is registered it should reflect an identifiable person who is in fact the real owner. Whether it be trustees or the directors of a company or institution who are named, the title ought properly to reflect—like the legend on a public house—the person who is responsible for that land. I should welcome an assurance that that will be a requirement under this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only right that, having been chastised so often for being irrelevant, I should now ensure that I am at least brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) at the beginning of our proceedings. We welcome the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of points about the details of implementation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
of the legislation which I should like the Minister either to comment upon this morning or to consider before Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the question whether the costs of conveyancing will be reduced, as a result of the Bill. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and some of my hon. Friends have discussed that matter. I wish to make clear what I feel ought to be the effect of this legislation. I think that my views will tie in fairly closely with what the Lord Advocate indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one can expect that those who buy and sell land or property will see a substantial reduction in conveyancing costs directly or immediately as a result of the Bill. However, I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that, taking the long view of the whole effect of this legislation and discounting the changes in the value of money and the effect of inflation over that long perioid, there is no doubt but that the process of making a conveyance will, on average, become considerably easier and quicker and therefore cheaper as a result of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that can be clearly set out, because I hope also that the passage of the Bill through Parliament—which I hope will be speedy—will be followed by, among other things, consultations between the Lord Advocate's Dept and the Law Society of Scotland about how, over a period of up to 30 years, we are to tackle the process of ensuring that there is some reflection of the fact that once each title is changed and put on the register there is undoubtedly a greater assurance for any solicitor or estate agent that the work involved in transfer will be easier, shorter and therefore, surely, somewhat cheaper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we do not expect great things and we do not expect big reductions, we want to be assured that this will not be forgotten, that everything will not go on merely as it has before but there will be some reflection of this measure, however small, to the benefit of those exchanging property or land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I ask a question about the speed of changeover. I entirely agree that the sensible way is to effect the changeover over a period and by sections of the country, as has been outlined in another place and also, to some extent, this morning. But it is important to know, as my hon. Friend asked this morning, whether it will be open to someone who
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
wishes to have his title brought up to date and put on the register, as it were, even though it may not be changing hands, to go to the Keeper and ask him to make the change with regard to his property. Will the Keeper be prepared to entertain such a request, subject, of course, to its feasibility from the point of view of the time it would take? This would be a way of smoothing out unevennesses in the work of the Keeper, and I should have thought that it would be to his advantage, too, if there could be steady progress, including more than just those properties which change hands from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is the question of indemnity. Under the Bill, as the Lord Advocate outlined, a person whose property has been put on the register, and therefore cleared for its previous history, will be able to get indemnity in future from public funds if there should be any dubiety or problem about it. But we might come to another aspect in Committee. If, after this process had been carried out, it should later appear that there was an error resulting from some misdemeanour or deliberate act of untruthfulness in the previous records prior to registration and this new oversight by the Keeper, would it be open to the public purse or the Keeper—whoever it be—to get damages from someone for a previous misdemeanour if it was found that it had led to an inaccurate title being registered? I do not think that that is likely to be a frequent occurrence, but it could occur and it may save a lot of litigation later if we make clear in Parliament how we think it ought to be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point, which was also raised by my hon. Friend, concerns the suggestion, which I think came from the Henry committee, that the initial cost of these changes—in some respects, an increased cost—could be repaid over a period by a modest due exacted in future years until the debt is paid off. What is the Government's view on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good deal of the debate has been very entertaining and has at times concentrated on some matters, Mr. Doig, which you have felt were not wholly relevant. I want to touch on only one aspect of the rest of the debate, namely, the proposal made specifically by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) and implied, if not actually made, in the remarks of the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). That proposal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
was that the register, once made up, should be used deliberately and clearly to enable anyone to build up a picture on demand or on request, however it may be done, of exactly who owns what, and where, all over Scotland. I think that it is relevant to ask whether the register is to be used for this purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the hon. Gentleman's objection to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. The proposal has been made, and it is important that we should be clear what the purpose of the register is and what sort of extension of it that proposal would entail. The purpose of the register is purely to establish over a period a firm title for the future on every property in Scotland. The register is not concerned with how a particular piece of property is used or managed. It has nothing to do with planning law which determines the use to which various pieces of land are put. It is designed purely to establish the title of the person or body who is the owner of a piece of land. The question of how land is managed or who is, in fact, the owner is very much a secondary matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not relevant to how land is managed whether the owner is a foreigner or not, an institution or not, or a company or not. What is relevant in that context is whether the landowner manages the land well and efficiently in the interests of those in the area and those who occupy it or whether he does not. The question of who he is is not important. That is where the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East does a tremendous disservice to us in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are indebted to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Selby) for bringing out what the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East was not prepared to say—that his real wish is to use the register to discover whether the owners of each particular property in Scotland are on the electoral register. That is what the S.N.P. land policy is about, and the hon. Gentleman was forced into admitting it by the hon. Member for Govan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to finish the point? I shall give way in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are thousands of people throughout the land who occupy homes, or in some
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
cases farms, who know very well that what matters to them is not the nationality of the owner or his tastes, habits or anything else but whether he is a good landlord, runs his affairs well and thinks about his tenants' responsibilities, needs and so forth. The desire of the S.N.P.—including the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East, as was clear from what he was forced to say this morning—is simply to put off, discourage and remove all those people who might come into Scotland and place investment here, whether in land, in industry or in other undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I say to the S.N.P. Members and their colleagues outside is that, before they rush into that crazy policy which would reduce inward investment to Scotland to a trickle, if it allowed any at all, they ought to look at the thousands of jobs which depend today upon inward investment by people who do not meet the criterion of the Scottish National Party, who are not on the register in Scotland and who are not, in its view, Scots citizens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman recovers his breath after that little peroration giving a very polished defence of land speculators, which is basically what he is doing. Is the hon. Gentleman repudiating the comments of his hon. and learned Friend and Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn), who made clear that he regarded it as an important part of its role that the register should be able to identify the beneficial owners of the land and whether one of these companies which buy land can be traced through so that we know who the owners are? Is the hon. Gentleman repudiating his hon. and learned Friend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just coming to that. I always seem to give way just when I am about to come to the point concerned. Let us establish first that what the hon. Gentleman has just said is perfectly clear. He is trying to discourage anyone from bringing inward investment into Scotland in any way he can unless that person is a citizen or is on the register in Scotland. That is a recipe for the destruction of thousands of jobs, and he must stand by that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's particular point about the ownership of companies, I do not in the least disagree with what my hon. and learned Friend said. The point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
is, surely, a good one. What we require to know and what the register must provide is who is the responsible person who carries authority with whom one can deal in matters affecting the property concerned on the register. That should be provided, and I hope that the Minister will confirm that that will be so. It would be useless as a register if one could not go to it and find out who was the responsible person who could make decisions, answer questions and take responsibility for them regarding a particular property. That, of course, is right, and I hope that the Minister will confirm that the register will contain that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good theory. I do not go all the way with the Scottish nationalists in what they are demanding, but may I draw the hon Gentleman's attention to the fact that, although what he put is a good theory, great difficulties arise in practice if there are absentee landlords. It is all very well to insist that the owner should be known, because often the property is not properly managed, but it is often very difficult to trace the owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to what is happening in London, where there are foreign owners of property and hundreds of tenants find it impossible to find out who the owners are in order that repairs, for example, can be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are again getting away from the Bill. The hon. Gentleman should confine his remarks to what is in the Bill and what it would be competent to put in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here we are concerned with the principle of the matter as regards Scotland, and we are not concerned with what happens in London. I agree that that does happen in many cases in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked into the matter over a considerable number of years, not just during the past week or two, and no one who deals with property—either lawyer or estate agent—has told me that he has ever had any ultimate difficulty in finding out who to deal with when wanting to buy or sell some land. Perhaps those to whom I have spoken may be wrong. Perhaps they are not representative. All I can say is that no one in the professions to whom I have spoken has ever had any difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often said, of course, in this
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Committee and in this House that one cannot find out who owns this or who owns that. All I can say is that those who have a professional reason for needing to find out tell me that they never have any difficulty. Whereas the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire may have difficulty from time to time in getting the information—I do not know why, but apparently he does—he does not necessarily have a right, unless he is professionally involved, to find out all this information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I give the hon. Gentleman an answer on one of the matters that he was worried about. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) has asked me to make the matter clear, because it may help the hon. Gentleman in his researches. He wanted to know why Mr. MacEwen could not unearth evidence of the ownership of the Hamilton family in Arran. The answer is that is that the family does not have any land in Arran. So it is not surprising that the hon. Gentleman could not find that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the trouble is that the hon. Gentleman was relying on figures which are some 50 to 100 years out of date. I only hope that his other researches are not quite so out of date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The information about the ownership of Arran or part of Arran by the Hamilton family was not taken from John MacEwen. It was taken from Tom Johnston's book on the history of Scots noble families, "Our Noble Families". It is a matter of historical fact that that was how the family got that land—by marriage of the great-great-great-great-grandmother of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated. I am glad to have been able to help the hon. Gentleman in a small way. I only hope that his researches in general are a little more up to date than 50 to 100 years old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all recognise that we have some small details to deal with in Committee, but in general this is a worthwhile measure which the Government are right to bring in, and the Opposition will give it every assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.29 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Harry Ewing)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am greatful to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
the Committee for the general welcome given to the Bill. I have promised that I shall not detain the Committee long, but I hope that in a few minutes I can deal with many, if not all, of the points that have been raised. Many of them were points for the Committee stage, but I think that the hon. Gentlemen who raised them are entitled to an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn, first, to the points raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), who apologised in advance for not being able to be with us during the closing speeches. He asked me five specific questions. First, he took up the reference in the other place to the 25 to 30-year period before the register would be fully operative. The reference meant precisely that. It was a reference to the fact that it is possible that it will be 25 to 30 years before the register is fully operative, in other words, before every property and title is fully registered. However, it is expected that 50 per cent., or more, of all the titles will be registered in the first 12 years. But the period of implementation, as distinct from the period of it being fully operative, is nine years. The two periods ought not to be confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pentlands asked also about the criteria to be employed to decide which area would derive the benefit of the Act first. The decision to introduce the new system in Renfrewshire was based against the background of the need to select what the hon. Member for Pentlands himself rightly described as a mixture of rural and urban area. Renfrewshire is a good example of such a mixture. It was for that reason that it was decided to select Renfrewshire. Having selected Renfrewshire, we feel that we shall gain tremendous experience in that rural and urban area with the initial registrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pentlands and his hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) raised the question of voluntary registration and the criterion that will be applied by the Keeper of the Registers in deciding whether to allow voluntary registration. The criterion will be the simple one that voluntary registration will be allowed in the area which is being dealt with at the time, in other words, in that year. Clearly, it would be impracticable, from staffing and other points of view, if, for example, someone in Ross and Cromarty wanted voluntarily to register a title when the area being dealt with was Renfrewshire. There could be no organisa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
tion of the registration procedures if the Keeper were to allow that. Basically, that simple criterion will be applied.

The question of State indemnity was raised by the hon. Members for Pentlands and for Ayr. Clause 32 deals with that. The hon. Member for Ayr is quite right to say that where mistakes appear in a registration and are discovered at a later date, people will be indemnified against that occurrence. The hon. Member for Pentlands raised the question of how the indemnity was to be funded. He asked whether it was to be funded by the setting up of a special fund or by money direct from Parliament. The answer is that it will be funded by money direct from Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last of the five important questions asked by the hon. Member for Pentlands was on the possibility of subsidising the earlier registrations, because as the system goes on—I shall return to this later—clearly, it will become cheaper. Therefore, those involved in the first registrations are in danger of having to pay a great deal more than those involved in later registrations. For that reason, the Government have decided to accept that the first registrations will be subsidised in order to protect those involved in the first registrations.

I turn now to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). I, too, enjoyed his speech. He described this Bill as a modest response. I say to my hon. Friend that it just shows what can be achieved. When the demands are modest, we can respond in a modest manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend and Member for West Stirlingshire and the hon. Member for Ayr mentioned of John MacEwen, who is known personally to me and is a man for whom I have great admiration. I think that it would be right for the Committee to place on record its appreciation of John MacEwen's work over a number of years as a forester in Scotland. Many of the well managed forestry estates in Scotland—some in private ownership—are very well managed and very good because of the work put in during John MacEwen's lifetime in forestry. I have heard landowners themselves pay tribute to his work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to appear patronising, but I feel that his book was not quite complete, because much of his research was done without the benefit of the Henry report.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
I suspect that the Henry report was out of print at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I notice that Her Majesty's Stationery Office has reprinted the Henry report lately, and has included the same old price of 12s. 6d. on the front page. I doubt that anyone would be asked by H.M.S.O. to pay 12s. 6d. for it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) asked about tenants-at-will and their ability to buy their tenancy. I think that I dealt with that matter in an intervention at the time. Clause 20 sets out a series of options, and we go on to qualify that by saving "whichever is the lesser".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the allocation of legal expenses—clause 20(5)—I am prepared to have a look at that matter because I recognise the importance of what the hon. Gentleman said. Basically, the approach taken to the question of the buyer—in other words, the tenants—paying the owner's legal costs is that the buyer gets the advantage in the sense that the buyer gets the title, whereas the seller, according to the approach that is taken, gets no advantage at all. The system which has been handed down through the years is that the buyer paid the owner's legal expenses, based on that approach. But, having said that, I want to qualify it by saying that I am prepared to have a look at the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come next to the question of the ability to obtain information about beneficial ownership. It is an important question. As the hon. Member for Ayr said, the Bill is about the registration of a legal title. It is not about beneficial ownership. This register, like the register of sasines, will be a public register and will be open for examination by anyone who wants to examine it. In that way it will be possible to build up a fund of information about the ownership of land through the registration of title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, particularly in the case of companies—where the title is registered, in all probability, in the name of the company—that that is not necessarily the same thing as disclosing the beneficial ownership. I do not back away from that. But the Bill is not about that issue. In order to discover the beneficial ownership, it would be necessary to go to the companies register, the register of sasines, as distinct from the register which we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
setting up. No one should decry the register of sasines. Research organisations, universities and so on throughout the world pay great tribute to the register of sasines and the way in which they can obtain information from that register which they cannot obtain in other parts of the world. So in setting up this new system we are not decrying the old system; we are merely modernising it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of beneficial ownership involves company law. Certainly, it is more company law than it is land registration. I think that all members of the Committee recognise the problem. I do not want to understate or overstate it. I am saying that we recognise the problem, but I am saying also that the Bill is not about the obtaining of information about beneficial ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has put the point fairly and clearly, but it would be a terrible shame if, in setting up a new system, we did not use the opportunity to try to get the maximum out of that system at the time we set it up. It would not require a great deal more to meet the points made by myself and by other members of the committee so that one could determine the beneficial owner on each sheet of the register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in great danger of straying out of order and into company law. Sometimes it is difficult for companies themselves to know who owns them in terms of shareholding. The question of company law is very complex. I agree with the hon. Gentleman's general proposition that it would be a pity if we did not obtain the maximum benefit from this legislation, but the legislation is about the registration of legal title and not about beneficial ownership, important as that question undoubtedly is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will confirm, I hope, that there will be no question of the register having to display racial origin of beneficial ownership. That is highly undesirable and quite out of order in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dealt extensively with the S.N.P. land policy when one of the matter day debates taken by the S.N.P. in the Grand Committee was on land policy. I am on record as deploring the fact that contained within the S.N.P. land policy is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
the qualification—which applies even to companies—that one must either be resident in Scotland or a Scot before one can own land, and that companies must have a majority of their board members who are Scots or resident in Scotland. The S.N.P. know my views on this matter. Certainly, there is no question of the register having to disclose the nationality of an owner. It would be a great pity if we were to wander into that sort of situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I take, first, the question of sub-divided villas. If such a question arises in the future with sales of a sub-divided villa, it will be necessary to make a registration for each part of the sub-divided villa and each registration will have to contain the information that is necessary to register the title to each part of the sub-divided villa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of conveyancing has greatly worried the Committee. We have talked to the Law Society about this. It has said that in years to come it will be possible to reduce the cost of conveyancing but, like us, the Law Society cannot at this stage put a particular percentage figure to it. No one could venture to put a percentage figure of cost reduction for conveyancing. But the Law Society has given us the assurance that, as the new system becomes more effective, it ought to be able to reduce the cost of conveyancing. I hope that I have been able to persuade the Committee on that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) raised the question of the relationship between this Bill and the crofting Acts. This Bill has no effect
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
on the recent crofting legislation since it does not affect crofting tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the speech of the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn). I am always interested in his contributions because he has a fund of experiences. We have recently emerged from the Committee on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, where the hon. and learned Gentleman made the confession that he was the only member of the Committee who had been birched. Here we are discussing the Land Registration Bill and the hon and learned Gentleman reveals that he is the only Member who has failed his conveyancing examination. Even I have not failed my conveyancing examination. I look forward with eager anticipation to being on the Committee that considers legislation dealing with the law of rape, because if I want to hear one confession, Mr. Doig, it is that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the Minister that I have never had to commit it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That convinces me of the hon. and learned Member's powers of persuasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I have covered all the points that have been raised. I took up the points raised by the hon. Member for Ayr as I went along because some of them were similar to points raised by other hon. Members. I am grateful to the Committee for the general welcome that has been given to the Bill, and we look forward to its speedy progress through Committee and onward to the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
