	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection (Mr. Robert Maclennan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Counter-Inflation (Price Code) Order 1978 (S.I. No. 1082).</p></blockquote>
The statutory instrument we are considering is brief arid simple, and I hope that I shall keep my remarks equally brief and simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it will be recalled that in the past we have had lengthy debates about previous versions of the price code ever since price codes were introduced following the Counter-Inflation Act introduced by the previous administration in 1973. I want firmly to emphasise that the price code we are considering today has virtually nothing to do with these earlier versions, either in content or in purpose. The reason for that is that the main purpose of the original price codes has now vanished. Their purpose was to seek to control prices and profit margins and, with the passage of the Price Commission Act last year, the need for a price code of that kind disappeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the obligation to retain a price code—not one setting out detailed rules to control prices or margins—remains in terms of the Counter-Inflation Act 1973 to give the commission guidance in the performance of its remaining rather limited duties under the Counter-Inflation Act. It is with that that we are concerned this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first purpose of the present instrument, and the price code order, is to revoke the previous version of the code which was devised for a function which has now expired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the 1977 order were not revoked, that code would, in principle, remain in force as a set of guidelines for industry to follow, even though, following the passage
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
of the Price Commission Act, it would be unenforceable. It is not the Government's intention that industry should be so guided by the principles of the old code. We have no desire that industry should adhere to that code on a voluntary basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The retention of the old code would clearly cause a great deal of confusion, and it is for these practical purposes, as well as the technical reasons for the present order revoking the 1977 code, which lead me to think that Parliament ought to approve this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be some puzzlement over why we have not taken the opportunity to abolish the price code entirely but replace it with another code, albeit one of the utmost simplicity. The reason for this, as I have mentioned, is that under the Counter-Inflation Act, although the main purposes of the old price control have departed, some less important functions remain, principally two. They are, first, to keep under continuous review any questions which may be referred to the commission by the Secretary of State. For example, the review of fresh food prices falls under that provision. The second function is the publication of information and advice. In practical terms, neither of these remaining functions under the Counter-Inflation Act is of great importance compared to their more recent functions under the Price Commission Act 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, we are under an obligation to give the Commission guidance, and we believe that both the simplest and most appropriate way of doing that is as we have done it in the order. It simply requires the Commission to have regard, in the performance of its functions under the Counter-Inflation Act, to the same general criteria which apply to its more important functions under section 2 of the Price Commission Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it will be apparent that the order is of extremely limited scope and significance. It represents no departure in policy; it has no implications for anyone other than the Price Commission. In fact, it can be regarded as the completion of the transition to the new system of prices policy which was embodied in last year's legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, perhaps, unfortunate that this measure should go under the description
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
of a price code at all, because of its radical differences from earlier price codes. This could, I think, though I am not aware that it has, give rise to some confusion. We have tried to minimise any misunderstanding in industry through our consultations, which, of course, we are obliged to have, with interested organisations before introducing the order in the summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is fair to say that there was widespread and general agreement that the method we have chosen of fulfilling our obligation to maintain a code for the guidance of the Commission has been the simplest solution to the technical problem. Therefore, I hope the Committee will find no difficulty in accepting this measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.37 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee understands fully the hon. Gentleman's case in saying that this is in large measure a tidying-up operation, an overflow from the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, and its endorsement—indeed, absorption—by the Price Commission Act 1977. But I think it would not be entirely right for this very modest opportunity to pass without comment upon the present position of Section 2 of the Price Commission Act 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister quite rightly drew us back initially to the Counter-Inflation Act 1973. I think it was under Section 6 of that Act that the Price Commission was set up to
	<br><blockquote><p>"exercise the powers conferred by this section in such ways as appear to them appropriate for the purpose of ensuring that the provisions of the code which concern prices and charges are implemented".</p></blockquote>
In other words, it was a directive at that time that these codes be issued for the specific purpose of influencing charges and prices. In a sense, that has not been entirely eliminated by the steady erosion of the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We naturally welcome, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the steady improvement in relaxation of the code principle, and I think none of us would be a willing party to the re-introduction of a codified system of price control. But the question that must still be in our minds is the extent to which, even by endorsing this very modest measure here today, there is still an element of the residual prices policy under the 1973 Act being carried forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
The Minister is quite right—there is not a requirement under this little measure to become involved in detailed implementation of price control. But, as the little order states, in Article 2(2),
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Price Commission, in performing their functions under the Counter-Inflation Act"—</p></blockquote>
that is the body of legislation to which we are referring today—
	<br><blockquote><p>"as amended, to have regard in accordance with subsection (1) of section 2 of the Price Commission Act 1977 "—</p></blockquote>
And it is that Act which now clearly provides the statuory framework within which the Price Commission has to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the question of the guidance now being offered, section 2 of the Price Commission Act makes it clear that it is the duty of the Commission, in performing any function—and that function is now the one of advice and continuous review, as the hon. Gentleman has stated —to have regard to certain specific matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Its first requirement is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to have regard to all matters which appear to the Commission in the particular circumstances to be relevant with a view to restraining prices of goods and charges … and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to have regard in particular to the matters mentioned in the following subsection so fall as the Commission consider them relevant."</p></blockquote>
Section 2, to which this modest code adjustment now strictly relates, is the heart of the Government's Price Commission Act and of the powers and the conditions under which those powers should be exercised. I suggest that it is relevant, therefore, that before accepting this modest amendment to the code, which relates the residual powers under the 1973 Act so clearly to Section 2 of the Price Commission Act 1977 the Committee should be aware of what it is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no particular axe to grind in relation to the order itself except insofar as it throws further weight upon Section 2 of the Price Commission Act 1977. There is a certain irony in that we are discussing Section 2 of the Price Commission Act 1977, insofar as the order relates directly to it, on the morrow of a major collapse of the Government's policy for wages and the influence on pay policy. The consequence could so easily
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
be that Section 2 becomes almost disproportionately important, because the Government are now in a position, in seeking their long-term objective, to restrain prices and charges, or even to keep under continuous review questions that may be referred by the Secretary of State concerning publication of information and advice on prices and charges. It is a fact that the Price Commission Act 1977, particularly Section 2, to which the order refers, contains the guts of the Government's power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first matter of substance which I feel is relevant to this debate is to invite the hon. Gentleman, if he wishes, to comment on how far it is the Government's intention to use more widely the powers under Section 2. We have now agreed that the residual counter-inflation powers are to be devolved into this section. We have equally agreed that the 1977 Act is the only real weapon that the Government have of a legislative kind to become involved with pricing policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I must express some considerable anxiety. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can dispel it by saying that it is not the Government's intention to use these powers more widely than they have been used in the recent past, despite the pressure upon them in economic management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Price Commission's powers rest on Section 2 but, having seen the Price Commission in action, whether it be in the matter of continuous review, or whether it be in the matter of having questions referred to it by the Secretary of State, as the order requires, or, indeed, in the matter of the publication of information and advice, we have not been shaken from our view that the Price Commission could be an extremely difficult partner for industry to take in hand. It is common knowledge that its investigations have caused considerable difficulty and much anxiety, and it is widely seen as an instrument of massive intervention. The circumstances which I describe as obtaining today might be an even greater pressure for further intervention of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reports that have been conducted and the activities of the Commission are ruled by section 2 of the Price Commission Act, to which the order refers. There have been .investigations into a number
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
of prices and into a number of markets —into batteries, TV rentals, tea, the bedding industry and so on—largely because the Price Commission's powers can be triggered off by price application procedure, the more recent being into Lever Brothers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the most recent report to come my way, which illustrates how section 2 can be used, causes me very grave anxiety. It is the commission's report into Royal Doulton tableware—an investigation into the increases in the prices of china, earthenware and ornamental items.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have decided that section 2 provides the ground rules for this investigation and, if the code is to mean anything at all, it must mean that the section 2 criteria of the Price Commission Act are even more relevant and, it is to be hoped, more strong than they were before. Therefore, I believe it is of interest to the Committee that it understands how the Price Commission interprets section 2 in relation to its investigations, because in the case on which the report was laid before the House—I believe it was on 19th October —the commission had regard to section 2 of the Price Commission Act and in particular, in its examination of the Royal Doulton chinaware company, to subsections (1)(a), (2)(a), (2)(c), (2)(e), and 2(h). Section 2(1)(a) of the Act provides that the Commission has,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to have regard to all matters which appear to the Commission in the particular circumstances to be relevant with a view to restraining prices ".</p></blockquote>
But, subsequently, the application from the Royal Doulton company for 93 per cent, was received, which was only a modest touch above the inflation rate of that time, and the commission allowed the company to obtain an interim adjustment to its prices of 7·3 per cent. Section 2 was here being operated as the trigger for the inquiry and yet, if the Price Commission had regard to all matters which appeared to be relevant with a view to restraining prices, it could not easily suddenly concede 7·3 per cent, out of the 9·3 per cent, claim that the company made. It then went on to say that subsection (2)(a) was relevant to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the need to recover costs … efficiently".</p></blockquote>
That is fair enough. That is what the price application;iwas;for originally. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
then suggested that subsection (2)(c) was relevant to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the need to earn, from selling goods and providing services in the United Kingdom, profits which provide a return on the capital".</p></blockquote>
If under the profit arrangements—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think the hon. Member is taking us rather wide of the subject matter of the statutory instrument before us. Reference is made there to the Counter-Inflation Act 1973 and the Price Commission Act 1977, but it is the Counter-Inflation (Price Code) relative to the statutory instrument to which the Committee is addressing itself, and my own feeling—although I have no expertise on the subject—is that the hon. Member is taking us a little wide of the instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your guidance, Mr. Jones. I am involved in article 2(2) of the order which relates the powers under the previous Counter-Inflation Act to section 2(2) of the Price Commission Act, and it is purely with section 2(2) that I wish to make the argument that if that section is to be interpreted by the Price Commission in the way in which it has interpreted it to date in specific cases that have come its way, then what the Committee is being asked to do is to endorse a further very dangerous step in the erosion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is using comparatives, as I understand matters, to seek guidance with regard to the use of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite accept the purpose, but I suggest that the hon. Member is taking us too wide of the issue and drawing too much on what has gone before. I am sure that the Minister will be able to answer the point made by the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my observations even more closely to the text of the order insofar as I accept that it comes under the Counter-Inflation Act and not under the Price Commission Act. But I wish to conclude this reference by stating that if, in the case of the evidence we have from recent inquiries, the Price Commission is to operate within section 2 in a manner which is clearly inconsistent with the objectives laid down in section 2, this order becomes a further absurdity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
The Opposition—and certainly industry—need from the Government a greater assurance that they will only advise the Price Commission. The very guts of this order is the advisory power of the Secretary of State to become involved in matters which really are significant either in relation to the Government's economic policy or to consumers at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that a massive inquiry into the prices and charges for fine china and earthenware comes into neither of those categories. I suggest further that using section 2 as a method of investigating a company with a 56 per cent, total export record, a company which has received the Queen's Award for exports and the Queen's Award for technical innovation, is a colossal waste of time, particularly when the price application which gave rise to the investigation was granted virtually totally during the interim period and totally at the conclusion of the investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Under-Secretary justify the activities of the Price Commission and giving it increased power, as this order is doing, unless he can satisfy us that its activities will be confined to areas of real significance to us as taxpayers and consumers? I believe that he should look somewhat more widely than the present series of reports to find that justification. It is for that reason that the Opposition will lose no opportunity of raising the issue of how the Price Commission operates within the terms of the Counter-Inflation Act. I can only conclude that there are many more jobs to be done at present in the British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ironic that the Commissioner involved in the inquiry into Royal Doulton tableware was largely involved as a union negotiator at Ford. On the one hand, he was trying to keep prices down, with Royal Doulton, and, on the other hand, he was trying to push up prices through negotiations at the Ford Motor Company. I do not know which of the two is more consistent with the Government's objectives, but I am sure that both can be made consistent. British industry wants to have greater encouragement to proceed and develop its products, expand its market, increase its profits, and reduce unemployment by providing -more jobs. Those are the activities to which the Commission might be able to bend its mind, instead of looking

around wistfully, like a bull, for another china shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.54 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by correcting the hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Shaw). He said that the order increased the powers of the Price Commission. It does no such thing. It would be quite wrong if that impression were given. It simply gives guidance to the Price Commission about how it should exercise its preexisting powers—powers which were given to it by a Conservative Government in 1973. In no way does the order extend the scope of those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not altogether surprised by the attitude of the Opposition spokesman. The hon. Member for Pudsey began by saying that this was a modest order. As usual, we are somewhat in the dark about the Opposition's attitude to price control generally. There are differences of emphasis between the hon. Member for Pudsey and the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mrs. Oppenheim), who sometimes speaks on these matters. The hon. Member for Gloucester used to speak of the operations to which the hon. Member referred this morning as the operations of a Star Chamber. The hon. Member for Pudsey spoke this morning of the Price Commission being an extremely difficult partner for industry. One can note a difference of emphasis between partnership and Star Chamber tyranny. I am glad to think that at least the hon. Gentleman sees some prospects for the Price Commission working in tandem with industry. This is very much in line with the Government's views.

The hon. Member spoke about how the Price Commission had operated its investigatory procedures under section 2 of the Price Commission Act, but I do not propose to follow him down that route. It has exercised its investigatory powers under the provisions of an Act with which we are not directly concerned. The code which we are introducing flows not from that Act but from die Conservative Government's Counter-Inflation Act. Very different considerations arise in respect of the very limited powers which remain to the Price Commission under that Act—the power to give advice and the power to maintain those matters under review which are referred to it by the Secretary

of State—from those which arise under the Price Commission Act. As I said, the powers are rarely used, and I see no reason to believe—though I would not preclude the possibility—that they are likely to be used as a scope for expansion, in any sense, of price control.

The vehicle for price control at this stage is the Price Commission Act. So, far from it having given rise to problems of the kind which the Opposition have never lost an opportunity to suggest might flow from it, I believe that it has exercised its powers very flexibly and effectively. Indeed, it has largely removed the anxieties which were originally felt in some sections of industry about its operations.

However, I have noted very carefully that the Opposition will lose no opportunity to raise the issue of how the Price Commission will exercise its powers in the future. I welcome that proposal. But the House has a right to know the attitude of the Opposition to this issue. Would they seek to cut down the powers of the Price Commission and limit the effectiveness of price control? Would they seek to amend or repeal the Price Commission Act? Even this morning the hon. Member did not make it wholly clear whether he thought that the Counter-Inflation Act itself, passed by the previous Government and from which this order stems, should be amended or repealed. It is in line with the Opposition's attitude to price control generally to snipe from the wings and to offer no constructive or clear view on which industry could rely about what they would do if they had the power.

I have presented this order as a modest measure, and I make no claim that it will provide any new armamentarium with which to tackle the problem of inflation. It is not presented in that light. It is a modest measure designed to assist the Price Commission in the exercise of its remaining and residual duties under the old Act and, as such, I think it is important in itself. More important, however, is that it also repeals the Price Code in all its elaboration, for which the hon. Member for Pudsey expressed his dislike, notwithstanding the fact that it emanated from the Conservative Government in 1973.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
