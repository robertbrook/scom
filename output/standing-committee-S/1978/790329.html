	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>FIREARMS (VARIATION OF FEES) ORDER (NORTHERN IRELAND) 1979</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee have considered the Firearms (Variation of Fees) Order (Northern Ireland) 1979.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tom Pendry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee gets under way, it might be helpful if I inform the Committee that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is taking steps with the Treasury to make the Firearms (Variation of Fees) (No. 2) Order (Northern Ireland) 1979, which will revoke the order which is due to be considered by this Committee. We take this step to allow the dust to settle following the House's decision last Thursday in relation to similar fees in England and Wales—and I might say, as an aside, that there has been a little more dust since last Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland are treated no less favourably than those in the rest of the United Kingdom. The effect of the Secretary of State's action will be to retain the existing fees in the meantime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to congratulate the Minister on what he has done this morning. In view of the decision taken by the House last Thursday, I believe that it would have been improper to have proceeded with this order. If he had proceeded this morning, I think he would have had a battle on his hands. As it is, he and the rest of us can save our powder for events which may take place in two weeks' time. I am grateful to the Minister and welcome his decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wm. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Government's decision and thank them very much. I am sure that the Government recognise that the House is unhappy with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
the present system of fees, and I think that they also realise that the House, especially those honourable Members who are interested in firearms and shooting, are unhappy with the whole procedure relating to firearms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that after the next election the incoming Administration will not try to recoup the money next year but, that long before that, we shall have moved away from the present philosophy behind the charging of firearms fees, which I believe is totally wrong. I have stated my views on this matter on many occasions. I trust that some of the views expressed by Conservative Members on the Scottish variation of fees order will not be followed if the Conservatives should form the next Administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it be possible, or indeed in order, when the Government lay a number 2 order for Northern Ireland, for the Minister to seek to ask his right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland to lay a similar order for Scotland? The Scottish order was approved in a Statutory Instruments Committee, and this means that Scotland will now be the odd man out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I gather that the order under negative procedure expires today, no doubt it will be possible to lay a new order immediately to bring the Scottish position in line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer the honourable Gentleman positively, but I am sure that the Scottish Office is well aware of this meeting this morning and of the decision taken by Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Kiifedder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to thank the Minister for his decision this morning. I welcome his honeyed words—which, unfortunately, one does not hear all that often—to the effect that Northern Ireland should not be less well off than the rest of England and Wales. I think that this decision was inevitable following Thursday night's decision, but Governments have a tendency to go against opinion, and I think that it is right to express one's gratitude to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and to the Minister who has dealt with the matter in this Committee today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
