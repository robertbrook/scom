	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT AVIATION SECURITY FUND (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS 1979</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Aviation Security Fund (Amendment) Regulations 1979.</p></blockquote>
The regulations amend the Aviation Security Fund Regulations 1978, which implemented in detail sections 1 and 2 of the Civil Aviation Act 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that section 1 of that Act sets up the Aviation Security Fund, out of which the Secretary of State may make payments reimbursing the costs of security measures falling to be made under the Protection of Aircraft Act 1973 and the Policing of Airports Act 1974. Section 2 empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring aerodrome authorities to make contributions to the Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debated the Bill some time ago, considerable emphasis was placed on the need for widespread consultation, which I naturally accepted. Indeed, I gave various commitments on that, and I believe that I have faithfully met those commitments. The consultation process with the industry has been helpful. It has been a continuing process, and it will go on. In regard to these amending regulations, my officials have consulted very widely with the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was anxious that Members of Parliament should also be kept fully in the picture. In order to achieve that objective, I sent copies of a consultation paper prepared by my officials to the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) and to the hon. Members for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) and Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop), all of whom had been on the Committee, and also to my hon. Friend the Member for Feltham and Heston (Mr. Kerr). I offered to dis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
cuss the proposed amendments with them if they wished. In fact, there have been no further discussions. When I knew who the members of this Committee were, I sent them the consultation paper, which I had also put in the Library of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add in this connection that my officials have, of course, had consultations with representatives of the air transport industry about the consultation document and its contents. I have been guided in laying these amendment regulations by the results of those consultations. The Committee may find it helpful if I deal briefly with the proposed amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first two amendments and the fifth amendment are required simply to bring up to date the Aviation Security Fund Regulations 1978. The first two refer to the definition of an aerodrome. We have to keep the regulations as up to date as possible and the amendment of the two dates referred to achieves that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third amendment is the substantial one. It amends the existing sum of 80p to the new sum of 85p. The forecast outturn of expenditure from the Aviation Security Fund in the current year is just over £19 million, which is some £275,000 higher than the figure estimated when the levy rate for the current year was decided. That, too, of course, featured significantly in our debates. The estimated expenditure for next year is just over £24 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that the fund will show a surplus of £1,115,000 in the current year. That is due to a higher growth rate than was originally predicted. There has been a substantial increase in the number of passengers carried during that period. This surplus has obviously, and I think justifiably, been taken into account in arriving at the levy rate of 85p for next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deciding to propose the fourth change to the 1978 regulations, I was impressed by the arguments of operators of helicopters who were concerned about the apparent unfairness of the levy arrangements to them. The security measures which apply to oil rig helicopters emanating from the Protection of Aircraft Act 1973 are very small in relation to the general security arrangements required by the oil industry and the Department of Energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Helicopter operators are faced with substantial expenditure on security in that respect, and enjoy little or no reimbursement from the Aviation Security Fund in respect of measures recommended by my Department. Other representatives of the industry were sympathetic, and agreed that the weight limit of 5 tonnes for the exemption of passengers arriving in small aircraft in regulation 2E of the 1978 regulations should be raised to 10 tonnes to overcome this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fifth change is necessary to remove the words which were put into the 1978 regulations merely to allow retrospection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the discussions in Committee last year, the hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) was concerned about the effect of those regulations on certain transit passengers. My officials discussed this point fully with the representatives of the industry, who included representatives of the airports, the airlines, the travel trade and the airline users, and they were unanimous in their view that no amendment should be made. I wrote to the hon. Member setting out the arguments put forward and offering to discuss the issue with him if he wished. He has not indicated that he wishes to discuss them, and I assume from that that he is now satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to say that the regulations currently in force have worked out very well indeed. Both I and my officials have had the fullest co-operation from the industry, with the result that we have been able to resolve a number of problems which emerged during the course of the year, including insurance cover for aerodrome authorities against liability which might arise from security measures, the planned introduction of x-rays on a widespread basis at our principal airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful indeed for the help which the industry has given on the estimating of expenditure and traffic growth and for its co-operation in ensuring that the fund arrangements have worked out so satisfactorily. Indeed, we have even been able to reduce the extra staff involved by one, which is a 50 per cent, drop in our original estimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that this process has to go on at all, but the need for searching is a continuing need, regrettably, and perhaps one day the hopes that were expressed by
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the noble lord, Lord Trefgarne, in a debate in the House of Lords yesterday, will be achieved, namely, that searching will not be rendered necessary. But I fear that that is in the far distant future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.38 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I think it right to thank the Minister for his courtesy in the drawing up of these regulations. As this looks like being an annual event, I hope that it will be one that we will continue to conduct with the same degree of courtesy as the Minister has extended so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne last night looked forward to the day when we would not require these searching procedures, and I am sure we all do. It will probably be the same day that we need neither an incomes policy nor any argument about it. No doubt, too, all these other great events will happen—possibly even a national Government under the prime ministership of some distinguished Liberal—on the same day, I would think. But I do not regard any such events as being in the foreseeable future. Of course, if such a day ever did arise, I am sure that the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) would be the favourite candidate. However, I must be a little more serious and rapidly return to the realities as opposed to these fantasies which one enjoys from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, there are only two substantial changes. One is to increase the levy from 80p to 85p. There we must sadly observe that we have not yet overcome the problems of inflation. To go from 80p to only 85p is perhaps not too bad in these days. As the hon. Gentleman said, the increase in business, in throughput of passengers—what a ghastly term that is, but it is the "in" phrase, so I suppose we have to use it—has helped to maintain the unit cost at such a reasonable level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other change, from 5,000 kg. to 10,000 kg. in the maximum weight of aircraft which are exempted, is completely welcome. The Minister will recollect that, during the earlier stages of this legislation, we asked for a higher weight than 5,000 kg. We did not ask for it to be increased quite as high as 10,000 kg, so we are extremely pleased that he has felt able to go to that weight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The other thing on which I should like to comment is the difficulty which potentially arises for the British Airports Authority. I realise that nothing can be done about it at the moment, but it is something of which we should be aware. About a quarter of the British Airports Authority's staff is now concerned with security. That seems a lopsided arrangement. It holds some hazards for the future. It has imposed a substantial extra burden upon the authority, particularly upon its senior staff in coping with this and taking the full responsibility for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it will be recognised by the Government, and, indeed, by everybody concerned in the business, that the BAA has taken on a substantial extra load, whereby a quarter of its staff have to be integrated into pension schemes—I am not sure whether the BAA scheme is inflation-proofed—and who, one hopes, may at some time be redundant. We have to recognise that potentially there are problems there. But I do not differ with the Minister in what he has said about the need of the regulations, and we do not seek to oppose them in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.42 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that there is an upsurge of optimism in the Conservative Party in that it now looks forward to the millenium when we have a Liberal Government and all our troubles are at an end. I must congratulate the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) on this important contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, thank the Minister for his courtesy over these regulations. It is, however, important that we should not get into the habit of assuming simply that the searches at airports must go on forever. The hon. Member for Chingford has mentioned that the incomes policy seems now to be embedded in the British way of life, but I have on previous occasions mentioned that we still search the vaults beneath this building because somebody attempted to blow it up well over 300 years ago. It is a genuine fear in my mind that we shall accept that searching must go on at airports and that it must become more expensive. With such acceptance it will become not only a vested interest but a quaint old custom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also very important that we should not always accept that the easy way out
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
is to put up a levy. That is all too apt to happen. I should like some assurance from the Minister that he is constantly examining ways in which greater economy can be enforced, and that he is also considering that some airports, classes of passenger or both might be exempted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We went all through this when the Bill was debated and it would be out of order to do it again. But I sent the Minister some suggestions from the staff at Sum-burgh airport, who are engaged on all these matters, and he wrote me a courteous reply. Suggestions are being made which might achieve economy, and I hope that they are kept well in mind by his Ministry and that we can be assured that we shall not simply be asked to put up the price every few months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.44 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Churchill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to join in thanking the Under-Secretary of State for his courtesy in sending the members of the Committee the most helpful briefing note. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit), I welcome the 10 tonne exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate how far these 85p per passenger charges compare with those of our leading partners in aviation. For example, what charge does the United States make at Kennedy or Dulles airports? Could he also say how many security personnel are now on the payroll and what is the ratio for BAA airports of security personnel per thousand passengers using the airport?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am inclined to believe, from my own observations, that there is no set of airports in the world more heavily overmanned in the area of security than those of the British Airports Authority. There are armies of security personnel either hanging about waiting for aircraft, spending much of their day doing very little, or there is a massive backlog for them to cope with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why have we been so backward in moving to x-ray machines? There can hardly be a leading country anywhere in the world that has espoused x-ray machines with less enthusiasm and less rapidity than our own. Perhaps the Minister will tell us that there are grave defects in these x-ray machines, that they are not sufficient and that it is essential to turf everybody's baggage inside out.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
My impression is that people do not mind security, but they do not appreciate unnecessary security, the delays that go with it and the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that at Heathrow and other airports there is far too great a reliance on manual searching, which, I should be inclined to believe, from a non-expert viewpoint, is less efficient and less effective than x-ray. I hope the Minister will say something about the rapidity with which he intends to move to x-ray machines. Certain foreign airlines have been trying to put into operation x-ray machines which they have paid for and which they have brought in to this country, but there have been lengthy delays as a result of the BAA dragging its feet about the acceptance of this equipment and its operation, even though the same equipment is in operation in hundreds of airports in the United States and elsewhere in the western world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe it is necessary to await the millenium referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford before considering that a very high proportion, possibly the bulk of these security personnel will have to be made redundant because machines do the job much more efficiently. It would be a great mistake to accept that we must have an expanding force every year, although we accept that the Minister has dropped one of his strength of administrators and we are grateful for very small mercies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst I feel that we go heavily overboard in manual searching and the personnel required for it, at the same time there are grotesque gaps in the security of certain of our major airports. It is not my intention to say publicly which of the major airports I am referring to, but I should be happy to supply the information to the Minister, as I have already done to the police concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one of our major airports it is possible for people to drive on a main road within 50m to 100m of the place where the aircraft line up for take-off. There is no barrier whatever between that road and the run-up point or the take-off point. There is only one single guards—who, I suspect, is unarmed and is there in a communications role—who sits there looking at this stretch of tarmac. It would take no more than five seconds for a car or group of cars to race across that
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
tarmac and shoot up any airliner that was at the take-off point. It is the excesses of security coupled with these grotesque inadequacies which need a serious rethink by the BAA, and I very much hope that the Minister will undertake to look at them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.50 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members for the constructive attitude they have taken to the amending regulations. One of the points of substance has been the numbers of staff employed in the job of security at our airports at present. The hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) is right in saying that the senior staff of the British Airports Authority have had to accept a very heavy burden. They have done so willingly and with considerable distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the arguments of the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Churchill), I think the job that is being undertaken by our security staff has been accompanied by higher standards, and higher standards of training, too, than was the case before. The burden has been increasing because of the increasing numbers of passengers using our airports, which has naturally made necessary even more diligence and care on the part of the searching staff. I shall deal with the question of numbers in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) dwelt upon the possibilities of the future. I only wish that we shall in future find that, as a result of some peccadillo on the part of British Ministers, we are merely preserving a custom and in reality the whole threat has been removed, but I fear that that is not to be the case. But I can give the right hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance that we intend to keep a constant watch on questions of economy. If people wish to make contributions to our thinking on these matters, we will gratefully receive them and give them every possible consideration. The same applies to exemptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stretford raised specific points. He asked how the charges compare with those in the United States. I think I am entitled to ask for notice of that question. I will try to find out for him what the position is, but it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
very dangerous to apply direct comparisons, because the situations are different. The basis of the charges is quite different, and the situation in Europe is different from that in the United States as a whole. But I think that implicit in the question was the suggestion that charges are much lower in the United States than here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answering the question, we must ask ourselves whether the standards are comparable. Do we apply higher standards here and, if so, are we justified in doing so? Is there any element of cosmetic searching in the United States? Is the searching to rapid in certain instances, as a result of the use of x-ray machines? The hon. Gentleman is very familiar with the United States, and I do not think he will dissent when I say that I have observed certain deficiencies in that regard in the United States. But it would be quite unfair to make a blanket charge of that kind, and in any case my personal experience in that regard is not sufficient to enable me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About the use of x-ray machines I have no preconceived prejudices. I think that there is a tendency with the use of x-ray machines to exercise too short a view—to cut corners a bit—and this is not helpful to effective security. Therefore, I believe that we need a balance. The use of x-ray machines is desirable; certainly they create less inconvenience, particularly at certain times of the year, such as Christmas, when it is a real chore and nuisance to be put to the inconvenience of opening carefully-wrapped Christmas parcels and the like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have also to recognise that manual searching is probably more secure—I do not entirely go along with the hon. Gentleman—but I believe that the one can buttress the other, and that is the approach that we seek to achieve. Indeed, before the fund the position was that x-ray devices would only be installed at the expense of the Department where it was accompanied by prospects of staff savings sufficient to justify the capital expenditure on the devices. Not. altogether unexpectedly, under those conditions only five devices were installed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in establishing the fund we have had detailed consultation with the industry, and it was agreed that over the next two years about 1½ million will be set aside for the provision of devices
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
at the expense of the fund and, indeed, the National Aviation Security Committee made recommendations about this in July 1978. I gather that the British Airports Authority is currently considering carrying out a number of tests on certain devices and will shortly be putting its proposals to the Department. My own officials have had widespread consultations on this as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, airlines are free to instal devices at their own expense if that is what they want for the improvement of the conditions of their passengers. I understand that Braniff provided such a device at Gatwick but that it was unsatisfactory and is now unserviceable. To sum up the matter, we and the BAA hope that there will be many more devices in use at Heathrow, Gatwick and, possibly at other airports in the not too distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will write to me about these grotesque gaps in security. Of course, one cannot get 100 per cent, security, particularly as far as the periphery of large airports is concerned. It is a very difficult thing to achieve, but if the hon. Gentleman feels that matters which are capable of remedy should be brought to my attention, I shall certainly be grateful to hear of them. I understand why he has not named specific cases today, and I do not in any way castigate him for tha(t because [believe that for him to have done so would have been highly counter-productive.

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
This morning we are to consider an important step in British Aerospace's entry into Airbus Industrie. The Committee is invited to consider a draft order under section 45 of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977. The order specifies that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State may make available up to £50 million assistance to British Aerospace under section 45. This is, of course, the maximum amount provided for in the section. The House will be invited in due course to approve a supplementary estimate for the payment of the £50 million. This is the first time use is to be made of section 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the guidance of the Committee I wish to say a few words about the structure of Airbus Industrie. It is a consortium of airframe manufacturers from four European countries, including the United Kingdom, acting together in a risk-sharing partnership to supply the central Airbus organisation with airframe components. These components are assembled in Blagnac, near Toulouse, into Airbuses. The sales of the Airbus are directed from the central organisation, and this also acts as a single contact point for airline companies for service requirements, spares and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to 1979 the full members of the Airbus Industrie organisation were Aerospatiale of France, with a 47·9 per cent, share, Deutsche Airbus of Germany, also with a 47·9 per cent, share, and CASA of Spain, with a much smaller 4·2 per cent, share. These shares defined the relative financial obligations of the members with regard to Airbus Industrie's costs. The operations of Airbus Industrie are controlled through a supervisory board. British Aerospace was previously represented on this board, but only as an observer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will be aware, these companies are not the only manufacturers involved in the Airbus. The Dutch-German manufacturer, Fokker-VFW, is also involved as producer of control surfaces on the wings. Another major participating manufacturer is, of course, the American General Electric Company, which produces the CF6-50 engine for the Airbus. But these are not full partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, the Airbus Industrie organisation has only one product—the Air-
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
bus A300. Further developments of that Airbus are in progress. However, the most important future product is the new smaller A310 Airbus, of around 230 seats. This is also to be available in two range variants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of last year there were over 180 orders and options for different versions of the A300, and 1978 was a particularly good year for the Airbus. At the Farnborough air show last year Airbus Industrie reported that it had sold 37 per cent, of all wide-bodied aircraft sold up to that time in 1978. For the future the total market requirement for these categories of aircraft, that is medium range wide body aircraft, could be as much as 1,500 units by 1990, and we expect the Airbus family to make substantial inroads into this sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the prospect of the new A310 Airbus that led to the recent proposals for the change of status of British Aerospace from a sub-contractor to a full partner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure hon. Members will understand, there were detailed and complex matters concerning manufacture and financing of the Airbus components which needed to be looked at, together with the role and status of British Aerospace as a partner in the Airbus Industrie organisation. These were matters for the industrialists—that is, British Aerospace, Aerospatiale and Deutsche Airbus. A agreement was reached last August, subject to the approval of the Governments concerned. In due course the agreement was signed on 29 November last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will realise, I am sure, that the details of this agreement are essentially a matter for British Aerospace. The main points in the agreement are as follows. First, it provides for British Aerospace to become a full member of Airbus Industries from 1 January 1979, with a 20 per cent, share and appropriate representation on the supervisory board. Secondly, the agreement provides for changes in the voting arrangements of Airbus Industrie so that major decisions require more than an 80 per cent, majority. Thirdly, there is to be continued participation by British Aerospace in the A300 programme and a substantial share in the A310 and other future programmes. Fourthly—there has been much discusison on this—along with the other parties to the agreement, British
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Aerospace has agreed not to participate in competing aircraft programmes without the agreement of the other parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The full voting rights that I have mentioned apply for British Aerospace immediately to the A310 project and to questions common to the A300 programme and the A310 programme. However, for a transitional period up to the delivery of the 150th A300 aircraft, or at the very latest by 1 August 1981, the present 75 per cent, majority rule will continue to apply. But it will apply only to questions specifically related to the development of the A300 M2/B4 programme. Additionally, it should be noted that this 75 per cent, rule will apply during the transitional phase only to those situations in which the A300 is in competition with aircraft fitted with British engines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The French and German partners have indicated that if British Airways should place an order with Airbus Industries, the "80 per cent, rule" would immediately take full effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be realised that all of these decisions are taken as part of a consultative process, with a lot of discussion and mutual agreement among the partners and sub-contractors. We feel that this is the most sensible way for an industrial concern such as Airbus Industrie to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governments are, of course, involved in all this. This stems from the financial backing provided by European Governments regarding the discharge of the manufacturers' obligations to Airbus Industrie—for example, concerning the development and production expenditure associated with the new aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With British Aerospace's entry into Airbus Industrie, the United Kingdom Government is now a party to these arrangements and is represented on the intergovernmental committee. The document setting out the principles of this co-operation between the Governments is available in the Library of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will realise that the entry of British Aerospace into Airbus Industrie is a very significant step forward for the aircraft industry in Europe. Opposition Members will know even better than I that the giants of the aircraft industry are
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
currently on the other side of the Atlantic. They have 90 per cent, of the Western world's market. I believe that Europe is capable of winning a fair share of this market for her products. The United Kingdom aerospace industry is certainly the largest in Europe. I believe that by joining with our European colleagues, we shall form one of the largest and most effective industrial groups in the civil airliner market to take us into the 1980s and 1990s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most immediately, for British Aerospace, the agreement reached will enable it to confirm its position regarding the production of A300 wings and, just as importantly, achieve a substantial share of the new A310 Airbus. For this, the workers in British Aerospace have already paid tribute. It means, of course, that the current employment of 2,000 or so on the Airbus work will be expanded. There will also be an opportunity for British equipment suppliers. I see no reason why they, too, should not be just as successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that British Aerospace has a soundly-based financial record. Its first set of accounts show increased sales, increased exports and increased profits reaching £65 million in 1977. The order book since British Aerospace came into being has increased by around £1,000 million and is still rising. The Government are determined that British Aerospace's position among the world's leaders shall be maintained. We are therefore ready and willing to make available the funds necessary for the heavy investment to which British Aerospace is committed as a result of joining Airbus Industrie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Aerospace's membership of Airbus Industrie will require additional investment to finance work already in hand on the A300 programme and for work on the new A310 Airbus. British Aerospace estimates that by 1983 it will need to invest a further £250 million at 1978 prices. We believe that this is not an opportunity we can afford to let slip through our fingers. That is why we decided to agree to British Aerospace's request for assistance in order to improve the immediate return on its investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the order is approved, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State proposes to make available £50 million under section
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
45 to British Aerospace in connection with its membership of Airbus Industrie. The money will be paid when the necessary Supplementary Estimate has been approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Aerospace is satisfied that, taking account of this assistance and of the wider commercial and industrial benefits, the prospective return on its own much more substantial investment in Airbus Industrie is adequate. It is intended that the money should be paid initially as a grant, but this will be subject to two important conditions. First, the dividends which British Aerospace pay on public dividend capital may be increased if membership of Airbus Industrie proves to be sufficiently remunerative. British Aerospace has already accepted this. Secondly, my right hon. Friend will have the right, after consulting the corporation, to convert the £50 million assistance wholly or partly into loan, or public dividend capital, or a mixture of the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members can be assured that through our providing the money in this way the necessary financial resources for joining Airbus Industrie are thus available to the corporation. At the same time, the Government will be able to maintain, through the setting of appropriate financial targets, the necessary degree of financial discipline over the whole field of British Aerospace's operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that to do this for British Aerospace will help to consolidate the airframe side of the European aircraft industry, and that it is not only in the national interest but is consistent with financial objectives if we assist by providing £50 million in this way. There is no doubt that the conditions necessary for the payment to be made under section 45 are met and can be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intended to make the money available to British Aerospace before the end of the current fiscal year. To enable this to be done the corporation's cash limit which was previously set for 1978–79 has been changed. The new limit is £62 million, compared with the original limit of £12 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When British Aerospace's cash limit was set, the Government did not, of course, know what new aircraft projects, if any, the corporation would be undertaking during the year. The Public Ex-
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
penditure White Paper published in January last year explained that British Aerospace's forecasts projected the requirements for external finance of the vesting companies based on a consolidation of their current business. The figures also included a broad allowance for expenditure on possible new projects, but this did not reflect any commitment to particular projects, or to a particular scale of financing or activity. The cash limit was determined on the basis of these forecasts, and it was always acknowledged that it might have to be exceeded if major project decisions were taken. We recognise that this is a significant and major step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a market which is estimated to be worth around $100 billion by the end of the next decade. With that in mind I hope that the Committee will be able to consider this draft order favourably, give it the support which I think it deserves and help to bring this chapter of the Airbus story to a satisfactory conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.12 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Pattie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister started by describing the requirements and the money to be allocated. When my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) and I discussed this matter yesterday we reckoned that there would not be many problems this morning. However, the more the Minister went on with his speech, the more questions began to arise, so we may regretfully have to prolong the proceedings more than would otherwise have been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was reading yesterday the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the relevant debate in Standing Committee. It will be its third anniversary in six weeks' time. We dealt with clause 45 on 30 March 1976. It was appreciated then that the clause would take over the launching aid of the Civil Aviation Act 1949 and that it would by no means be the sole source of finance for British Aerospace. Section 11 of the Act provides precise limits on borrowing and public dividends capital. There is also the possibility, we hear from the board, of internally generated funds. No one on the Conservative Benches assumes that what we are discussing is the only source of money for the future. I say that in case the Minister thinks we have stepped into that small trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
The Minister told us that this money is all for the Airbus project and that, for example, the cash limit will be varied as close to the end of the financial year as we are now. This must call in question, if not vitiate altogether, the purpose of the cash limit and cause us to wonder. The Minister offered certain reasons why British Aerospace had not put forward other, more expanded plans. Its cash limit was to be £12 million, but that has now had to be increased to £62 million within only a few weeks of the end of the financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know of the importance of the Airbus project. It would probably be churlish of me to say that the voting rights agreement and the whole deal that has been arranged on a Government-to-Government basis is not the best that could be obtained, particularly bearing in mind the nature and inclinations of some of the partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a question in my mind about full voting rights. I think there has been a great desire on the part of the French to get us into this project and that matter could have been pressed a little harder, as is indicated by the fact that the 80 per cent, majority rule is to come into effect as soon as British Airways places an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What struck me as rather extraordinary was the purpose for which the money is to be used. We are considering the draft British Aerospace (Design, Development and Production of Civil Aircraft) (Payments) Order, whereas we seem to be discussing an entry fee for joining the Airbus consortium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that British Aerospace reckons that by 1983 a further £250 million will be required—I think the Minister said at 1977 prices—and we are obviously talking about real sums of money. If we have exhausted the provision under section 45(5)—which we are effectively doing this morning if the order is approved—we are up to the limit. That is the entry fee gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The really big money starts to be required in later years. Although I repeat that we are not expecting section 45 to generate the funds, one wonders whether British Aerospace and the Department have really considered not only the Airbus opportunities—the Minister made
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
vague reference to the market opportunities that may occur in the 160- to 180-seater segment, which will probably be even greater than the 310-seater segment—but the 146, for which an order is still awaited. It will probably require, in round figures, £300 million to launch it by 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the Jetstream development. There are possibilities of further developments on the 748, the 125 and even very early developments on the next generation of SST.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it rather disturbing and disappointing not that we are going into Airbus—we on this side of the Committee have no problems about entry into that consortium—but that there seems to be no indication of a further assessment of the kind of global sums that will be needed to make British Aerospace function properly in future. Even at a reasonably conservative estimate, we are talking about £700 million required in the next few years, to say nothing of Rolls-Royce. It all has to come out of the same pot. Rolls-Royce is quite fond of telling us that the cost of a new engine development is pro rata, say, £350 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some very large sums of money will be required in future. This morning we are being asked to approve, up to the maximum, once and for all, what is virtually the entry fee. I cannot see whether this will cover existing production costs or whether it is just what we are to be relieved of for the privilege of going in, getting our 20 per cent, share and not having the best possible majority voting rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Minister would expect us to approve this order on the nod. We certainly look forward to further elucidation on these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.19 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Chertsey and Walton (Mr. Pattie) has raised some important questions. We should certainly not want to prevent the orders from being passed, because to do so would be to cripple British Aerospace's programme of entering the Airbus consortium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult for us to judge whether the Airbus consortium will be a profitable business for British Aerospace. We simply do not have access to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
the figures which we would need to make any judgment on that matter. But at this stage to rule out entry would seem to us to be wrong. At this stage we must to a considerable extent trust in the judgment of the board of British Aerospace, and we have to put some trust in the judgment of the Ministers who have been approached by British Aerospace for financial backing for this project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am rather worried by the way in which the Minister advanced his case. I understand that the money will initially be a grant but that it may perhaps be turned into something else later or that the fact that it has been made may at some time affect the dividend payable on the public dividend capital. That statement seems to me to denote a certain lack of confidence on the part of the Government and British Aerospace as to whether they will secure a return on this investment. If there were confidence that the programme would be profitable and that the money would show a return, one might have expected that they would have been happy to have £50 million as public dividend capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot quite see why the Minister has confused the issue of the ultimate designation of the £50 million. At one stage he used the phrase "if the A310 programme is sufficiently remunerative ". Sufficiently remunerative for what? What is " sufficiently remunerative "? What are the standards in this matter? We infer that there is no real confidence in British Aerosnace or in the minds of Ministers that the A310 programme will be profitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that workers had paid tribute—I think that was his expression—to those who got us into this programme. But what worries me is whether taxpayers will have to pay tribute for long afterwards as a result of it. As an enthusiast for the aerospace industry, I have always regarded it as one which is supposed to make profits, not one which exists to provide occupational therapy for people who would like to make aeroplanes. We must make up our minds whether British Aerospace is to be a profitable business, able to raise money on commercial terms, or an occupational therapy outfit. I very much hope it will be the former. I think that the Minister hopes so too, but he did not show very much confidence in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I understood the Minister to say—perhaps he will check for me what he said—that there was a $100 billion market. Such figures are designed to dazzle the mind the public. The sum of $100 billion sounds like an awful lot of money. It sounds like an awful big market. Did the Minister mean that the market for the A310 was $100 billion? Did he mean that the market for aeroplanes of that size was £100 billion? Or did he mean that the market for aeroplanes such as 747s, DC10s, TriStars, 767s, 757s, 777s, Jet-streams, old Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all was $100 billion? If that is what he meant, it is a somewhat irrelevant comment when we are discussing £50 million for the specific programme of the A310, which is only a tiny corner of the overall market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been much more helpful if the Minister had said " The market for aeroplanes of the A310 size is seen as such and such, and I am confident, on the advice I have received, that the A310 can expect to achieve X per cent, of it." Then we should have some idea of what market we are in. We all have some idea of its size, but I hope the Minister will tell us what size he thinks it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the fact that the corporation will not rely solely upon section 45 for its funding. That is just as well. As he said, we would guess at a requirement of about £700 million over five years of new capital investment. I understand that there is some suggestion that the corporation can internally generate about half of that sum. I do not know whether these are the sorts of figures which the Minister has in mind. It would be most helpful if he could tell us. Perhaps he could suggest which of the programmes will generate internally British Aerospace's own contribution to the cash required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The A300 wing sub-contract programme, I understand, is extremely profitable. But it is only of £200 million value in total, so even if it is substantially profitable it will not be able to provide much new capital. The 1–11 programme will not contribute a great deal of new capital in terms of profits. After all, it is a relatively small programme. No doubt the 748 is profitable, but it is quite small, as is the 125. Profits from the 125
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
will be more than taken up by the £11 million needed to invest in the proposed new Jetstream, so that will not contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where will all this money come from internally? Does the Minister expect that profits on the military contracts—particularly sales to those regimes which are not too popular, in the Oman and places like that, as well as the sale of Jaguars to India and perhaps the sale of Harriers to China—will produce sufficient cash?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other civil programme is the 146. I have here a brochure produced by British Aerospace a little while ago in which there is an extremely interesting diagram headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Financial assessment over 350 sales—Sensitivity to price and exchange rate".</p></blockquote>
It shows that on a dollar parity of $1·74 to the pound it was hoped that the cash flow might come above the line somewhere around 1990. But with a parity of $1·84 it would not come above the line until the end of 1991. Presumably, we could extrapolate a little, and, by the look of those curves, on a dollar parity of $1·94 it would be somewhere well into 1993 before there was a positive contribution of cash from that programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not likely, therefore, that in the next five years we shall get much out of that programme, in terms of generating cash for any other programme. Indeed, British Aerospace is unwilling to say when it first expects to sell an aeroplane. No delivery is expected before 1982, which is still three years away, and we are talking here in terms of five years. There will be three years before the first penny of cash comes in, so there are some real worries about where this money will come from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood the Minister, there will be need of another £250 million. Is that for the further contribution of British Aerospace to the Airbus consortium? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will confirm whether that is so, because it would make matters much easier for me. He is nodding, so I understand that it was for that programme alone. Where on earth will the monev come from for the other programmes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that it is the intention of British Aerospace to enter—with partners, certainly—into a further pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
ject in the market gap which quite clearly exists between the 100-seat class aeroplane and the 160-180-seat class aeroplane. I do not know how much that will cost, but it will not exactly be peanuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not try to get away with telling us a little about the 75 per cent, and the 80 per cent, voting rule and things of that sort and entirely glossing over the fact that we cannot go on making sums of money available bit by bit, without some idea of what the corporation's overall capital commitments are, what programmes it expects to be involved in and where it expects the money to come from. Does it expect to come to the taxpayer for the whole of that £250 million or does it expect to generate some of it internally, and if so, how much?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would be very interested to know what rate of return the taxpayer may now expect on the money being invested—not this £50 million, because the Minister does not know whether it is a grant, public dividend capital or something which is not one or the other. We know what it is today, but he says that it might not be that next week. Therefore, we would all be obliged if the Minister told us a little more about these capital requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.31 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Churchill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that we all welcome the involvement of British Aerospace in the Airbus Industrie programme. It is perhaps regrettable that we have been so slow in getting on board that particular bus. It now appears to be a winner, at least in the case of the A300 and I believe that we are very fortunate to be allowed to buy into the programme at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put only one question to the Minister, but I believe it to be important. He has spoken of £50 million being required today and another £250 million being required by 1983—I believe that was the date mentioned. These are large sums of money. One is talking of £2·50 per family in the case of the £50 million grant or funding and a further £12·50 per family by 1983—a total of about £15 for every family in the country. This is big money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People do not have £15 just to throw out of the window. They want to be

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
assured that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) said, there will be a proper return on this investment. I wish to know above all why it is always to the taxpayer that people turn for the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has indicated that if we go in on a 20 per cent, share, as we are going in, we may well be on the way to winning a fabulous $100 billion prize, or at least a large chunk of it. That is marvellous, but if the prospects are so good why does British Aerospace have to come to the taxpayer for this money? Why cannot it go to the market in London or elsewhere to raise this funding? Why does it always have to be the individual who pays out of enforced contributions? Why cannot it be those institutions and investors who will back a winner or at least a project that appears to have a good chance of being a winner?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always the taxpayer, particularly under this Government, to whom one has first recourse. It should be a matter of last recourse to come to the taxpayer. Far greater efforts should be made to raise this money on a commercial basis without coming to the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pattie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very broad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I consider them to be detailed within the context of our normal Committee Sittings and that is the spirit in which I intend to answer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised a point concerning the cash limit. I should have thought he would have been more worried had the cash limit been raised by more than £50 million. It has been raised precisely to encompass the section 45 injection of new money. I am sure the hon. Gentleman will recognise that cash limits cover all forms of Government finance, including grants such as those under section 45. Therefore, it is perfectly logical, and I do not think very surprising, that the cash limit has been raised at this time and in this way to take account of that new injection. I will not let the hon. Gentleman get away
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
with any implication that there has been some kind of relaxation in the control over the spending or the allocation of this money. That is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen have made various references to the amount of money which British Aerospace will have to be providing. I referred in my speech to the additional £250 million at 1978 prices—not 1977. Over the five years covered by the public expenditure White Paper, British Aerospace expects to generate internally over half its capital requirements. The bulk of these profits will come from exports. British Aerospace is involved in a wide variety of exports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These projects have been considered very carefully indeed. I remind hon. Gentlemen that we have already said that the financial objective for 1978 for British Aerospace was to make a 20 per cent, return on net assets. We have announced in Parliament that that is the kind of stringent financial discipline that we propose to apply to projects into which British Aerospace may venture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a matter of leaping into something that has not been considered carefully. It is not a matter of just having a go. We have given these projects very serious, deliberate and careful consideration and then come to a decision. Indeed, hon. Gentlemen were always pressing us to come to a decision more quickly than we did. It was important not to take the decision quickly but to get it right. That is why very careful consideration was given to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen have raised questions about the overall financial implications of the British Aerospace 146, as it is now called, and the A310. The development of these aircraft are expected to require the commitment of some £450 million by British Aerospace over the next five years. As I have already said, British Aerospace expects to fund a substantial proportion of that investment from its internal resources. The remainder will come from external resources, for example, such as the one I have been describing in the Committee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of the entry fee was raised. I think it will be recognised by the Committee that the return to British Aerospace from its membership of Airbus Industrie in the early years will obviously not be consistent with the corporation's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
financial objectives. The £50 million assistance is designed to help with the cash flow and thus improve the rate of return during the early period. I wish to stress once again that, taking account of the assistance and the wider commercial and industrial benefits, British Aerospace is satisfied that the prospective return on its investment is adequate. That has been considered very carefully indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen also referred to the prospects for the British Aerospace 146, and the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) gave us some carefully calculated tables about the fluctuation of exchange rates. He knows and I know that this is not the first aircraft which has been developed and proceeded with without having any initial launch orders. We confidently expect that the 146 will sell to a relatively large number of airlines throughout the world, although individual orders may be relatively small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing that the hon. Gentleman has said or the figures he has produced this morning would cause us to detract from the vote of confidence that we have already given in the House on numerous occasions to the British Aerospace 146.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen have referred to the size of the market. The $100 billion market that I was talking about was the overall civil airliner market. That is the overall size of the market in which British Aerospace and Airbus Industrie are competing. In the form of Airbus Industrie they have a substantial part of that market, and Airbus Industrie has its own longer-term ideas about other sections of the market. I think that we now have to take a wider view. As part of Airbus Industrie we shall certainly be helping to take decisions within that wider view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The market for the type of aircraft represented by the A300 and the A310 is about 1,500 units. That is probably worth about $40 billion. Airbus Industrie obviously hopes to get a substantial share of that smaller section of the overall market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that although it is a big project upon which we are embarking, it has been very carefully considered by the Governments involved. When the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Churchill) refers to the taxpayers' contribution, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
hope he will note that contributions in other European countries are frequently higher than the taxpayers' contribution which is required on specific projects in this country. Certainly, the German and French taxpayers have been asked to contribute quite substantially. It is a matter of covering the research and development costs and compensating for the lower rate of return during the initial period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are proposing this morning is nothing unusual. Indeed, it is common practice in other European countries. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, in recognising the size of the potential market, will also welcome not only the contribution which the taxpayer is being asked to make but the potential benefit to the taxpayer, because this is a project which we hope will go well and bring benefit to the taxpayer in return for the contribution he has to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons I hope that the Committee will agree to give a fair wind to this draft order. We wish Airbus Industrie every success, and I hope that the Committee will play its part in encouraging that this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly we wish Airbus Industrie every success. After all, it is our wallets which are attached to that aeroplane, so naturally we, as taxpayers, wish it every success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made some interesting remarks, although he did not entirely deal with all the questions which we raised. It will be very interesting to read carefully tomorrow what he said. I notice that he confirmed that the corporation expects to generate internally some 50 per cent, of the capital which it requires over the next five years. Since it is quite clear that that sort of money will not come from civil programmes' profits at present, because they are quite small, I am glad he has recognised that, even if he does not like to spell it out to his hon. Friends, the financing of these programmes depends on what his Tribunite friends—I am not sure whether he is still a Tribunite—would call selling weapons of death to undemocratic regimes. Those are the parts of the world where the weapons are being sold to our friends, in the Oman and Muscat and similar places. Until recently, there were questions raised over the future of arms sales in Iran and selling expensive military systems to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
our friend the Shah. There will be some—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must caution the hon. Gentleman about keeping in order. This subject matter has gone very much wider than the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Jones, we are discussing where the money is coming from to finance the project. It is simply no good if there is only £50 million. If the Minister were to say that the extra finance was not to be internally generated, we would clearly have to say that we could not agree to a £50 million payment towards a programme which did not have any other money. I shall not go too far down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point about the funding, but the hon. Gentleman was going far wider than the financial considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I think you will recollect, Mr. Jones, that there are wider considerations. But I will leave the matter there. I think that Labour Members, and most other people, understand the implications of these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also referred to a return of 20 per cent, on net assets as the target for British Aerospace. He said that that was the kind of return he expected on this kind of project. He later said that British Aerospace had told him that the prospective return on the A310 programme was adequate. Does that mean that British Aerospace has intimated to the Minister that it expects a 20 per cent, return on the investment in the A310 programme? That would be a very useful benchmark. If the figure is 20 per cent., we are delighted. If not, as the return is said to be adequate, we would like to know how adequate it is and by how much it deviates from the 20 per cent, return that the Minister expects on projects such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Les Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 20 per cent, return on fixed assets is the target which was publicly set for British Aerospace, for 1978 and I do not detract from that target at all. The purpose of the order is to compensate for the fact that during the earlier period of this project the rate of return will not generate that sort of amount of money. But I do not detract at all from the financial target to which I have referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the Minister is not making himself quite clear. We all know that in the early stages of a project there is a nil contribution to profits. One invests a lot of money and does not sell an aeroplane for five years or so. But does the Minister say that over the whole of its life—I do not mean over one or two years or even five years—the A310 programme is expected to show a net return of 20 per cent, on assets? Is that the kind of return—to use his words—that the Minister expects—again to use his words—on these kinds of projects—again to use his words?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Les Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being drawn by the hon. Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—like dragon's teeth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not refer to himself as a dragon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will recognise that an overall target of 20 per cent, has been set for British Aerospace, and every project—which has to be closely scrutinised by British Aerospace—has to be seen against the financial requirement. I have explained the position to the hon. Gentleman. I have also explained that because initially a project will give a lower rate of return than that, we believe that British Aerospace ought to be assisted. That is the purpose of the order, and I hope the hon. Gentleman will now feel able to approve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Churchill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to take it, then, that the Minister is defining "adequate" as the 20 per cent, to which he referred for British Aerospace as a whole? Can he now categorically state that on the best information and estimates available to him the 20 per cent, is what he and the Government regard as an adequate return—that was his phrase—on the investment by British Aerospace in Airbus Industrie?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise what hon. Gentlemen are trying to do. We are dealing here with a very significant project. We believe that British Aerospace has taken the right decision in taking this large step forward. Other Governments are making their contributions to the funding. This is what this order is all about. But I certainly do not detract from the fact that this project will have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
to fit in with the overall financial requirement that will be imposed on British Aerospace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong matters. I do not think that the Minister is willing to go any further. But it is interesting that British Aerospace is now engaged in two major civil projects—the 146 and A310 programmes—which will probably go on for a long time. The Minister says that 20 per cent, is the rate of return which is considered adequate. If he cannot assure us that the A310 programme will show 20 per cent, return he must have some information which suggests that the 146 will show more than 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Otherwise, we return to the question that I raised before: Is it intended that profits on the military side of the business will cover the 20 per cent, and that military profits will be kept at very high levels in order to cover civil project which do not make 20 per cent? That would have implications not just for export sales but for sales to our own defence forces. All that the Minister has to say is simply "Yes, we do expect the A310 investment to make 20 per cent. We do expect the 146 programme to make 20 per cent, return on investment. That is why we are in the business."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant, and it is worrying, that the Minister cannot say that about
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
either of those projects. I should be very glad if he would stand up and tell us which programmes in the whole inventory of British Aerospace he does expect will make 20 per cent, on assets over the life of the programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Les Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the hon. Gentleman is trying to draw me. He will obviously realise that the final level and the form of the objectives of British Aerospace have yet to be set out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So it is not 20 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not detracting from that at all. I am simply saying that that is the kind of return which has been set for British Aerospace. I am also saying that the detailed financial objectives for the corporation have yet to be set. Certainly, any kind of project that we are currently considering has to be considered within those kinds of objectives. I do not detract from the figure of 20 per cent, that I have given the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
