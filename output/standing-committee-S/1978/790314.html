	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Grants for Guarantees of Bank Loans (Extension of Period Order 1979.</p></blockquote>
I do not think that I need to detain the Committee long on this order, although it is important. The order was made on 25 January 1979, and a copy was laid before the House on 6 February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the order which is very limited, is to empower the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to pay grant in respect of a guarantee for a bank loan to an agricultural or horticultural business given during the five years up to 31 March 1984. The Minister's existing powers relate to guarantees given up to 31 March 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may like to be reminded that the original scheme for Government-supported loan guarantees was introduced in 1964 and was confined to horticultural businesses. It was extended to agriculture in 1965, at first under the Appropriation Acts, the whole being consolidated in the Agriculture Act 1967. That Act provides for the qualifying period to be extended for periods of up to five years by orders made by the Minister, subject to the approval of the Treasury. The orders do not, however, come into effect unless they are approved by this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements apply to all parts of the United Kingdom. They are operated through the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which gives guarantees to those farmers, growers and co-operatives which, although creditworthy, do not have enough security to obtain bank loans in the normal way. For its services, the corporation charges a fee of up to 2½ per cent, a year of the sum under guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of Government grant arises only if the borrower fails to repay
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the bank loan and the bank claims on the guarantor under the guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rate of grant is regularly reviewed. At present the Government have agreed to meet a maximum of 85 per cent, of any loan in default. The bank bears 5 per cent, of the default and the ACC bears the remaining 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Loans totalling £5½ million for well over 300 farmers are at present being guaranteed under these arrangements. Although these loans represent only a very small proportion of the total bank lending to agriculture—now over £1,900 million— the guarantee facility is important for those who use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is encouraging to note that whilst on average about 75 new guarantees have been given in each of the past four years, about 50 farmers each year who have had a guarantee for a period have been able to dispense with it and obtain loans in the usual way. Since the scheme started the total number of guarantees which have been given is 688, covering a sum of £9 million. There have been only 42 cases of default, leading to total grant payments of £262,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Loan guarantees for co-operatives were of only minor significance in the early years of the scheme, but an arrangement for marketing groups, introduced in 1972, has proved popular. Under it, on the recommendation of the Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Cooperation, the Ministry pays the ACC's fees in approved cases. Over £1 million of guarantees have been given under this arrangement since it was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should mention that there is a link between the order and the Farm and Horticulture Development Regulations. Under Directive 72/159/EEC, loan guarantees are one of the forms of assistance which must be provided for farmers with approved development plans. The United Kingdom implements this provision through the present loan guarantee arrangements, whose continuation depends on the approval of the order. I commend the order for the Committee's favourable consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.35 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition naturally welcome the order and the continuation of the Government guarantee. We should remember that it is but a guarantee. In my view it is not a grant. It is a grant only when there is a default,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
and I think that the Minister of State will agree that the record is exceptional in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original scheme was set up some 15 years ago under the Agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964. It was subsequently extended to include agricultural schemes under the Agriculture Act 1967
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a quite important question to ask the Minister. Since the passage of the Agriculture Act 1967 the Ministry has exercised a right which it may or may not have to contain the discretion of the Agricultural Credit Corporation as to the items on which it allows its facilities to be exercised. For example, in 1972 the Ministry came to an agreement with the ACC that it would not grant-aid processing plant which might or might not be on a farm. This did not mean that it could not grant-aid a potato store, but it could not grant-aid—I should say " could not guarantee the loan on," for I am falling into the trap of using the very words which I said we should not be using—the processing plant for washing, preparing and packing the same potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not question the wisdom of that decision, which was taken a long time ago and which has been accepted, I think, by the industry and by the corporation. But I should like to know the statutory basis on which such directions are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since that time the Brussels Commission has seen fit to interpret this innocent arrangement as a grant in aid. I do not see it in those terms, but Brussels has, and as a result the ACC is no longer allowed to lend on the purchase of dairy cows or, in general terms, pigs and poultry. Therefore, its sphere of operations is rapidly becoming constrained. We want to know how far this is likely to go and whether it is a matter on which the House should be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that under the price review recommendations currently placed by the Commission before the Council of Ministers, and subject to negotiations and the approval of the European Parliament and others, the future of capital grant aid in Europe is in question. As the original proposals were written, capital grants will cease to exist forthwith. I am certain that the Government will not be prepared to accept that, and will fight to see that it does not happen. Furthermore, I am sure that they will fight to see that any counter-proposals are not discriminatory—levelled, for example,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
solely at the larger British farmer. But the ACC must be concerned about this matter. In many cases it administers its schemes in conjunction with the farm and horticultural schemes. Therefore, any proposal to abolish the farm and horticultural schemes would have an enormous effect on the ACC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be right to pay some tribute to the efficiency of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the board of which is chaired by my former colleague, Mr. Anthony Stodart. I think that everyone agrees that it has been doing an exceptionally good job. The Minister has told us that 333 individuals are currently borrowing some £5.6 million, and no fewer than 19 cooperatives are obtaining guarantees of some £900,000, making £6½ million in all. The total administrative staff are five. There is a lesson there about allowing free enterprise—which is really what it is— to operate such schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a somewhat lower figure than the Minister for the total default over 15 years, but I bow to his superior knowledge and accept that £260,000 from a mere 42 cases over 15 years is a very low price to pay for the provision of some £6 million of credit, which must be earning more in six months for those who benefit by this than has been lost in 15 long years. Under the Act the Ministry is allowed to provide up to £240,000 in any one year, and yet it has scarcely needed that sum over the whole period of the existence of the ACC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average sum is currently guaranteed to the tune of about £17,000 per individual, so the schemes are quite substantial. I gather that the average is now rising to £20,000 or more. One can therefore say that this exercise has undoubtedly been enormously successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a philosophical thoughts as to whether, in view of the exceptional record, the joint stock banks are truly doing their full job. Why should such an organisation be needed to find a sum of over £6 million, when there is a marvellous default record and presumably a good return? If one is paying 2½ per cent., even if one can perhaps get a bit back off one's overdraft rate from the bank as a result of the credit guarantee, this shows that, given the expertise available in the agricultural world, and I strongly suspect, in the whole small business world, the way in which the banks exercise their discretion is not always as free and competitive as I should like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I should expect to be ruled out of order, Mr. Wells, if I were to go too much further, but why should this matter be limited to agriculture? There seems to be a lesson here to be learnt in other spheres. I shall not pursue that line of thought, because I see that you are starting to frown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the wake of the Crown Agents affair, the Treasury is properly considering all the Government's open-ended liabilities. There is a liability here of up to £240,000 a year. It is right and proper that the Treasury should examine that liability. But I hope that before the Government seek to interfere in any way further with the ACC they will not only bear in mind its exceptional record over a very long period but will take into account those who are responsible for operating the scheme and leave it to them. There is no doubt that they can be trusted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition strongly recommend the Government to leave the ACC alone and let it get on with its task, as it has been doing so successfully. I am glad to say that it will be doing so for at least the next five years as a result of the passing of this order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.44 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the lead given by my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) in broadly welcoming the order, but I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should like to make a short personal comment. I do not mean to be unkind to the Minister, but I very much regret that so often in Committee Ministers rattle through their briefs. When those briefs contain quite a large number of figures, those like myself who try to take a reasonable interest in these matters sometimes find it difficult to take in all the information so quickly. But I have done my best, and if my figures are wrong I hope that the Minister will correct me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency, like many on the south coast, has strong horticultural interests, particularly in the south. I understand that the arrangements for grants for guarantees cover horticulture. I should be interested to know what proportion of the loans given which are covered by guarantees and these grant arrangements relate to horticulture. In particular, could the Minister say for what sort of purposes these credits are used?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The Minister may not be able to give it on this occasion, but I should welcome some advice in the future on the question of land settlement associations. I have a number of LSAs in my area. They are important contributors to the horticultural industry, and I should like to know whether they are covered by these arrangements and to what extent they take advantage of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although some breakdown was given of the total amounts of loans guaranteed and covered by these arrangements, it may be of general interest for the Committee to know whether there is a functional split on the sort of use to which these loans are put in agriculture. Is it only the Agricultural Credit Corporation which administers the loans eligible for these grants for guarantees, or is it possible for a variety of other individuals and institutions to obtain such grant cover? My reading of the 1967 Act suggests that it is possible. Although the figure for the ACC was quantified, can the Minister say what figure is covered outside the ACC by these grant facilities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard that at present £500,000 worth of loans were being guaranteed and were eligible for grants in the case of default, and that under the present arrangements the Government would cover 85 per cent, of the default. Is the figure of £500,000 the total nominal amount of the loans outstanding or the Government's liability in this respect? If it is the former, I take it that the actual contingent liability on the Treasury must be just about £400,000 rather than £500,000. That difference of £100,000 is perhaps not a great deal in national terms, but it is still £100,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many applications for guarantees have been turned down? In quantifying how successful these provisions have been and the extent to which they are providing financial support by way of guarantee for agricultural ventures which would not otherwise go ahead, it is of some value for us to know how many applications have been made and how many have been turned down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned that certain fees of the ACC were covered under these arrangements. I believe he said that the amount involved was just over £1 million. I was slightly perplexed by that. To what do these fees relate, and was the figure in respect of them, which the Government have paid to the ACC, over £1 million?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I support the more general point made by my hon. Friend, which is importnat and valid, that is the level of default on the guarantees and grant arrangements made so far is extremely low, it surely points to some inadequacy in the existing financial arrangement for agriculture, I should be interested to know the reasons why in the majority of cases to which these arrangements apply the commercial banking system felt unable to take the liability, as it does in other areas of agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that particularly given the fact that over a short period a large number of the recipients of loans who benefit from these arrangements no longer need them and can revert to full commercial cover. This seems to point to some inadequacies in our commercial system, but that surprises me. Representing an agricultural constituency, I have always found a very helpful attitude towards agricultural among local commercial banks. The fact that there have been only 42 defaulters out of 688 guarantees—and one assumes that the defaults are at worst only partial— appears to mean that tying up, even in contingent form, a quite substantial sum of public money under these arrangements is perhaps slightly questionable if the private sector could do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if these arrangements are really worthwhile and providing valuable support to agriculture and horticulture, should not they be on a much grander or larger scale? If the commercial sector is already able to provide the kinds of services and support mentioned in the order, then—perhaps conversely there should be no such support at all. Given the operation of this scheme over a number of years, it is a reasonable question to ask the Minister to comment upon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate that has shown the Committee's general support for the continued availability of these Government guarantees. I believe that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) referred to the grant aspect, but this is really a guarantee which could involve some Government money. Hence one has to take care to see that things are as they should be. I am sure that it is right that hon. Members should have the opportunity every few years to look at the scheme and the operation of the grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that through the Government's backing for the Agricultural Mort-
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
gage Corporation we assist the availability of long-term lending to industry. Our support for the ACC through the grant we have been debating this morning, and in other ways, complements this by making it possible for a wider range of farmers and growers to obtain access to bank lending for such purposes as farm improvements. In this way it provides a modest yet very valuable addition to the range of financial resources for the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with some of the important questions which have been raised. I apologise to the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and the Committee if I tended to speak rather quickly, but I thought it wise to restrict my speech in order to give time for questions and replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point to be made is that there are a number of schemes whereby farmers can be financed in their work. Apart from the private sector, there the ACC, the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and help through the co-operatives. It may help the Committee if I detail some of these aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to look at the sort of borrower we wish to help both from the point of view of the kind of interest he has and the sort of financial backing he may or may not have. The scheme is primarily for those who, while creditworthy, have insufficient collateral to offer as security for a loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example is the young progressive tenant farmer in his early farming years who is anxious to expand but lacks the necessary funds. When people are rightly asking what more can be done to help the young farmer or to help other people to come into the industry, this is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is also available to help farmers and growers with approved development plans, and is providing a very useful means of assisting marketing cooperatives. Co-operatives form a very important sector, especially for the smaller people, who quite wisely combine in their operations. Since 1972–73 we have been operating a scheme under which marketing co-operatives that are unable to borrow as much as they need, either because, as a new organisation, they have not established an adequate record of operations, or because of insufficient collateral, may obtain a loan guarantee from ACC without having to pay the fee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
To qualify, a marketing co-operative must satisfy the Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation and the guaranteeing body that its proposition is sound. The ACC fees are then paid by the Ministry on the recommendation of the Central Council. Over £1 million-worth of guarantees have been approved through this mechanism since the scheme started. As the agricultural and horticultural co-operatives cover a wide range of the industry, this is beneficial, and I am sure that it will be helpful to the horticultural sector, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question whether Government support is adequate was raised. In my opinion it is. To meet the claims for grant, up to £300,000 per annum is available, plus any unspent balance for the previous two years. Since a grant of only £262,000 has had to be paid since the scheme started 15 years ago, this provision is expected to be more than adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) was probably right— and he was predictable—when he said that we should have the minimum amount of interference with the ACC and others who were doing these jobs. I accept that. He mentioned the Crown Agents. I am sure that he will not disagree when I say that we want to make sure that there are proper procedures for safeguarding public money and at the same time have the minimum amount of interference with or involvement in the way in which things go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that at present the Minister of Agriculture exercises the right of veto on any individual case that might be approved by the ACC, although it is rarely found necessary to exercise this veto. In our view, that is an adequate safeguard. So I hope that the Minister will not allow the Treasury to force the Ministry to extend its interference with, and control over, the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It all depends. If what has been done is unwelcome, it is probably called interference; if it is acceptable, it is called necessary interest and proper involvement. But I take the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ACC is mainly concerned to ensure that the borrower will be able to service the loan and meet the capital repayments. When an application is received, the farm is visited and the project for which the loan
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
is required is discussed and assessed, usually in consultation with the applicant's advisers and bank manager. That is understandable. When farmers submit development plans under the Farm and Horticulture Development Regulations, there is close liaison between the ACC and the departmental staff of the Ministry responsible for examining the development plans. So there has to be very close liaison when the Government are involved with the applicant's interest in another scheme operated by the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chichester asked about the percentage of successful applications. In the past six years roughly 63 per cent, have been successful. In cases where credit has not been given, I think that the ACC would have been responsible for taking that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to who finally decides whether a loan shall be guaranteed, the ACC can give guarantees on loans not exceeding £25,000 without reference to the Ministry. The figure is £50,000 in the case of co-operative marketing businesses. I think that that is reasonable. Above that figure, it is necessary to obtain the Ministry's prior approval. Special arrangements exist for close liaison with the Ministry over applications related to development plans under the Farm and Horticulture Development Regulations, and also to applications from co-operatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chichester, who has a special interest in horticulture, also asked about the kind of horticulture which is aided. I think that the figures show that dairying and dairying/arable benefit most, with just over 50 per cent, of the existing guarantees. The next largest groups are mixed farms, horticulturists and livestock farmers, all with about 15 per cent. each. The arable farms account for under 5 per cent, of the guarantees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As might be expected, it is the small farmer who benefits most. Fifty percent, of the guarantees are in respect of loans for farmers with under 150 acres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totted up the Minister's figures quickly in my head. Perhaps I misheard them, but the right hon. Gentleman seemed to give figures of 50 per cent., 15 per cent, and 5 per cent., which make 70 per cent, in total. Will he repeat that breakdown of the direction of those funds, because if the total is 70 per cent, it is meaningless?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason may be that I did not include all the groups. I merely said that the largest group was the dairying and dairying arable sector, which benefits most with just over 50 per cent. The next largest groups are mixed farms, horticulturists and livestock farmers, all with 15 per cent. each. The arable farms account for under 5 per cent. I think that that comes to about 100 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are three groups with 15 per cent, each, totalling 45 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, it is the small farmer who benefits most. Fifty per cent, of guarantees are in respect of loans to farmers with under 150 acres—I should have put that into hectares by now —and only 10 percent, of guarantees are in respect of farms of 500 acres—about 200 hectares in round figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is beneficial to the smaller farmer and the younger people coming into the industry. It meets the needs of the successful young farmer who wishes to expand but lacks the collateral to obtain a loan through the normal means. An analysis shows that 15 per cent, of guarantees have been given in connection with loans to farmers under 30 years of age and a further 33 per cent, for loans to farmers under 40 years of age. These are useful and encouraging figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare raised one or two questions about the implications that certain EEC proposals may hold for the ability to grant loans. One could ask how the Commission's proposals for dealing with the dairy surpluses in the EEC will affect the corporation's business. At present, guarantees cannot be granted in respect of loans for the purchase of cows or heifers intended for milk production. Any plans that the Commission may have for reducing aid to dairying could have the effect of further restricting the granting of guarantees in the enforcement sector of the corporation's business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the statutory basis for restrictions on all sectors covered by the ACC, the guarantees cannot be given for loans in the areas I have mentioned or for loans intended to finance processing, because this does not qualify as agriculture. The Agriculture Act 1967 limits the Minister's powers to make grants to loans
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
made for the purposes of an agricultural or horticultural business. The other restrictions stem directly, from the fact that guarantees of this kind are now governed by the EEC Farm Modernisation directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not say much more about that— to do so would be outside the terms of the debate—except that the Government's views on the CAP and any trends towards undue restriction are well known. We have very strong views on the EEC Commission's proposals for the dairy sector—the co-responsibility levy, the ban on investment aids and so forth—but I do not need to deal with those matters in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The efficiency of the arrangements between our Department and the ACC is kept constantly under review. At present, partly because of the growth in the number of applications under the grant schemes for which Ministry approval is required, it is felt that there is a need to simplify working procedures. We are examining ways of which that might be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chichester asked whether the ACC was the only body which guaranteed loans. I think that in practice the answer is "Yes" The Agricultural Finance Federation also gave guarantees for co-operatives, but it is now not active in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agricultural Credit Corporation has a record of which both it and the Government can be proud. That point was made by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare. Our grant payments over the 15 years of our support have represented less than 3 per cent, of the total sum guaranteed. That is a most impressive tribute to the staff of both the corporation and my Department, who have worked very much together in the operation. Indeed, that is a feature of the arrangements which I particularly commend to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ACC is an excellent example of how the farmers' unions and the Government can work together for the good of the industry. The corporation was originally set up by the United Kingdom farmers' unions and is a subsidiary of the National Farmers' Union Development Company. Under the leadership of a much respected former Member of this House, who occupied my own ministerial chair a few years ago, Mr. Anthony Stodart, whom we all know and respect, the corporation's small, tight-knit team of professional agriculturists has worked closely with the farmers and growers themselves, with the banks and with officials of my Department
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
in ensuring that the guarantee facility has been available in appropriate cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the nature of the problem we seek to tackle, this is a scheme for a minority of farmers and growers. It is, nevertheless, extremely useful and very valuable to those who need it. The Government's confidence in the future of the scheme has been shown by the order, which seeks to extend our power to make grant for the maximum permitted period of five years. I trust that the Committee will report favourably on the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong our proceedings, but I must refer again to the question of the restriction on guarantees. Under the Agriculture Act 1967, the guarantee can be given to a person
	<br><blockquote><p>"requiring the loan for the purposes of an agriculture or horticulture business,"</p></blockquote>
which is subsequently defined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the producing in the United Kingdom' of agricultural or horticultural produce for sale."</p></blockquote>
I take it that the restrictions that no guarantees shall be given for plant, the processing of agricultural produce, the purchase of dairy cows, pigs, or poultry have been imposed under section 64(2) of the Act, which begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may, in such manner and subject to such conditions as he may with the approval of the Treasury determine."</p></blockquote>
I think that I may have answered my own question; I think that that is really what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my point about the Government's trying to tell the ACC what to do. I am concerned that the list of restrictions will lengthen, to the point where the ACC will not be able to operate. I am particularly concerned that, in a way which I am afraid is becoming an increasing habit with the British bureaucracy, we are accepting what Brussels has said without a query.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Brussels has said that this is subsidised credit, but I do not agree with that. It is far from subsidised credit. It is credit which is paid for at 2½ per cent. It is true that it is guaranteed to a very tiny tune by the Ministry of Agriculture, which, without a murmur, has directed that we in Britain—who produce only 64 per cent. of our dairy requirements, as I need not remind the Minister—are therefore to be constrained in this matter by a directive from Brussels in a way which I certainly believe is open to debate. No other
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
European country accepts these things lying down. The Minister would be well advised to go back and inquire why we acquiesced so easily in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were ever to be sitting at the European Court to decide these matters— happily, this will never happen—I would take the view that the ACC was not providing subsidised credit. We have a very good case to argue that any restrictions on guaranteeing loans for these purposes do not fall within the Brussels directive. Therefore, if no other point emerges from the debate, I hope that this point is looked at again by the Minister, because I should like to see these restrictions removed from the ACC and its operations extended rather than contracted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To suggest that my right hon. Friend goes to Brussels and comes back merely as a messenger boy telling us what he has been given is far from the facts. Half of the time my right hon. Friend is accused of being unco-operative in Brussels and not accepting things in the way he should. I do not want to enter into debate on this, but I assure the Committee that we certainly do not accept things too easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the dairy sector, where there is a proposal for a ban on investment aids, the co-responsibility levy and so forth. I do not believe that there is any difference between the parties on some of the major points. Certainly, we want to give the maximum amount of freedom to our industry and its institutions to do their job without interference. However, I take note of what the hon. Member said, and I hope that his words may echo across the Channel beyond the confines of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the "tiny tune" of the Ministry's liability in this matter. At present the Government have agreed to meet a maximum of 85 per cent, of any loan in default. The bank bears 5 per cent, of the default and the ACC bears the remaining 10 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An annual maximum of £240,000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is £300,000—that is, if it is called in. But that is not the amount which has been expended over the 15 years. Therefore, the Government give a major amount of backing to the people who find this form of finance necessary. After all, this is not the only kind of finance. If a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
farmer can find money elsewhere, of course he is free to do so, but if he cannot this is a very important back-up which may not be available elsewhere. As soon as he finds that he can pay off most of the money, more aid is of course available for other people. He can finance his loans in any other way which may be of benefit to him. However, I take note of the hon. Gentleman's points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
