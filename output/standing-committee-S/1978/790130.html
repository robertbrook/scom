	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for The Home Department (Dr. Shirley Summers-kill)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Modification) Order 1978.</p></blockquote>
The order before the Committee, which will add a single drug, phencyclidine, to the drugs controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, is the fourth such order to come before the House since the 1971 Act was passed. Following our now established practice with these orders, copies of an explanatory memorandum have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, which describes the nature of phencyclidine and the dangers attending its misuse in non-technical terms which I hope members of the Committee may find helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and its subordinate regulations, drugs which are judged to cause physical and social harm when they are misused are made subject to controls designed to restrict their use to legitimate medical and research purposes. The drugs are listed in schedule 2 to the Act, where they are divided into three classes—A, B and C— broadly in accordance with an assessment of their harm if they are misused. The penalties for offences involving such drugs depend upon the class in which they are placed. These penalties are set out in schedule 4 to the Act. The regimes of control exercised over the lawful use of the drugs are specified in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1973. These regimes vary according to the medical usefulness of the drugs, as well as to their harmfulness when misused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From time to time it becomes necessary to add or remove drugs from the controlled list, or to move them from one class to another. This can happen because of changes in the international control of drugs, or because the advisory council on the misuse of drugs, which was set up under the 1971 Act to keep under review the situation in the United Kingdom with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
respect to the misuse of drugs, recommends that the current situation requires it. The relevant provisions of the Act permit such changes to be made by Order in Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order which we are now considering has been prepared on the recommendation of the advisory council on the misuse of drugs, to add the drug phencyclidine to the list of drugs in part I—or Class A—of schedule 2 to the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Phencyclidine has a proper use as a veterinary anaesthetic. A solution of the hydrochloric salt is used to control the larger animals in zoos and wildlife parks, and in animal experiments. Small quantities are imported from the United States under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for these purposes, as none is manufactured legally in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attraction of the drug for misusers lies in its hallucinogenic properties. When taken by humans, phencyclidine can have very unpleasant and dangerous effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience in North America, where its misuse has become a substantial problem, is that the drug has caused acute mental disturbances sometimes resulting in paranoic attacks and violent behaviour and, on occasion, coma and death. Other milder, but still unpleasant, side-effects such as feelings of hostility, apathy and depression, have been frequently reported by those misusing the drug.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Phencyclidine first came to notice as a drug of misuse in the mid 1960s in the United States, where it is now controlled under that country's drug abuse prevention and control legislation. The main source of the drug to misusers is from clandestine laboratories. It is relatively easy to synthesise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drug is generally taken by misusers orally in a tablet form known as the "peace pill", from which it has obtained the street name "PCP". Increasingly, however, it is smoked with cannabis, tobacco or parsley as a powder called "angel dust". Phencyclidine is also frequently mislabelled and sold as a more popular drug—LSD, cocaine, or tetra-hydrocannabinol, the main ingredient of cannabis. So far in the United Kingdom only sporadic outbreaks of misuse have occurred when small quantities of the drug, believed to have come from North America, have found their way here. However, following the publicity which it has received as "angel dust" in this country, its popularity among drug mis-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
users could well increase. There is also a danger of its entering the illicit market on a larger scale mislabelled as LSD, because of that drug's relative scarcity following the success of "Operation Julie".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has, accordingly, recommended that the distribution of phencyclidine should be controlled in the United Kingdom. It feels that the drug's dangerous pharmacological properties when wrongfully used by humans, the evidence of its attractiveness to some drug misusers, and the possibility of its misuse escalating, fully warrant its control under the 1971 Act as a precautionary measure. The professional veterinary bodies have been consulted and are in full agreement with the advisory council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if, in conclusion, I explain the type of control which will be imposed on phencyclidine if this order is approved by both Houses. Its addition to the list of drugs in part I of schedule 2 to the 1971 Act will mean that its unlawful manufacture, supply and possession will be offences liable to the highest range of penalties under the Act. In addition, once the order is made, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will lay before Parliament regulations which will prescribe the circumstances and conditions in which the drug may legitimately be used. They will provide for phencyclidine to be placed in schedule 2 to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1973. This will in no way limit its legitimate use in veterinary practice, but it will ensure that proper safeguards are imposed to prevent the licitly manufactured preparations falling into the hands of misusers. These safeguards take the form of requirements concerning the safe custody, prescribing and supply of the drug, and concerning documentation and record-keeping in connection with these activities. Manufacture will be subject to licence by my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said will have been sufficient to enable the Committee to understand the nature and purpose of this draft order. As I have indicated, its provision has been recommended by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, as is required by the 1971 Act, and it is on that recommendation that it is introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.40 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gerard Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I congratulate the Minister on explaining so clearly the problems around this drug?
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Quite frankly, when we came here this morning I was not sure what we were going to discuss. The Minister has put the situation very clearly to the Committee, and I can assure her that the Government have the full support of this side of the Committee in including this drug under the 1971 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are naturally very concerned about the recent increase in the taking of chemicals and drugs in everyday use as stimulants and addictive drugs. The other day I saw a young child who was thought to have schizophrenia and discovered that he was a glue sniffer. That rather shattered me. When we approached his school, the staff were not in the least surprised to hear this, because to their knowledge there were quite a number of children within the school who were acting in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today this Committee is discussing another drug—a veterinary one—which is being abused. I gathered from what the Minister said that the Government are quite happy about the way in which the legal procedures of the Act are being brought into effect. This is a good example of its beneficial effect for the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister three questions. I should like to know the number of cases that have been brought to official notice. I should like to know whether there have been any deaths since the drug has been being watched. Finally, are there other drugs in this group which at the moment are not included under the 1971 Act but which are likely to be brought before us in the near future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.42 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan) has referred to the subject of glue sniffing. I believe the technical phrase is "inhaling of toxic substances". I wonder whether I might take the opportunity of this meeting to refer to the subject because I—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not go beyond this very narrow order. I did not say anything to the hon. Member for Reading (Dr. Vaughan) but one must be careful, on these narrow orders, to stick to them as strictly as is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I wish to say anything further, Mr. Wells.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall stop the hon, Member if need be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please bear in mind, Mr. Wells, that as a new member of this Committee I need to be kept on the right lines. I wish to raise the subject of glue sniffing. I would like to know whether the drug that has been referred to by the Minister has the effects that have also occurred as a result of the practice of glue sniffing. I have attempted to raise the question of the inhaling of toxic substances through a parliamentary question. I was then referred to the Adjournment debate last December. I have looked through the record of that debate. I understand that the Ministry is relying on educational means to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can manage it, although it is a good effort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the question asked by the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan), as I indicated in my speech, there is no evidence at the moment to suggest that misuse of phencyclidine in this country is a significant problem. The main purpose of this measure is to ensure that it does not become a significant problem. There have been seizures of the substance. We have no figures of medically affected people, but we have figures of seizures of the substance in 1977, which I can give the hon. Gentleman. It is because the substance was seized during 1977 and 1978—although I do not have the figures for 1978—that this was regarded by the Advisory Council as being a serious development, and that, therefore, a threat was posed by this drug. It was decided that it should come under some sort of control. As far as we know, no deaths have resulted from misuse of the drug, but here again this is a preventive measure rather than a reaction to what has already happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.46 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, it is commendable that a draft order is brought before a Committee in respect of a drug such as this, regardless of whether the Minister believes that it is a big problem or not. I think that it is better to nip these things in the bud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very often, when an anxomaly or difficulty is raised with the Minister, we are told to wait until a larger area is investigated before we deal with it piecemeal. Will the hon. Lady convey to her right hon. Friends that what she is doing today is a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
very good idea? If some such problem as this arises or might arise, it is to the benefit of the House and of the country that it is nipped in the bud. Will she tell her right hon. Friends that this kind of procedure should be adopted in other instances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Dr. Miller). As I said in opening, this is the fourth such order to come before the House since the Misuse of Drugs Act was passed in 1971. That type of Act is very useful for the House, in that substances can be added to it as they occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.48 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come back to the third question I asked the Minister—whether there are other drugs in this range in veterinary use which might be suspicious for this kind of effect. It is clear that my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson) and I are very concerned about the accidental development, initially, of addictive substances of this kind. What steps does the Minister propose to take now, so that people in the veterinary profession recognise the dangers? There is alway a problem here that if one advertises a substance too much, people become attracted to it and think "Ah, there is a new one on the market" and they rush in to try to get hold of it. Especially if it is in general use, it may be very difficult to control that. On the other hand, one wants people to know of its dangers since there are, from time to time, accidental toxic effects to people who did not realise that they were handling a dangerous substance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first question, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is presently considering the possible control of certain barbiturates. But it is a council which can, in theory, consider any substance that it wants to. But it is important that it should consider barbiturates, because they have been slightly neglected over the years. That may be one which will come before this Committee, but I cannot be sure until the council reports.

I was asked about glue sniffing. For some strange reason, that comes under the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection—the latter part, probably. But obviously it impinges upon the Depart-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What steps do the Government propose to take now? What happens after today? Do they advertise generally to members of the veterinary profession that this is a dangerous substance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson) was, I think, about to ask what sort of educational steps will be taken, so that people will understand the risks that they are running.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman asked me that. Subject to the agreement of Parliament to the making of the order, further subordinate legislation, which will be subject to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
negative resolution procedure, will be introduced to apply a specific regime of control to phencyclidine. Arrangements will be necessary to ensure that the legitimate use of the drug in veterinary medicine is not restricted. So it will be listed in schedule 2, which will mean that vets will still be able to use it at their discretion, subject to the requirements relating to prescribing, record-keeping and safe custody.
