TOBACCO PRODUCTS (HIGHER TAR CIGARETTES) REGULATIONS 1978</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first inform the Committee that I have given considerable thought to whether we could take these two regulations together. The disparity of the subject matter is such that it would not be for the convenience of the Committee. We shall, therefore, take them separately.</span></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Gerard Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Tobacco Products (Higher Tar Cigarettes) Regutions 1978 (S.I. No. 1156).</p></blockquote>
On the face of it these regulations are innocuous technical regulations until one looks closer, particularly at the circumstances behind them. I believe that it will help the Minister if I begin by raising the three points that concern us.<br><br>
First, the regulations appear to be a clear breach of faith by the Government. For some years the industry has been cooperating with the Government to bring about a reduction in smoking and on a general health programme concerning tobacco products and how they should be marketed. The industry is pleased with the progress which has been made.<br><br>
Earlier this year the industry had a clear understanding from the Minister of State that if it followed the programme which was discussed in March no further regulations would be introduced until 1980.<br><br>
The industry has been pursuing a programme of health warnings on packets and on advertisements—which I believe has been very successful—as well as a programme for an advertising code of practice. The industry has been cooperating with the Hunter Committee on substitutes and additives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Mr. Roland Moyle)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Minister of State. Is he referring to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State or myself?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that in a moment.<br><br>
The industry entered into a voluntary agreement on sponsorship which was agreed in December 1977. It also entered into a voluntary agreement about a move towards low tar cigarettes in March 1977. It is that agreement which has now been broken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is referring to me as the Minister of State, our agreement with the tobacco industry is that we would not seek to alter those matters in the agreement for three years from the date of entry. There is no mention of taxation in that agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is particularly relevant to the regulations before us today. On 8th March 1977 the Secretary of State announced a three year package, agreed voluntarily with the industry. The package was to include a whole series of items—I shall not go through all of them—but the immediate step was that no main media advertising should be carried out on brands of cigarettes in the high tar group.<br><br>
By 31st December 1978—which we have not yet reached—there was to be no major advertising of the brands in the middle to high tar groups. The industry also agreed that no new brand would be introduced with a tar yield of more than 23 mg. The industry agreed that no existing brand would have its tar yield intentionally raised. No brands would appear in the high tar group of the Government's tar tables after 31st March 1979.<br><br>
I am referring to these dates because we have not yet reached December 1978 We are not yet at March 1979, although, again there was an agreement. I will not go through the remaining items of the package, but the point I want to make is that here was an agreement entered into voluntarily by the industry with the Government embodying dates which have not yet been reached. The industry was moving steadily towards honouring its undertaking, and suddenly into this area are thrown regulations which are pushing at a process which was occurring anyway.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
No doubt, one of the Ministers will tell us that the introduction of the regulations has been satisfactory in that since they were introduced there has been a marked fall-off in the tar yield. Frankly, that was happening anyway. What has occurred is that they have pushed at a process which was taking place. Quite naturally, therefore—and rightly, I believe—the industry is upset that it was honouring its side of the agreement yet the Government have not honoured their side.<br><br>
The second point I make is that the schedule is technically faulty. Its criteria are difficult to carry out. The industry has been left in a state of uncertainty as to whether it was fulfilling the requirements. I do not think that the Government should have introduced regulations such as these which are sloppy in their wording and which I understand, are against the advice which the industry gave as to how this control should be regulated.<br><br>
There is also the question of freedom of choice. Whether we like it or not, a large section of the population wishes to retain the right to exercise its own judgment on various matters. I, as a doctor, find myself in a dilemma, for example, over seat belt legislation. There is no doubt but that the introduction of seat belts is a strong safety measure. But a large number of people wish to be free to decide whether they wear seat belts. We had the same sort of issues with crash helmets as we have here with smoking. When this matter was raised during Committee stage of the Finance Bill it was put very strongly indeed that it was wrong of the Government to use legislation for social manipulation. My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I cannot say that I approve of the prospect of directing social policy by penal taxation. Much is said about freedom of choice of the individual. Much is said also about Governments keeping away from altering the social patterns of life by artificial means. Yet here is a tax which, by the Chancellor's own admission, has been introduced purely to alter people's preferences by putting a higher tax on certain cigarettes.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Where will this principle end once it is established? Shall we be told next which drinks are good for us to drink, which shoes are good for us to wear, which places are good for us to visit—"—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 17th May 1978; c. 8.]</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
I quoted that in full because it highlights a view which we take. There is a limit to the way in which legislation should be used to direct what many people regard as our personal lives. It was on that basis, that I, on behalf of my party, put down the prayer against these regulations.</span></p>
<p>10.39 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I was completely flabbergasted to hear the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan) speak as he did at the end of his speech. He mentioned the problem of freedom of choice and he instanced crash helmets. What we did in that case was to take away the freedom of choice and to insist on the wearing of crash helmets. In that case we as a society must have agreed that that was the right thing to do. If, in his opinion, seat belts give the extra safety that he says they do, we ought to consent to that measure, too. In these regulations I believe that we should bear in mind that aspect rather more than the other one.<br><br>
I do not know how many Members of the Committee are addicted to cartoons, but I read a periodical called the <i>Weekly News,</i> not for what is written in it, but for the cartoons. That periodical regularly features a character called "Wee Hughie". One cartoon that appeared many years ago has stuck in my memory ever since. "Wee Hughie" is sitting in his pyjamas on the edge of his bed. The clock says seven o'clock—presumably in the morning, because he has a lot of shadow around his jaw. The next frame shows him lighting his cigarette, his wife beginning to look rather annoyed. Then there are other frames showing him spluttering and coughing. Finally, his face lights up and he says "Aa aye say, the first wan's the best wan o'the day", which I shall translate for anyone who is not expert in the Glasgow dialect as "The first one is the best one of the day." I thought that was funny. But I am quite convinced that there are households in this country where that is the first scene of the day. It would be better for us all if that were not so. One valid way of looking at the problem is through the eyes of the cartoonist. But for a more sober way, I turned to the reports of the Scottish Home and Health Department, and principally to the 1974 report, which devoted a whole chapter precisely to that subject and which put quite a different complexion
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
on the matter to that put by the hon. Member for Reading, South. The chapter opens with a categorical statement:
<br><blockquote><p>"Cigarette smoking is the largest single avoidable health hazard in Scotland today".</p></blockquote>
The paragraph then gives a statistic:
<br><blockquote><p>"Scotland spends more per household and a larger percentage of total weekly expenditure on tobacco than any other area of Britain."</p></blockquote>
The paragraph concludes menacingly and laconically:
<br><blockquote><p>"Its health statistics show that it pays the penalty."</p></blockquote>
I believe that we should consider today's statutory instrument in the light of that report.<br><br>
I want to refer to one further paragraph. Paragraph 6.7 deals with perinatal mortality. It states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"about 1,500 perinatal deaths occur each year due to smoking during pregnancy".</p></blockquote>
These babies are lost simply because of their mothers' smoking. In addition, it says that the great majority of children who survive:
<br><blockquote><p>"suffer slight but measurable long-term physical and mental ill-effects at least until the age of seven."</p></blockquote>
It is these early years that are so vital in a child's physical and mental development. Mothers will have played a significant role in lastingly harming their children. Therefore, we in Parliament should do everything we can to mend the ways of these people, and we should do it with a good conscience.<br><br>
Finally, I should like to pay tribute to the Scottish Health Education Unit. It has done a fine job in its efforts to educate people away from smoking through the use of television, press, posters, leaflets and films. I mentioned "Wee Hughie", and I should like to say that the Scottish Health Education Unit is now using cartoons in Lowland Scots to get its message over. As a Scots speaker myself, I am delighted about that. I believe that Gaelic, too, should be used. A pointed cartoon in the Gaelic quarterly "Grairm" could carry the message to Highlands and Islands hearts, too.<br><br>
By supporting these regulations we shall be doing a little to reduce the misery caused by lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and coronary heart disease, all of which are among the modern curses in Scotland and, indeed, perhaps in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
a lesser way, in other parts of the United Kingdom. I hope that in his reply, the Minister will resist any blandishments, threats or talk of freedom of choice from the official Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman always in favour, then, of compulsion or is he in favour of education in these matters? Much of his speech seemed to be in favour of education and understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am in favour of both. I see it as a two-pronged fork, and the Scottish health education unit is doing an excellent job in persuading people. As a former teacher, I had the impression that there was less smoking among young people towards the end of my teaching career than there was at the beginning. I hope that that trend will continue. I am in favour of measures such as this in order to give encouragement. There must be a bit of the carrot and a bit of the stick; that is always good in education.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Cope <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gloucestershire, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I start by declaring that I have a constituency interest. My constituency is near Bristol, which is well known for its tobacco trade. However, I have no personal interest in the tax. I am a non-smoker. I have not smoked a cigarette for a great many years, nor have I smoked many in total during my life.<br><br>
This tax is intended not to raise revenue but to change habits. It is worth remarking that the last person who wants smoking stopped in this country is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, because he could not possibly afford the loss, of £.2½ billion in revenue which the actual stopping of smoking would cause him. Quite frankly, I believe that the tax is the muddled product of sloppy thinking. That was demonstrated to a certain extent in Committe and is demonstrated even more by these detailed regulations. It introduces a complicated new chunk of tax law, of which these regulations form a part, and which, so far as I can see, has been hastily shambled together. It involves a penal tax based on highly wobbly statistics, as I shall seek to show in a moment.<br><br>
Anybody who has actually studied the details of how the tar measurement works could support the tax, which is based on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
that method of measurement, only if he were as blindly anti-smoking as the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Thompson) seems to be. He appears to be so against smoking that he will accept any measure of compulsion or anything else against it.<br><br>
I think that, even if one is against smoking, it is not desirable to introduce a shambles of this kind into our tax laws, which already give rise to enough problems. I do not seek to argue in any way the health merits or demerits of cigarettes in general or of higher tar cigarettes in particular.<br><br>
However, I should like to remark, in passing, that the fact—if it is a fact—that the lack of higher tar cigarettes may reduce the incidence of certain diseases does not mean that those who give up smoking on that account, or who move on to cigarettes in lower tar brackets, will therefore, live for ever. It means that they will die of some other disease, or of the same disease caused by some other factor. It may or may not be in the interest of their happiness, but whatever else it means it is likely to prove more expensive to the rest of us in paying old pensions than the present set-up.<br><br>
Having said that, I wish to return to the details of the regulations. I should like to put to the Financial Secretary two sets of questions, as it were, the first related to the details of what the regulations mean and the second about the effect in practice of the regulations.<br><br>
The regulations have been in force for two months. We complained at the time that the Finance Bill was brought before us that it would not be possible to have the detailed regulations available by the time they had to be put into effect, because of the very early date from which the tax was supposed to apply. Unfortunately, the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) in Committee was tied. However, it fell later on and therefore the date remained as it is. The regulations have been in practice for a couple of months.<br><br>
In considering the details of the regulations, the Committee should realise that tar measurement is not an accurate science. Tobacco is a natural product, and tar is not inherent in the tobacco; it is produced by the smoking process. The method of smoking makes an enor-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
mous difference to the amount of tar which is drawn out of the cigarette into the smoker's lungs—or into the smoking machine, if that is the object which is smoking it rather than a person—in particular, how many puffs are taken, what size of puff, whether the cigarette is held horizontally or vertically or pointing up or pointing down, the length of the butt that is left, and so on.<br><br>
The regulations provide that, to produce his tables of high and low tar, the Government chemist shall test a very small sample of cigarettes—25 cigarettes of each brand, out of literally millions of cigarettes. The regulations, therefore, give the force of law to international standard ISO 3308 of 1977. The regulations say that the automatic smoking machine shall comply and be operated in accordance with that standard. However, I understand that the standard is a machine specification rather than a specification of the method to be used in testing cigarettes on the machine, and that it is therefore possible to get different results by using different methods of testing on it.<br><br>
I understand also that there are different machines which can obtain different results, although they all comply with the standard specification. The two that are apparently in general use in this country now by both the Government Chemist and the companies are the Filtrona 300 and the Phipps and Bird machines. Is it intended that these machines shall be used in future, or are different machines, which are also apparently permitted under the international standard, to be used?<br><br>
The next point is about conditioning. Paragraph 1 of the Schedule says that conditioning shall be in accordance with the ISO 3402–1975, using atmosphere A. I understand that this provides for tolerances in the conditioning of the cigarettes that are being tested of plus or minus 1ÂC, and that a draft amendment, ISO 3402/DAM 1, in the course of acceptance by the International Standards Organisation, would allow a tolerance of plus or minus 2 per cent, on the tolerances that are acceptable under ISO 3402.<br><br>
As far as I can see, there is no provision in the regulations as they stand for the acceptance of that amendment without another statutory instrument
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
being laid before the House. If that is so, the regulations will become out of date by comparison with the international standard. If it is not so, we should like to know how the amendment—or any future amendments for there may be many more to the standard in the future—will pass into British law from the International Standards Organisation.<br><br>
My next point concerns the preconditioning of the filter discs and filter holders. This is not provided for either in the regulations or in International Standard 3308, yet it is important because it affects the measurement of how it is done.<br><br>
These points may seem technical, but they are extremely important to the way in which the results of these tests come out. I am sure that they are not novel points for the Minister because they were all raised with officials at the beginning of July, so there has been ample time to deal with them even before the regulations were laid. I assume that they were considered at that time and I am sure that the Financial Secretary will be able to respond to them.<br><br>
Other points were raised at the same time. For example, there is no indication in ISO 3308 as to whether there should be electrical or flame ignition. This again can make a difference to the way in which the measurement finishes. Also, different types of holders are allowed by ISO 3308, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will state which it is intended to use.<br><br>
One particular point concerns cigarettes with an oval cross section. There a,re a few brands which have an oval cross section, and apparently at present there is no holder available under ISO 3308 which deals with these matters. Presumably it is this kind of point which the regulations are intended to cover in paragraph 7 of the schedule.<br><br>
I consider paragraph 7 most extraordinary. It provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"Where owing to abnormality in the shape, size or construction of any cigarettes the procedure set out in paragraphs 1 to 5 … is … inappropriate"</p></blockquote>
—that is, in the judgment of the Commissioners, I assume—
<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be applied in respect of those cigarettes with such modifications as the Commissioners after consultation with the Govern-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
ment Chemist and the manufacturer or importer shall specify."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that is legal under the Act. The Finance Act 1978 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners may make regulations—(<i>a</i>) prescribing how the tar yield of cigarettes is to be determined for the purposes of this section; .</p></blockquote>
It does not say that the Commissioners may make regulations prescribing that they shall specify some time in the future—without having to come to Parliament and without having to lay a statutory instrument—when they shall be allowed to decide how the tar yield of cigarettes is to be determined for the purposes of this provision.<br><br>
I am not a lawyer and it may be that this phrase covers the point, but perhaps the Financial Secretary can reassure me about it.<br><br>
The next section of the Act states that the Commissioners may, as far as duty being remitted or repaid is concerned—this is also covered in another part of the regulations—"specify or determine" in the regulations. So, in the case of duty being remitted or repaid, the Commissioners do have the power to determine what shall be done. But in the case of prescribing how the tar yield of the cigarettes is to be determined, there seems to be no power in the Act which would support paragraph 7 of the schedule to the regulations. If I am correct, that is an important point, and I should be grateful for the Financial Secretary's views.<br><br>
My last point on this first group of questions concerns paragraph 3(3) of the regulations, which states,
<br><blockquote><p>"The tar yield shall be taken to be the arithmetic mean of the results of tests …"</p></blockquote>
That is all very well, and indeed it is necessary to have some such provision because the measurements, even of the 25 cigarettes which the Government Chemist takes, will vary several points in the milligrams of tar even when smoked by the machine in the controlled conditions used by the Government Chemist. But why the arithmetic mean? Why is not the median, or, for that matter, the geometric mean being used?<br><br>
I turn now to how the regulations are working in practice. How is the Government Chemist getting on? Before the Finance Act and before this new tax came
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
into force, he was testing about 100 brands—those, I understand, which sell more than 10 million cigarettes in a year. On that basis his latest results were about a year old. He did it on roughly a six-monthly basis and the latest results were a year old—not a very good basis for a tax, and unacceptable as a basis for forming this tax, particularly with the uncertainties of tar measurement.<br><br>
I presume that the Government Chemist is now having to test not 100, but 200 brands. The fact that they are not popular brands makes no difference. He still has to test 25 cigarettes of even the smallest selling brand. So how far behind is the Laboratory of the Government Chemist in testing? How many brands have been tested, or whatever is the arrangement? To undertake this extra workload and to catch up with the backlog, has the Government Chemist taken on any extra staff, occupied extra premises, or taken over any additional equipment? If so, at what cost, because that is clearly part of the collection costs of this tax and it would be of interest to us—after just over two months in operation—to know the position.<br><br>
Finally, as regards the tar measurement, can we be told what is the biggest difference so far found between the highest and lowest tar measurement in samples of similar cigarettes? That figure would indicate to the Committee the uncertainties of the tar measurement system, even under the process of these regulations and the details I have described. It would demonstrate the uncertainties of tar measurement and the deeply unsatisfactory nature of trying to base a deliberately penal tax on so haphazard a statistical exercise.</span></p>
<p>11.1 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make only two important points. The Government should recognise that there is a form of voluntary control in the industry. I for one have made clear on occasions that it needed tightening in certain areas. However, on the whole it works extremely well. When the Minister replies I hope that he will address himself to the two important questions that my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan) raised, because they are important to other industries, too.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
Let me deal with those two questions. First, why is it necessary for the Government to go against the commitment which was given to the industry relating to the time basis during which it would adjust itself? Why was that commitment broken, and what was it that caused the Government to move ahead of the originally agreed time schedule? Secondly, why have the Government ignored the technical advice of the industry and produced their own method of calculation?<br><br>
Surely the one thing that we have all learned is that on the whole government is a poor substitute for the management of industry. Change costs industry money, and accordingly it has to be phased over a period of time. Budgeting has to be arranged and cash flow provided for. It is not good enough for the Government to change their mind willy-nilly on a previously agreed commitment.<br><br>
Those are two simple questions and I hope that the Financial Secretary will address himself to them.</span></p>
<p>11.2 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan) which initiated the debate surprised me. I did expect that some would argue that taxation should not involve itself in matters other than the strict raising of revenue despite clear resulting advantages.<br><br>
But I would not have thought anyone with responsibilities for health would need to make that sort of point when there are others who have constituency interests and are readily available, such as the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Cope). The health aspects of the argument could be left to someone for whom health considerations should be the overriding concern.<br><br>
I recall going, with my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Pavitt)—it was about 10 years ago—to the room at the Treasury which I now have the privilege of occupying. The then Financial Secretary was the present Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. I visited him to show him how taxation could have some effect upon reducing death and sickness caused by the smoking of cigarettes. The hon. Member for Brent, South provided the medical evidence and I provided
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
details of some of the ways in which, in a modest fashion, taxation might be used to this purpose. It has been my privilege to implement the ideas that I put forward, together with my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South, all those years ago.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Reading, South talked about a breach of faith with the tobacco industry. I must express my surprise at that comment, especially coming from him. He referred to the voluntary agreement between the industry and the Government, useful if modest. There was no hint in any part of that agreement of anything which might preclude us from taking taxation measures in the way that we did. If that restriction had been implied I should be astonished if the tobacco industry—with all its resources and capabilities—denied itself the opportunity of putting this into an agreement if it felt that it was so important a matter.<br><br>
The idea of a taxation surcharge on cigarettes with higher levels of tar has been with us in discussions and consultations for a very long time. When the voluntary agreement was made the considerable attractions of the surcharge idea were voiced publicly. It would have been astonishing if we had failed to introduce this, simply because of some oversight in an industry as voluble, as skilful and as important as the tobacco industry. It has been my great concern that anything I do should not bring about the smoking of dangerous cigarettes and should not damage the industry as a whole, because it is an important industry. I respect the way in which the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South represented the views of the industry, as it has a right to expect, because its affairs must concern all of us in so far as the manufacturing and selling capacities of the trade are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that the Minister takes a slightly ruffled approach to what was said, because it is a very serious criticism of the Government's handling of the matter. Does he not find it rather curious that the Government should enter voluntarily into an agreement with the industry, that on 8th March the Secretary of State should announce a three-year package, that there should be specific dates set out—at which we have not yet arrived—and then, with-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
out letting that run its course, the Government should introduce these regulations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would be delighted if the result of what we did reduced the incidence of those diseases attributable to cigarette smoking. I thought that the hon. Gentleman's purpose in moving this prayer was to come to this Committee and explain his pleasure at such a move. I expected him to go further and point out his own contribution to the action taken by the Government. As for the health of the nation, which must be his prime responsibility, I expected that he would be encouraged by what we have done. I shall say something about the desirable consequences of these regulations later in my remarks.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South, with his constituency interest, pointed to some technical points with which he found fault. The hon. Member for Reading, South also dealt with some of these.<br><br>
I must defend the regulations because our consultations with the industry resulted in these tests as prescribed in the regulations. During Committee stage of the Finance Bill I gave an undertaking—not a regular thing in such cases—that I would set out the detailed form of these tests. This does not normally find its way into legislation, as the hon. Member will know. We undertook to do this because that was what the Committee wanted and what I perceived the House wanted. I was happy to do this. But what is important is that these regulations meet the requirements of the legislation and also of the industry itself. These regulations, were well established by a joint committee of the Government and the tobacco industry—the Standing Scientific Liaison Committee—on a fully rehearsed statistical basis.<br><br>
As for the number of cigarettes tested, the absolute minimum from any one set of samples is 25 and in practice tar yield is normally determined on the basis of results from at least 150 cigarettes. I hope that this makes it clear that what has been described, quite rightly, as a proper scientific method, is based very largely on internationally accepted standards, and that the results have a degree of accuracy which makes it possible to ensure that no cigarettes with a true
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
mean tar yield below 20mg become liable to the supplementary duty. That is the important thing. I take the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. We have tried to ensure that we have that degree of accuracy which the nature of the industry requires.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to paragraph 7 of the schedule. As he rightly points out, this is largely concerned with oval shaped cigarettes. He made some criticism of this. In fact, this paragraph was suggested by the industry because it felt that certain types of cigarettes—perhaps not in such common use as they used to be some years ago, but nobody can be sure of the vagaries of fashion—should be subject to special testing. We were happy to accommodate the industry on this point. I think that the requirements of the industry need to be listened to, that the consultative process must be maintained, and I have sought to do just that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should not take it that I am solely the spokesman for the industry. Of course, I have consulted the industry, but I do not regard myself as solely the spokesman for the industry on this or any other occasion.<br><br>
I should not like the Minister to deal with the principal point which I made in this connection, which is whether it is his view and his advice that paragraph 7 of the schedule is legal under the terms of the Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The vires are established in the way set out in the Finance Act 1978. If the hon. Gentleman refers to the Act he will see that the vires are dealt with and confirmed there. I accept, of course, that the hon. Gentleman is not a spokesman for the tobacco industry. I never sought to contend that. I know the very wide interests of the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South. The House must always listen with respect to those who have a constituency interest, as well as those, such as the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South, who have a wider concern in all fiscal matters.<br><br>
Perhaps I may say something about what has happened since these regulations were introduced, because there can be no doubt, that smoking, and particularly cigarette smoking, has an injurious effect on the health of smokers. The experts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
cannot be sure precisely how or why this happens, but they do know that smoking is responsible for a wide variety of unpleasant and painful diseases. This causes much unnecessary suffering and, of course, a large number of premature deaths.<br><br>
Detailed studies have shown quite conclusively that high tar cigarettes do more damage to health than low tar cigarettes. The United Kingdom's response to this research was to introduce legislation in this year's Finance Bill to charge additional tax on all cigarettes whose tar yield is 20 mg or more. The effect on that part of the market has been striking. The proportion of the cigarette market now affected by the surcharge is 3 per cent., compared with the 15 per cent, which was rated at 20mg or more when the surcharge was introduced in the Budget. This change has taken place over a very limited period.<br><br>
This, of course, is exactly what we wanted—not the revenue from the surcharge, but an improvement in the health of the nation. The yield of the surcharge is now likely to be only about £10 million compared with about £25 million which might have accrued to the Exchequer had no change in the cigarette market occurred.<br><br>
This pronounced change in the market, as a direct result of the introduction of the tar surcharge, will have reduced, in many cases significantly, the risks of ill-health and of premature death, which are at their greatest among smokers of cigarettes with a high level of tar yield.<br><br>
We can, therefore, rightly claim, as did the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Thompson) that that action has directly affected one of the curses not only of Scotland but of the whole United Kingdom. We have sought a way of allowing people to carry out their normal pattern of behaviour. There is no compulsion in it, only a higher tax charge for those who wish to indulge themselves in this way. The result has been that some cigarette companies have altered or switched not the brands, but the composition of the branded product. Each brand has moved towards lower tar content. That has been a valuable result, and speaking personally, it is one form of tax avoidance which I welcome wholeheartedly. I hope that the Committee will accept it, too.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister sits down, I wonder whether it would be helpful to him if I told him that we have had some information that may not yet have been made available to him. Work has been carried out by the tobacco industry on the effect of this change. The industry's view—I am sure that the figures will be made available to the Minister—is that there is already a marked decline in the smoking of high tar cigarettes. The sales of brands of that kind had already declined to a mere 9 per cent, by the end of 1977. The industry's view is that it was the steps taken under the voluntary agreement that constituted the main factor in that result.<br><br>
Further, there is the slightly disquieting thought that the suddenness of the changes may have had an effect on some smokers, leading them to compensate by increasing the number of puffs, and changing the way in which they smoke the cigarettes. There is a body of opinion which feels that things were moving satisfactorily—I speak now as a doctor—in the direction that we all want to see, and that it was a mistake to introduce a sudden change when the gradual effects were becoming evident. In some respects things may have been slowed down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that quite astonishing. The agreement was signed in March 1977, and between then and the announcement of the surcharge in April 1978—just over one year—there was no significant change in the tar yield structure of the market. Then the change was announced, and from the time of the announcement to date there has been a reduction in higher tar cigarettes from 15 per cent, to 3 per cent, of the cigarette market.<br><br>
I should have thought that the hon. Member for Reading, South might have drawn some conclusion from the coincidence of the announcement of the surcharge and the kind of cigarettes that were sold. I certainly see that connection, and I feel that the regulations that we have introduced, and our decision at the time of the Budget, have been fully justified by events.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure whether the Financial Secretary has finished. I asked him half a dozen questions about the details of how these regulations were supposed to work, and he has not at-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
tempted to answer any of them, except for a vague phrase about something not being covered by the regulations. I thought that the purpose of Committees such as this, and indeed of the consideration of statutory instruments, was to look into such details. That is what the House of Commons asked us to come here to do. The Financial Secretary has tried to brush it off. He has not undertaken to write to me. He has said nothing about the matter and he has taken no notice at all of any of the half dozen points which I made in that connection.<br><br>
The only question of mine which the right hon. Gentleman did attempt to answer—and that was only after I pressed him in an intervention—was whether it was legal for the Government to introduce paragraph 7 of the schedule. All he said was "Oh yes, it's legal. It's in the Act." As I tried to make clear in my initial remarks, I cannot find where in the Act it says that the Commissioners may determine the methods of testing the tar yield of cigarettes, except by statutory instrument. Paragraph 7 seems, to allow this. I can find nothing in the Act which in any way modifies section 1(2)(<i>a</i>) so as to permit the Commissioners to give themselves carte blanche, whether or not the industry wants it. It seems to me that the right hon. Gentleman should give a little more attention to that problem.<br><br>
Finally, the Financial Secretary has not attempted to explain in his summary, how the Laboratory of the Government Chemist is getting on with attempting to administer the tax, which it was never designed to do in the first place. I should be grateful if he would also give a little attention to that, before we move on to anything else.</span></p>
<p>11.21 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have details of the present workload of the Government Chemist. However, my information is that testing is going satisfactorily and that complaints are not being made about it. If the hon. Gentleman requires any further information about the Government Chemist, I shall be happy to give what assistance I can. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman if he so wishes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Cope) asked a number of detailed questions about the various items
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0164">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
of machinery used for testing cigarettes. If he wants such matters debated in this Committee I shall be happy to read out a couple of pages of information which I have. However, I do not think that that would be in anyone's interest. The hon. Gentleman's technical observations have been noted and if he wants further information I shall be happy to provide it. If he wishes me to read out what I have, I shall do so but I do not think that would be the best way to proceed. The important issue is the purpose behind the regulations. I think that that is what the hon. Gentleman really has at heart.<br><br>
The regulations were tied to an existing standard, so that United Kingdom law is changed when the ISO law is changed. Hence, any amendment to ISO 3402 of 1975 would, if relevant, be made by further regulations amending the regulations now before this Committee. That establishes the proper authority for the further changes about which the hon. Gentleman talked.<br><br>
I understand his interest in some of the details. If he thinks that this Committee is the right time to discuss the sizes and functions of the various instruments which are used, I do not. Such discussion is best undertaken by correspondence, which I should be pleased to enter into with the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p>11.23 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary knows that I try always to be as helpful as possible to him in Committee, during Finance Bills and in every other way. If he is prepared to write to me about the detailed points concerning both the Government Chemist and what he called the details of the machinery, I am happy for him to do that.<br><br>
However, on the legal point, I believe that he has slightly confused two of the bits of paper which he has recently received. I was pressing him to deal with the point that I raised on paragraph 7 of the schedule, where the Commissioners give themselves carte blanche to modify the regulations in future in respect of unusually sized or shaped cigarettes. Although I am an amateur in such matters, it is that which I find to be of doubtful legality. It is that for which there seems to be no provision in the Act and it is that about which I was pressing the right hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
However, the Minister dealt with an earlier question that I asked, but he had previously left unanswered. That question was what would be the result if the standard was modified, as I understand it is likely to be. I am interested to notice that, in future, British tax law can be modified by a decision of the International Standards Organisation. That, to my mind, is not a very acceptable arrangement. I should have thought that, particularly those in his own party who object to the involvement of, for example, the Common Market Commissioners, as well as others, in British law, would not be agreeable to British tax law being modified in future by the council of the ISO.</span></p>
<p>11.25 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the Minister's reply extremely surprising. The Minister is surely aware that the purpose of this Committee is to discuss the statutory instrument in some depth. We as members of this Committee expect to have a proper discussion. If the Minister is not properly briefed, and if he has simply read out the financial basis of the statutory instrument, it is disappointing that he has not done his homework. But maybe he is a busy man, and we would quite understand it if he said to us "I don't know the answer to those technical questions. I shall write to the hon. Member and to any other hon. Members who are interested". That is the practice at the Department of the Environment as his right hon. Friend the Minister of State will know. That was what happened whenever we discussed any matter concerning the environment. It is perfectly normal and acceptable. But it is totally unsatisfactory and extremely arrogant for him to stand up and not to answer any of the questions that my hon. Friend raised, and then to say arbitrarily that if the hon. Gentleman wants to know, maybe he will write to him.</span></p>
<p>11.26 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) came rather late to the Committee this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One minute late.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying how late. I am just mentioning a fact with which the hon. Gentleman now concurs,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0165">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
and I am glad to hear his concurrence. The hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Cope) asked a number of questions, and I said that I would write to him. I shall take this matter up in correspondence. I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman tries to leap to his hon. Friend's defence. I can assure him that the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South needs no assistance in these matters.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South has misunderstood what I said. I tried to make clear that paragraph 7 of the schedule is a concessionary paragraph. I thought that he would accept that willingly, because he knows full well that in a number of fiscal areas concessions are made, so that where a particular instrument has prejudicial effects on the taxpayer, there are certain offsetting reliefs. This is one such. I shall read it out. It is purely a concession.
<br><blockquote><p>"Where owing to abnormality in the shape"—</p></blockquote>
which is normally regarded as referring to the oval shape—
<br><blockquote><p>"size or construction of any cigarettes the procedure set out in paragraphs 1 to 5 above is in any way inappropriate it"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the procedure—
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be applied in respect of those cigarettes with such modifications as the Commissioners after consultation with the Government Chemist and the manufacturer or importer shall specify".</p></blockquote>
So the manufacturer or importer approaches the Commissioners makes a complaint or representation that they are being unfairly treated in this way. Rather than binding them by regulations and preventing them from doing anything about it, their representations will be listened to. Surely that is the right way to proceed. Does anyone disagree with that as a proper basis of consultations in unusual circumstances? I think that that is the right way to proceed. It is the way that most fiscal matters do work, and I feel that that provision should stay.</span></p>
<p>11.28 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I opened this debate I made two major points directly relating to the regulations. One was the allegation that there had been a breach of understanding, perhaps a breach of faith between the industry and the Gov-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
ernment. The other was that the regulations are faulty. The Minister has not been able to answer these points. Those are the questions which my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, South, has been asking. The schedule, in the opinion of many people, is faulty.<br><br>
I understand the problems faced by the Minister in dealing with this matter. It is a highly technical subject. I suggest, to save further embarrassment, that, instead of reading out chunks of brief—which I now see him turning over rather anxiously—he should give a clear undertaking to the Committee that he will look into the matter and answer the points raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave an undertaking that I would reply. I am still willing to read out all this stuff. The Committee would not be fascinated by it. I shall certainly enter into correspondence, as I announced earlier, with the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Cope) to deal with his points about machinery. Some of the machinery is copied from that produced on the continent of Europe. There are some interesting observations which I could make. I shall be happy to answer by correspondence any questions which the hon. Gentleman may care to put to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall look forward to my post with even greater eagerness.<br><br>
I was surprised as the Financial Secretary's remarks about paragrah 7 of the schedule. He said that this was a concession. But nothing in the schedule says that the amount of tax will be decreased. It may be a change which is not a concession but which involves a higher tax or something with which the industry disagrees. It may have the effect of increasing the tax by changing the methods of assessment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find this hard to understand, as the point was put in specifically at the request of the trade. It would be surprising that the trade should ask for such a paragraph to be inserted if it felt it to be detrimental to itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The trade must make its own decisions, but the tax law is not decided by the trade. It is decided by the House. The Financial Secretary says that concessions are a regular part of the management of the tax machinery. I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0166">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
sure that I understand that nearly as well as he does. I know about the booklets dealing with extra-statutory concessions—miners' coal and so on—that pour out from the Inland Revenue and other Departments from time to time. But this purports to be a statutory provision, made in paragraph 7 of the schedule. If it is, it must be legal. My question had nothing to do with whether it was desirable. My original question, which I repeated several times, was "Is this legal under the Act?"<br><br>
As I have tried to explain several times, I cannot see where the Act permits a statutory provision of this kind, though I appreciate that, in all taxation matters, there are some extra-statutory arrangements which it is necessary for Customs and Excise to make, and no doubt this is one of them. If it is to be a statutory matter, it must have statutory backing. I am not sure—to put it no more strongly—whether statutory backing for paragraph 7 of the schedule is in the Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly repeat what I said on this matter. If the hon. Gentleman will read the <i>Official Report</i> of these transactions tomorrow, if it is available, he will see that I gave the exact way in which this provision was made statutory, because it is dependent on the Finance Act 1978.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Medicines (Advertising to Medical and Dental Practitioners) Regulations 1978 (S.I., No. 1020).</p></blockquote>
It may please the Committee to hear that we expect to be very brief on these regulations. Our anxiety over them is similar in one respect to our anxiety over the previous regulations. Once again, certain sections of the industries involved feel that they have been let down by the Government—if I may put it as mildly as that—and that there has been a breach
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
of understanding, if not of faith, between them.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical industry is a major industry which makes a major contribution to the country's economy. By any standards it has been an outstanding success in export markets recently. The industry has been steadily modifying the advertising of drugs, providing for more detailed information in advertisements and greater checks on the claims for various proprietary medicines. It is not surprising, therefore, that the industry feels let down and surprised when regulations of this kind are introduced. We are concerned—I will be frank about this—as to whether the regulations have been properly thought through.<br><br>
As the Committee will be aware, earlier this year we had a complete shambles over the labelling of medicines under the provisions of the Medicines Act. In fact, so appalling was the situation that the Government had to admit an error and delay the implementation of the regulations. Here again, we have what appears to be a well-intentioned but ill-thought out series of changes.<br><br>
We are concerned about the effect of these regulations on certain journals, and I would like the Minister to state categorically whether, in his view, there is a risk that certain journals will have to close down as a result of the regulations.<br><br>
We are particularly concerned about the effects of abbreviated advertisements. Our information is that these can lead to considerable difficulties. For example, in some journals, the advertiser will be restricted to two-thirds of a page in the journal, even if he wishes to take a full page, but will have to pay for a full page. Then there are problems over what will be inserted into the remainder of the page. Some journals, as the Minister knows, have a clear policy, for very good reasons, of not putting editorial content on the same page as major advertisements. These kinds of anxieties have led us to move this prayer and to ask the Minister to be a little more explicit as to the effects of the regulations.</span></p>

involved personally in any accounts for the pharmaceutical industry.<br><br>
I must express my disappointment that the Minister of State is here this morning rather than giving me a decision on the Creaton Hospital in Northamptonshire.<br><br>
As someone who has practiced in the industry for almost 15 years I, and others, recognise that the advertising of medicines has been controlled, legally and voluntarily, for many decades. This is not something new, and it is not something for which any particular party can claim credit.<br><br>
What does disturb me is first the apparent vendetta that has been waged by the Government in relation to certain medical journals, and, secondly, the nonsense of much of the detail of this statutory instrument. I have a number of detailed questions on which I seek guidance from the Minister. If he is not able to give it this morning perhaps he will do me the courtesy of writing to me.<br><br>
Article 4 is concerned with audiovisual advertisements. Can the Minister say what the position is for a company which, quite rightly, wishes to promote a product or substance—particularly a product—based on a case history? The Minister will be aware that at present most general practitioners—perhaps I ought to declare another interest here in that I am married to a general practitioner—are sent tapes of situations or problems that are common to a general practitioner or, if not common, perhaps relevant to specific problems. It is sometimes not uncommon for part of the talk to refer to a case history involving a particular brand. This is found to be useful and helpful to general practitioners and is an up-to-date means of communication.<br><br>
Article 5 may seem to be all-embracing, but as one who has worked for copywriters for many years, I think that they will treat it as a challenge to their ingenuity.<br><br>
Article 8 (<i>d</i>) concerns the time limit of the word "new". I ask the Minister to think very hard about this. The Minister will know that a number of pharmaceutical companies do not necessarily initially launch their products on a national basis. It is not uncommon for a pharmaceutical company, or any com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
mercial company, to carry out a limited marketing operation to test the product. That could be either because its own distribution arrangements are limited, or because it wants to see, despite checks throughout the progress of the product, what happens in the market place before putting down a major investment. The Government are being unduly restrictive in their requirement that any product that has been on the market, even on a test basis, for up to a year can no longer be launched as "new" in another part of the country. That is totally unrealistic and I hope that reconsideration will be given to that aspect.<br><br>
Article 10 (<i>a</i>), and with it Article 10 (<i>c</i>), concerns multi-page advertisements. Double page spreads in the advertising industry are not constructed in two separate halves. They are constructed as a single advertisement to communicate a particular message to the readers. It is totally unrealistic for a statutory instrument to declare that no multi-page advertisement shall be issued if one part of it is misleading if read in isolation. That is taking matters to absurd lengths. Whoever produced this part of the regulations knows very little of the advertising industry and how it works.<br><br>
In paragraph 3 of the schedule great play is made of the relationship of type size to the name of the product. If we have time later I can produce for the Minister a type size which would be considerably less legible than a type size two sizes smaller. It is the category of type which is just as important. If the Minister wanted to do a thorough job he should have suggested exactly what characters should be used, as well as the size. This demonstrates yet again the absurdity of the Government becoming involved in this area.<br><br>
I have no objection to Government making requirements for licence numbers, for graphs, and for the detail of the product and its side effects. That is logical, and the industry itself, in its code of conduct, is more than ready to accept that. But all the Minister is doing in these regulations is inviting the ingenuity of the advertising industry to pull out benefits that he may or may not wish to see. It is distressing that the Government should get into these areas. The question of type sizes is not one with which the Government should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0168">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
involved. It is the visual presentation alongside the copy that makes the totality of the communication. Whoever wrote these regulations clearly does not understand what communication is about, or how it works.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can reply to these important points I have raised. The most important is that concerning the period of one year relating to new products. I can see that as being a major constricting factor on the marketing of pharmaceutical products in the future.</span></p>
<p>11.44 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not declare any interest in the matter, unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris), who knows so much more about it than I do. However, I feel that in such circumstances it is not always a question of gain. There is also a considerable loss in the balance sheet arising from introducing a measure such as this. The gain may be to ensure that the truth really comes out in an advertisement and that nobody is bamboozled by a slick advertisement into buying a product which is not safe or does not do what it is said to do. We are out to have advertisements which do not distort the truth.<br><br>
Neverthless, these regulations—immensely complicated as they are—will add to the cost of the research and development of products that come on to the market. It cannot avoid doing so. Are we not, once again, putting a spoke in the wheel of companies and research workers who are trying to put improved pharmaceutical products on the market, and to do so at a reasonable cost? They will find that such regulations as these make it much more expensive to do that. It is expensive to market a product through advertising, and unless a product is marketed all the cost of research and all the effort to make a better product is of no account.<br><br>
To echo what my hon. Friends have said, I say that there is a vendetta by the Government against the pharmaceutical industry. In the Government's view, it is wrong for the industry to make profits from selling pharmaceuticals. That is basically what it comes down to. However, unless some profit is made by the industry, we shall not advance in medi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
cine in the way that has been done in the past.<br><br>
The Government may feel that there is nothing but gain in producing regulations such as these, but I suggest to the Committee that there is another side to the balance sheet. There is a hindrance to the development and marketing of such products, some of which will prove beneficial in the long run to the patients for whom they are intended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Mr. Roland Moyle)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity of discussing this legislation in Committee. I share the desire of the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan) to discuss the measure briefly. This is an opportunity for the Government to place their thinking on record. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will bear with me while I set out some of the considerations which moved us to produce the regulations and to enter into the sphere of the control of pharmaceutical advertising in the manner that we have.<br><br>
Before I do so, however, I hope that you, Mr. Watkins, will indulge me a little. The hon. Member for Reading, South was allowed briefly to wander away from the strict subject matter of the regulations and to allude to the Medicines (Prescriptions Only) Order 1977, which was placed before the House last year and dealt with labelling. He made a series of wild and unsubstantiated remarks about the order, which I must rebut.<br><br>
He said that the order was withdrawn because the Government recognised their error. This is not so. The pharmacists' organisations had failed—either by inadvertence or by design—to afford their members information with regard to the order, which had been before their negotiators and their leaders for some years. Nevertheless, we felt that it was important that that people involved should realise what was going on, and so we voluntarily withdrew the order, rather than enforce it with an uneducated profession, so as to allow the process of education to take place.<br><br>
Returning to the subject matter before us today, I notice that the quality of the speech of the hon. Member for Reading, South improved slightly with regard to these regulations when he went on to say not that the pharmaceutical journals
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0169">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
and the pharmaceutical industry had been misled, but merely that some members of them had been misled. Of course, in any collective body there is always a majority and a minority. I am happy to say that what we are doing here this morning has the agreement of the majority of the editors, the pharmaceutical journalists and the majority of companies who are members of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. Indeed, one of the journals—the <i>General Practitioner</i>—speaking of our debate this morning said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Publishers of medical journals are dismayed at the further questioning of rules which they believed to be an acceptable compromise between themselves, the industry and the Government."</p></blockquote>
Nevertheless, I exonerate Tory Members of causing alarm and despondency. They have every right to question these matters in debate, and it does give the Government an opportunity to state the thinking behind these moves.<br><br>
Medicines have been called, with justification, the poisons which heal. This is the essence of what we are dealing with this morning. Does a particular medicine prescribed in the particular circumstances of the case do more harm than good or more good than harm? A general practitioner should have full medical information available to enable him to make the right decision when he has to prescribe a drug. Otherwise damage could be done to his patients. This could happen if these regulations and this policy were not adopted.<br><br>
Since the Second World War the number of medicines available to prescribers has increased dramatically. To reach a balanced decision when prescribing a general practitioner requires first, a precise indication of the purpose for which a medicine has been licensed for marketing, second, information of contraindications and third an indication of possible adverse reactions.<br><br>
With that end in view and to assist general practitioners in that laudable aim a committee of inquiry into the relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and the National Health Service was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Sainsbury more than a decade ago. The committee reported in 1967. What it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
discovered which was interesting from the point of view of this Committee was that over 50 per cent, of practitioners regarded advertisements in medical journals and literature sent out by companies as their best source of information about medicines. That meant that there were a large number of practitioners who obtained their information from other sources, but the figure of 50 per cent, shows a heavy reliance by the profession on advertisements in pharmaceutical journals. Furthermore, the Royal College of General Practitioners described literature sent to doctors by companies at that time as
<br><blockquote><p>"bad, with inaccurate claims, lack of contraindications and good references, lack of price information".</p></blockquote>
Hospital authorities had joined the Royal College by saying that their experience of advertising at that time was of:
<br><blockquote><p>"highly coloured advertising matter, reminiscent of detergent propaganda, which advocates the use of a drug but gives little or no information of dosage, action and reactions".</p></blockquote>
The Medicines Commission, which was set up in 1969, considered the Sainsbury report and recommended ways of improving the quality of the promotion of medicinal products. My predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen) decided that the best way of tightening up on the situation, in the light of the Sainsbury report and the Medicines Commission's recommendations, would be by a combination of improved statutory and voluntary controls. I must say that I had little difficulty in following this policy when I succeeded him about two years ago. Interested parties were advised of my predecessor's views, and a draft agreement was drawn up between my Department and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, which is the basis for the legislation we are now discussing. The following arrangements were worked out. First, there would be statutory controls to deal with the information which was to appear in advertisements and to impose general requirements about advertisements, such as the prominence to be given to certain parts of the specified information, the prohibition of certain words and expressions and the prohibition of misleading graphs and tables.<br><br>
In its turn—this, I think, is what the hon. Member for Northampton, South
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0170">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
(Mr. Morris) possibly missed in his questions and his consideration of the regulations—the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry agreed to strengthen its code of advertising practice. It is not possible to give sensible consideration to the regulations unless one also bears in mind that they are supported by a code of practice. The association decided to appoint independent members to its Code of Practice Committee to examine a sample of published advertisements on a continuing basis, and to refer apparent breaches of the code to its Code of Practice Committee. The code would provide that no advertisements would be issued by a member company unless it had been certified as satisfactory by two approved signatories, one of whom would be a doctor. The ABPI agreed that the provisions of the code of practice on representatives' visits would be strengthened, and that doctors would not normally be visited more than three times a year on average. Representatives' briefing material would be subject to the same certification scheme as other advertisements. Additionally, a system of accreditation of representatives would be introduced, based on an examination or the possession of an approved qualification. The provisions on samples would also be tightened up. Pharmaceutical companies which were not members of the association would be invited to subscribe to the code and to accept the jurisdiction of the Code of Practice Committee. I hope that they will do so. We have implemented our side of the agreement in making these regulations, and the ABPI has implemented its side by the revised code of practice which was recently approved and adopted by its member companies.<br><br>
There are weaknesses in relying on a voluntary scheme. One is that a number of pharmaceutical companies are not members of the ABPI. We have to rely on the ABPI to persuade them to become part of the general machinery. There are no enforceable sanctions against a recalcitrant minority if one relies entirely on voluntary action. No action can be taken until a complaint is made and upheld. Meanwhile considerable damage may have been done because medicines can affect patients' lives and health. If a voluntary code is provided with a certain amount of statutory backing in areas
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
of fundamental importance, much of its weakness is removed and consistent standards are ensured.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a real sanction available to the industry which has not been used in the past in the pharmaceutical industry, namely for the publication to refuse to accept advertisements from member companies which refuse to abide by the code. That has been done in other industries. I see no reason why it should not be done in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry does not decide whether to accept advertisements. It is the editors of the journals, and particularly the technical journals, who do that, and they are not members of the ABPI. So a code of practice adopted by the association is not completely watertight. That is why is was decided to introduce the regulations.<br><br>
Officials of my Department have been monitoring advertisements for medicinal products. I shall give one example. I have others if the Committee is interested. I shall not give any names. An advertisement for a powerful medicine suggested that it could be used as an ordinary tonic in convalescence. The product in question is one which may be used after serious, debilitating illnesses to build up bone and muscle structure. There are hazards associated with its use, and it is not one which should be used indiscriminately after mild illnesses. There was no reference anywhere in the advertisement to the hazards, or possible side effects. The regulations are intended to prevent advertisements such as that.<br><br>
Although it makes sound sense to emphasise the good points of a particular drug in advertising, we are dealing not with ordinary commercial considerations but with the lives and health of patients. This must be taken into account. We are not selling detergents or television sets.<br><br>
I turn now to the regulations. First, they require that advertisements must contain certain specified information—such as the active ingredients, information as to use, dosage associated with the product, major side effects, contra-indications and warnings. Further, except for journals with a substantial circulation outside the United Kingdom—we estimate that about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0171">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
15 per cent, of journals will come into this category—there must be reference to the cost to the National Health Service. This refutes the point made by the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen), that the cost of drugs coming on to the market will be increased in price as a result of these regulations. The regulations will ensure that the medical profession is provided with comprehensive information about the cost of drugs. I know that the medical profession as a body is anxious to ensure that, as well as an effective drug being prescribed, it is prescribed in its cheapest form. This will free resources which can be devoted to medical care.<br><br>
All the side effects, contra-indications and warnings have to be placed on a data sheet for the product concerned—that is, a fact sheet containing full information about the product, which must be supplied to practitioners before a product is advertised to them.<br><br>
We agreed on all that with regard to major advertisements. Then the industry told us that it wanted to continue to publish some advertisements—referred to in the regulations as "abbreviated advertisements"—which would not have to carry all this mass of information. The Government agreed, with considerable reluctance that smaller, abbreviated advertisements with reduced information could be published following up a major advertisement of a drug.<br><br>
Some reassurance was provided by the inclusion in the agreement of a provision that abbreviated advertisements would occupy somewhat less than a full page in an appropriate technical journal. It came as some surprise to us, having made that concession, that the industry then thought that an advertisement which covered only 99 per cent, of the appropriate page would be regarded as less than a full page. It was not prepared to wear that one at all. We have now agreed that the size of such advertisement should be not more than 420 square centimetres. We discussed this with editors of the technical journals. Our original proposal was for A5 size advertisements but they said that that would cause difficulties in some journals. So we increased the size to 420 square centimetres, which is regarded as acceptable.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
Abbreviated advertisements must contain adequate information about the product and there is no reason to suppose that this information need appear out of proportion to the rest of the advertisement, or make it seem unbalanced.<br><br>
I have always been prepared to consider larger follow-up advertisements if the information they contained was confined to no more than the name of the product and the name of the promoter. But the industry has not been prepared to accept this, and therefore we have settled on the 420 square centimetres solution. It is, however, still open to the industry to take the alternative.<br><br>
Regulations require that the generic name of the product—that is, the nonproprietary name—should appear close to the brand name in a minimum type size of 10 point to ensure legibility. This was agreed because generic names are used in medical education and are also used, as a matter of policy, by leading medical journals in their articles. It is, therefore, desirable that prescribers should be aware of the generic name of the product, and we have assured that.<br><br>
Another requirement is that the cost to the National Health Service should be shown in the advertisements.<br><br>
Reverting to the question of the 420 square centimetre size, the hon. Member for Northampton, South asked how journals were to accommodate this. I am pretty confident that there is no problem posed for journals which cannot be solved either by good advertising copy-writing, by good editing, or by a good commercial approach. <i>The British Medical Journal,</i> for example accepts abbreviated advertisements. I have in fact seen one example in the <i>Journal</i> of an advertisement covering three-quarters of a page with a subsidiary advertisement relating to another product filling the rest of the page. This has apparently been accepted by the two companies concerned and is accepted by the editor as appropriate. I expect no insoluble problems with other journals.<br><br>
We have reached agreement with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry and the journals on these requirements. There are, therefore, no major disagreements between ourselves and the leaders of these two groups,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0172">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
although, as the hon. Member for Reading, South said, there may be odd minority groups within them who are not happy with what their leaders have done. We are all familiar with such situations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has spent most of his speech—which has been helpful to the Committee because, as he appreciates, this was a probing motion—on aspects of the pharmaceutical industry. I can understand why. May I take it, therefore, that he has had no major representations from the publishers regarding difficulties on these regulations? May I also assume that the example I gave of the difficulties of an abbreviated advertisement, where the advertiser would have to pay for a whole page although only using part of it, has not proved to be a difficulty?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that there have not been discussions. Clearly the natural reaction of an editor of a paper is that he must have total freedom to advertise just when he wishes, to whom he wishes and in the form he wishes.<br><br>
I am happy to say, however, that broadly speaking the technical press, once we put our worries to it about the quality of advertising in its publications and the impact that it was making on the medical profession, accepted our move in the spirit in which we made it. There has obviously been give and take and discussion, and at one stage some of the worries that the hon. Gentleman described were expressed at meetings between representatives of the editors and officials in my Department. But all those technical details were solved at that level, and at no stage on that issue did the editors of the journals ask to see me.<br><br>
There was a proposal in relation to the code of practice which my predecessor made some two or three years ago—the details of which escape me at the moment—which caused the editors of the journals some concern and they saw me about it. But we dropped the proposal and adopted a different approach, which the editors of the journals did not seek to discuss with me.<br><br>
I know of no reason why the regulations should cause journals to close down. The process that I have described was based on an agreement. If journals felt that their future was in danger they would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
have been in grave doubt as to whether they should have gone along with them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Northampton, South raised a number of points. First, as regards companies which wish to promote a product audio-visually on a case history basis, this is quite in order. They must, though, supply data sheets to accompany such audio-visual presentations. Companies who want to promote a product should not be too worried by the regulations but should turn to. the appropriate provision of the ABPI code of practice. If they conform to that I can see very little danger of them being hauled before the courts.<br><br>
I deal now with the question of what is a new drug. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the definition which we have in the regulations. In so far as it relates to the regulations, the definition would be a matter for interpretation by the courts. It would be pointless if I sought to give the courts any guidance. As the hon. Gentleman knows, courts are not cognisant of our proceedings here. We have merely reproduced a phrase in the ABPI code of practice. The ABPI will decide what is a new drug in terms of the code of practice.<br><br>
Turing to the subject of multiple-page advertisements, all the regulations that we have introduced are designed to ensure that multi-page advertisements are read as one and not as two separate advertisements. We feel that there is a need for that. The hon. Member for Northampton, South said that the regulations would be a challenge to the ingenuity of advertisers. I always resist legislation in situations of this kind on exactly those grounds. If one can obtain a voluntary agreement, it is likely to be more flexible and effective in practice than legislation. As hon. Members on both sides of the Committee must know, regulations automatically mean loopholes, and loopholes can be got through. That is why I stress that it is important to bear in mind that the regulations are a long-stop, and that we have a wicket keeper in the form of the voluntary ABPI code of practice. I suspect that most of our problems will be solved there.<br><br>
I have dealt with the cost of drugs coming on the market—a topic raised by the hon. Member for Wells. He said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0173">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
that we took the view that it was wrong for the pharmaceutical industry to make profits. I may say that we have a scheme known as the pharmaceutical pricing regulation scheme, whereby we meet the pharmaceutical companies every year, look;at their balance sheets and agree with them the rate of profit that those companies should earn over the ensuing 12 months. I think that that effectively disposes of contention.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
There may be other points that I have not covered. I hope not. Ji there are, I shall do my best to answer them later.</span></p>
