	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Guy Barnett)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee have considered the New Towns (Limit on Borrowing) Order 1979.</p></q>
As I look round at the composition of the Committee, I realise that it is perhaps unnecessary to remind the Committee that it is necessary to come to the House every so often to increase the limit on the amount of money which can be lent to new towns. The last increase was in the New Towns Act 1977. That provided £500 million extra immediately and a further £500 million as and when approved by the House. We expected to start drawing on that authorisation in the autumn of 1977 and thought that both tranches would be used up in a little over two years. That is to say, we would have expected coming back with a completely new Bill next autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the event, the new towns have been requiring public investment funds more slowly than we expected in 1977. Instead of the £40 million a month we predicted, the actual rate has been nearer £30 million. The first £500 million authorised under the 1977 Act is now only expected to be fully drawn next month, and the second £500 million, which the order now before us would approve, should last until late summer 1980. We will therefore need to introduce a new money Bill in either the first or the second session of the next Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking to the future, we expect expenditure by new towns to remain at about present levels for the next two or three years and then gradually to fall away as towns complete their programmes. New towns need these resources, of course, for constructing roads and sewers and building houses, factories, shops, offices and so on. In the last financial year, 61 per cent, went on housing, 15 per cent, on roads and 23 per cent, on industrial and commercial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
There have been two main reasons, I think, for the slowing down in investment by the new towns. First, new towns, like the rest of the public sector, have been affected by general Government restraint on public expenditure. Secondly—in this case more significantly—there has recently been a considerable increase in private investment in new towns. This applies both to industrial and commercial development, where the financial institutions have been playing an increasing role, and to housing, where substantial numbers of private houses have recently been completed on land made available for development corporations. In the year to November 1978 in the English new towns, 3,763 starts and 2,820 completions were made by private enterprise as against 5,203 starts and 5,985 completions by the new towns themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the programmes of the third generation towns building up to a peak and the other development corporations hard at work putting the finishing touches to their programmes before they are dissolved, the demand for resources for new town industrial and commercial development has now reached a high level. As I am sure hon. Members are well aware, resources are now under particular pressure. We have not been able to provide the increased resources necessary to keep investment at the level which new towns would like. To help fill the gap, we have been encouraging greater private participation in the funding of industrial and commercial development. We now expect that more than half this programme will be privately financed in 1979–80 compared with about 22 per cent, for the current year. To augment the forward funding arrangements by which financial institutions have in the past participated, we approved last year a limited amount of "rollover" of completed industrial and commercial buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rollover will be permitted in those cases where the funds raised can with advantage be used for the continuing development of the town. For 1979–80 we think that towns might be able to raise as much as £65 million by forward funding and rollover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, however, limitations on the use of private finance in new towns. For one thing, by no means all of it is in the industrial and commercial programme. It also includes landscaping, amenities, vehicles, workshops and so on, which are suitable for private funding. Also, while
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
private investment in our new towns is undoubtedly a sign of confidence, the Committee will recognise that it will have the effect of reducing the rental income of the corporations and this in time could affect their ability to repay the loans made to them for non-housing development. An adequate level of income is essential to the viability of the towns and this clearly sets a limit on the amount of private finance new towns can accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the role of private funding in new towns, however, we are still talking about very considerable sums of Government money in the present order. I know that the Committee will want to be assured that this money is being well spent and that new towns offer a sound investment. If we look first at new towns strictly in terms of financial success, there can in my view be no doubt that corporations and the Commission have managed very well, often in increasingly difficult circumstances. An investment programme of the size with which we are concerned cannot expect to produce its financial returns in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1977–78 the Commission made a surplus of £2 million, and four of the first generation towns made surpluses ranging from £200,000 to £900,000. At the end of the day new towns will have paid all the interest due and redeemed all their capital borrowing, and we shall still have a considerable accumulation of capital assets to generate further income. That in itself is no mean achievement, but we must also bear in mind the context in which that achievement has been made. New towns have, for instance, always borne many costs not normally incurred by other developers. They make substantial contributions to the costs of items such as roads and sewerage incurred by local and public authorities. Unlike local authorities, new towns receive no grants other than housing subsidies. Virtually all new town expenditure is financed by long term borrowing at current market rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the scale of development, there is now a total popultion of about 2 million. Over 400,000 new dwellings. 700 new schools, over 17 million square metres of factory space and 1 million square metres of office space have been constructed. Total employment in new towns is now over 1 million, and new town development corporations have been conspicuously successful in the attraction of new firms to their towns, many of them
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
from overseas. Corporations have made major contributions to modern urban planning and architecture and have created an environment which combines functional efficiency with visual attractiveness. In short, our new towns have won an international reputation for their social, economic and aesthetic achievements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Demands and priorities, however, inevitably change with time, and the new towns programme has proved flexible enough to adapt to new situations. At the end of the last war when the Government's new town programme was just getting off the ground, the country's population was growing rapidly and the major conurbations were in many cases grossly overcrowded. Now, as I am sure hon. Members are well aware, many regions expect a drop in population and the conurbations are facing real difficulties in maintaining the vitality needed to redevelop their existing fabric. To meet this situation, our 1977 new town review substantially reduced the long term population targets of the six most recently designated towns. We also announced at that time that 11 of the development corporations of the earlier towns would be dissolved in the early 1980s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must not be assumed from these changes that the new towns, like Lewis Carroll's boojum hunters, will softly and suddenly vanish away and never be met with again. On the contrary, new towns have a continuing and valuable role to play for a number of years to come in providing an environment in which people and industry can thrive. There is still a great deal of work necessary to complete the towns currently under development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the first and second generation towns, there is still plenty of rounding off to be done before the corporations are dissolved and assets transferred. The Commission for the New Towns has a major task ahead of it in deciding how it will manage and develop the large industrial and commercial estates which it will soon be inheriting. In addition towns such as Central Lancashire, Warrington and Northampton are becoming increasingly involved in the essential work of urban renewal and are completing the circle by moving from their traditional task of • rehousing people and industry on new sites to that of bringing back into acceptable conditions areas from which this movement started in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members will agree with me that the new town development
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
corporations must be allowed to continue to press ahead with their development programmes. Even with the recent growth of private investment in new towns, public investment is indispensable. In my view, money made available by Parliament to the towns still represents an excellent social and financial investment for the nation I therefore commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the benefits of this kind of Committee and the need to renew an order is that it enables the Government—in this instance the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment— to give a broad review of the position by new towns. This is one area on which, in terms of broad strategy, there is all-party agreement, although there are differences of emphasis. A review of policy over the last five years shows that at least the new towns are dynamic organisations and are meeting a changing scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to look at some of the implications of what the Under-Secretary said and question him on his introductory remarks and matters arising from the Government's White Paper on expenditure plans. This order is a small piece of paper, but it has significant implications for existing new towns. Before we grant money on this scale, I feel that we should press the Government for clarification on some points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, as the Under-Secretary will recall, we used to increase the amount of money in tranches of £250 million. We then changed the policy—presumably in the light of inflation—and increased the amount to £500 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the slowing down of the rate of growth of existing new towns, the fact that the majority of new towns are now coming to fruition, and even the third generation new towns have revised targets, and in the light of the increased inflow of private capital, the question arises whether Parliament should revert to tranches of £250 million to give us an opportunity to appraise the situation on a more regular basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we ought to look at what is portrayed in the Government's White Paper on expenditure. There are two points that I should like to raise concerning Command 7439. On page 97 there is a reference to the number of permanent new
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
dwellings approved. New Towns, local authorities and housing associations are listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that there has been a steady fall-off in the approval of dwellings in new towns since 1975. In 1976, 14,300 dwellings were approved; in 1977, 9,700 were approved; and, if I heard the Under-Secretary correctly, just over 5,200 were approved for 1978. This fall-off in the provision of public rented accommodation by new towns is similar to the fall-off in the provision of public rented accommodation by local authorities and underlines the unfairness of the charge that has been made on the Floor of the House that, for political reasons, some local authorities are cutting back on public sector housing. The Government have direct control of the rate of output, and we see a fall-off there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could give a forecast of the target number of approved dwellings for the new towns over the next three years. If he cannot do so this morning, perhaps he could let members of the Committee know in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I turn to table 2.7 on pages 90 and 91, which again refers to housing, and in particular to the passages on capital expenditure. The reference is:
	<br><q><p>"Subsidies to new Towns and Scottish Special Housing Association".</p></q>
We see that expenditure in real terms has fallen between 1976–77 and 1978–79. We should expect that fall because of the review. What I find surprising is that an increase is forecast for 1979–80, and I wonder why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We note that we must go back to 1973–74 for the peak turnover of assets of £75 million. Since that time, under the present Government, the figure has been running at between £13 million and £18 million per annum. Unfortunately, the forecast figures are no longer separated for ensuing years. However, I see that total sales, which clearly include local authorities sales, are not expected to change. In the light of the Under-Secretary's statement that about £65 million was forecast to roll over in 1979–80, I wonder whether those figures are included in the White Paper. It seems, from the evidence before me, that they probably are not. I should be grateful for clarification on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to one or two aspects mentioned by the Under-Secretary. Housing takes the greatest volume of money. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
Minister knows that we have had discussions across the Chamber and in this Committee on an earlier occasion about the ratio of owner-occupied to rented properties. There is a difference of opinion between us, and it is distressing. I believe that the Minister is beginning to accept that informed opinion on housing in general— expressed, for instance, in Shelter's periodical 	<i>Roof,</i> in 	<i>Housing Review,</i> or in any of the other publications by people who take a genuine and non-party interest—is becoming worried that the new towns have an unduly large proportion of rented accommodation and a small proportion of owner-occupied accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is seen at its worst in Stevenage where the latest figures show that under 20 per cent, of accommodation is owner-occupied. Even in the expansion area of Northampton, only 19 per cent, of new dwellings are for owner occupation. We expect and hope that the Government will back up their present policy of a 50–50 ratio. What are they doing to ensure that the third generation new towns meet that ratio, because they have a long way to go?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Gentleman said about private development and the need for a balance in the new towns. Indeed I agree with much of what he said. But is he aware that in Peterborough—I am sure this is also true of Northampton—despite enormous efforts by the development corporations to make sites available and attract private developers, the private sector has consistently failed to take up the opportunities offered? The hon. Gentleman should not expect the results to come from my hon. Friend. More attention should be directed to persuading firms in the private sector to go where the opportunities are provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for me to comment on Peterborough. Certainly in Northampton—about which I can speak with more authority—there was a decline in private sector house-building. That was happening nationally as well as locally. However, it was not helped by the policy of the development corporation, supported by the Treasury, to sell land at a price way above the then ruling market price. That undoubtedly constrained private development during that crucial time. It is true that there is now some pick-up, but the pick-up is slower than in the market as a whole because of the pricing policy on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the time has come for the Government once again to think about the opportunity of giving people the automatic right to buy their properties when the new town assets are handed over to the local authorities. That, of course, applies not to the Peterborough development corporation or the Northampton development corporation, but to the earlier ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should remember that these properties were built not to help local needs, but primarily to help London's needs and other conurbations elsewhere in the country. There is no question of interfering with local authority demands, rights or needs. If 75 per cent, of people want to own their own homes, the point of transfer of assets is an ideal time at which to offer that possibility to sitting tenants. The Government do a grave disservice to the future of the first and second generation new towns by refusing to give those people the absolute opportunity to buy their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as the Minister knows, there is grave disquiet, in some of the earlier new towns about the condition of the properties on transfer and the financial burdens on those local authorities which are taking them over. That is not true in all cases, but it is true in some. It is particularly true of Corby in Northamptonshire, and I have read that it is a matter of concern to a number of other local authorities. Has the Minister any proposals for a review of the terms of transfer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning now to commercial assets, the Minister's remarks this morning were fairly illuminating. I believe that this is the first time that there has been a public statement that a substantial amount of private money has been brought in to assist the shortage of available money. That is greatly to be welcomed. We have been pressing the Government in that regard for many years. It is a shame that it has taken so long to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I sensed a certain reluctance on the Minister's part to take that matter too far. But there is an understanding on both sides of the House that there is a shortage of public money available for certain key needs. If there were an extra £100 million—all the evidence is that that money is there—and I had to decide whether it should go to the National Health Service or to new towns, I should have to say that if the money were available in the public sector to finance the rollover of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
assets we should be totally irresponsible not to redeploy those resources against the National Health Service. The Conservative Party has made it absolutely clear that commercial assets should be rolled over. I hope that those concerned have done the necessary preparatory work so that it can be implemented at an early stage after the change of Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for one or two of the specific matters. But, as the money is for the future, one or two further points arise. The first concerns the inner city partnership and the concept of what some of us colloquially call the "old town corporation". When I look at the borough where I used to work—the inner city partnership area of Islington and Hackney—and the development of dockland, I question why we do not use the concept of the new town machinery to better effect to solve the problems there. As we know, that machinery has worked. I wonder whether we shall ever tackle that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, is there any budgetary provision for supporting or promoting the export of the technique of the new towns? We have a unique pool of talent available to assist the Third World which, if skilfully deployed, could be of enormous benefit to British industry in terms of the follow through for British contractors and others. Is there any provision in the Budget fox such an extension?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Command 7439 is now totally out of date. The Government recognise that the options are difficult. They must either increase taxation, which will mean a switch from direct to indirect taxation, or make a substantial cut in public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having worked in the new town movement, I am concerned that the real benefits should not be lost. There has been a review and a slowing down. The Government could secure the future of the new towns if, instead of drifting—as they have for some time—they made positive moves, such as those I have suggested: the automatic right of sale on transfer to enable people to own their properties; the turning over, to a far greater degree, of commercial assets; and the use of the available expertise on the inner city problem as an invisible export.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stanley Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the order and to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the

Under-Secretary for the attention that he has paid to the new town movement since he took on his present responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new towns have been a successful venture, and public investment in a successful venture is always desirable. My hon. Friend mentioned the number of houses, schools, factories, offices and jobs created in the new towns. In many respects success has been achieved in creating growth points from which new industries and all kinds of new activities can be launched. It would be dangerous to move away from the concept of the new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success achieved in many of the new towns has not been characteristic of industry in general If it had been, this country would have had a far more successful economic record over the past decade or two than has been achieved. Therefore, we must strongly support the order to provide a new sum for investment in the new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that money available for new town investment is not unlimited. I welcome the fact that private funds are available. The fact that investors are prepared to put their own money into new towns is a testimony to their success. None the less, it must be recognised that much of the development that is necessary, particularly in the younger new towns, cannot possibly be carried out by private investment alone. As much of the development is infrastructure, we must strongly support the case for further public investment in new towns. Therefore, I welcome the decision that we are to take this morning I hope that, in welcoming it, we can make it clear that we do not believe that it will be possible in future, despite recent trends, to taper off the level of public investment in new towns beyond a certain level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many aspects of new town development which it will not be possible to carry out if we rely on private investment. In those circumstances, I believe that, in the foreseeable future, we must be prepared to make available large sums of public money for new town development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, even in the older new towns, there is much rounding off to be done. Therefore, any cutting off of funds would be a severe blow. But, in the younger new towns, the cutting off of money would be even more devastating. Indeed, much of the investment which has already been carried out would be lost if further public money were not forthcoming. I represent one of the older new

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
towns. Therefore, I am not putting forward a narrow constituency view in making that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, it would not be desirable, as the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) said, to cut the size of the tranche when these orders come before us. We should recognise that inflation has taken its toll. Therefore, it is desirable, that, when we make these orders, we see that sufficient money is made available for people to take a long term view of new town development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Northampton, South noted the principle of making available public funds. In that sense, there is no basic division between the parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northampton, South raised the issue of private housing. I believe that it would be unfortunate if we did not recognise that part of the great success of new towns has been derived, from the provision of houses to rent. If houses had not been available to rent, many of the people living in the older towns would not have gone to the new towns. We must recognise that by and large, people living in London and older towns left their original homes not because they wanted new jobs, but because they were unable to find suitable housing accommodation where they lived. Such accommodation could be obtained only in the new towns. Without the provision of houses to rent in the first place, those new towns could not have got off the ground. The provision of large numbers of houses to rent was vital to their success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not really arguing that basic point. I was making two points. The first was that the majority of people now want to own their own homes. We know that from many sources. I am saying that the Government should provide them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in the third generation of new towns we now have too much rented accommodation. There are nearly 600 empty properties in Northampton for rent and there are excessive numbers in Milton Keynes. I believe there are substantial numbers in Peterborough, too. The whole position has become askew. That was the point that I was making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced that is so. I should not object to providing houses for sale. I bought and live in a house in Harlow. The Harlow development cor-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
poration, as part of its policy from an early stage, built certain houses expressly for sale to members of the public who wished to buy them. I strongly defend that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that many people wish to buy their own houses, and their requirements should be met. I have not found anyone—either coming to my advice bureau or writing to me—who has not been able to find a house for sale. In fact, according to the estate agent and the newspapers, there are plenty of houses for sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find—and I am sure this is the experience of the majority of hon. Members who represent new towns—that I get a continual stream of letters from and visits to my advice bureau by people who say " I cannot afford to buy. I need an accommodation. I want a place to rent." Those waiting lists must be dealt with first. We must provide housing for people who cannot afford to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an express duty to tackle the housing problem. We cannot fail to recognise that the real need in the community today is the provision of accommodation to rent. Until that state of affairs is reversed, I am not prepared to agree that the situation is askew, as was suggested by the hon. Member for Northampton, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also commented on the sale of commercial assets. We must recognise that public property is bought with public money. It would be wrong to sell off assets without recognising our responsibility to the public, whose funds have been invested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see why, as a matter of principle, the public should dispose of profitable assets. There may be arguments for the sale of particular assets. I am not laying down the principle that we should never sell off assets. But it is clear that unprofitable assets are not saleable. Why should we sell off profitable assets and leave new town corporations or their successors with unprofitable assets? If that were the case, hon. Members who take the same view as the hon. Member for Northampton, South would claim that public enterprises never make profits. The Harlow development corporation has been an extremely successful public enterprise. I do not think that its success, even in commercial terms, has been fully recognised. It would be wrong to wind up the development corporations and to sell all the profitable assets, leaving only the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
unprofitable assets to their successors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite some disagreements on these issues, which I feel I have a right to air, I am delighted that there is agreement on both sides of the Committee to the grant of this money. I wholeheartedly approve of the order. I believe that it is important for us to ensure that demands for cuts in public expenditure in future do not ruin the success of the new towns. Therefore, I take great pleasure in supporting the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.8 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only a few sentences to add to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens), because he has covered much of the ground that I would have covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to add my tribute to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, who has an enormous grasp of the problems and policies of new towns, and has brought a great deal of enthusiasm to this area since his appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to accept that there is an overwhelming demand amongst new town tenants to purchase their own property. They started as tenants and usually had the option to purchase, but they have preferred not to do so. I appreciate that 75 per cent, would in general prefer to own their own property—I suppose that most women would prefer to own a mink coat, if they were given the option—but, in the circumstances, they have accepted tenancy arrangements. In my experience, new towns flourish and prosper when there is a thorough mix of property available both for rent and purchase. That has been the case in the Central Lancashire new town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is wise to work to the £500 million tranche rather than £250 million, though the inflation that has taken place under Governments of both complexions has meant that the real figure is broadly similar. I see no point in returning to a lower figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find common ground with the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) on the future role of development corporations. The development corporations appear to be in the process of running down or declining. But I believe that they have demonstrated that they have a valuable role to play in future, and I should very much regret it if they were allowed to dwindle away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The partnerships established between
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
development corporations and local authorities in Preston, Chorley and Leyland have proved that those bodies can work in harmony on the problems of urban decay. Many small towns in Lancashire do not qualify for massive Government support through the inner cities programme. I am sure that they would greatly welcome development corporations taking an interest in and establishing a relationship with local authorities to meet their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there has been some mistrust in the past between development corporations and local authorities. Understandably, the local authorities do not want to see their powers diminished by the intervention of a development corporation. But it has been established that such a partnership can work and, indeed, is working in Central Lancashire. I should be unhappy if the knowhow and expertise acquired by the development corporations were not to be utilised to serve the community in future. There is a great area where that knowledge can usefully be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will comment on that matter and that there will be opportunities to pursue it on the Floor of the House, because I believe it to be of considerable importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.12 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friends the Members for Harlow (Mr. Newens) and Chorley (Mr. Rodgers) in supporting the order and in paying tribute to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the interest that he has shown in third generation new towns. I am sure that the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) will agree that the Minister has been diligent and helpful at all times in dealing with our difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northampton, South and I represent the partnership concept of the third generation new towns. The partnership concept has been an outstanding success. The formula that it provided of the closest possible cooperation between the city council—in the case of Peterborough—or county council and the new town development corporation has proved of great benefit to everybody. The Peterborough new town has already provided about 7,000 new dwellings through the development corporation and about 1,100 new dwellings on private land. In Peterborough, there has been no lack of will on the part of the development
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
corporation to encourage the inflow of firms to build private dwellings and to maintain the balance of which the hon. Member for Northampton, South spoke. I shall refer again to the question of balance and other issues raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Peterborough—probably in Northampton, too—we are now reaching the peak in our programme. Therefore, it is essential that the funds which are to be provided by this order should continue to be available so that the development corporation and the city can look with confidence to the completion of the new town. I welcome what the Minister said about the need for development corporations to press on with the objectives and targets of the programmes which have now been agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northampton, South was a little less than frank with the Committee. He spoke about broad strategic agreement between both sides on the new towns programme. I regret that the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) cannot be here today, because, to his credit, he has travelled round some of the new towns, including my own, and I know that he takes a slightly different view from that which has been expressed here today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hornsey has posed a real question mark over the future of both my new town and the new town represented by the hon. Member for Northampton, South. Against the background of the constant calls for massive cuts in public expenditure which have come from the Opposition during the past few years, I am anxious to get a commitment from the hon. Member for Northampton, South and his colleagues that they will not persist with something which could be damaging to the Peterborough new town and to the viability of its massive half-completed central area development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hornsey was quoted in the magazine "Planning" in November as saying that
	<br><q><p>"if the Tories decide more cuts in public expenditure are needed then towns like Northampton and Peterborough will be the first to go."</p></q>
Those words have caused great anxiety to the people of Peterborough. We are at the stage at which one more township is to be developed at Caistor. An important trunk road depends on that township. In my view, that road will not be constructed unless the township goes ahead. It is an important road development for the whole
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
area from Kings Lynn to the Midlands. I hope that we shall get more encouragement from the Opposition—if not today, in the near future—to the effect that they are reconsidering their view on the future of our two new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to what he called the lack of balance between private and public housing development. I dispute that the balance is in any way wrong either in Northampton or in Peterborough. Certainly, in both cities there is a great preponderance of privately-owned dwellings. Indeed, the development corporation is merely providing for human need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) said, we are providing for needs which the conurbation of London—all the London boroughs and the GLC—is not and will not be able to meet for many years to come. I pay tribute to Milton Keynes, Northampton and Peterborough. Their deliberate policy is to take a higher proportion of the people who are very low on the priorities in the city centre. They are the people who are most disadvantaged and have the greatest difficulty in getting employment—single-parent families and the elderly. Those third generation new towns are giving these people an opportunity to make a new start. I believe that over 200 families a month, of which almost half could be put in the categories I have mentioned, are moving to these new towns. There is no hope of those people finding the key to a better and more successful life in the inner city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a great tragedy if there were any slow-up in the progress of the third generation new towns, which are fulfilling a need which no other places in the country will fulfil. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will confirm that the Government intend to support the policy of these three new towns and to continue to allow them to meet this important need of the London conurbation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.19 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment on the constructive nature of this debate. I welcome the clear support that has been given by all who have spoken for the order that I have presented. I am grateful for the kind remarks that have been made about my stewardship of what I have always regarded as one of the most exciting and interesting responsibilities that I have ever had. In my view, things have gone well in most of the new towns,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
although some have faced special difficulties. It has been a great pleasure to see that progress and to be responsible to the House for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) asked me a number of specific questions, which I shall try to deal with to the best of my ability. The first was whether there was a case for the Government coming forward with requests for £250 million rather than £500 million. The answer is that it is for the Government to decide—perhaps for us all to decide— how often we believe it reasonable for a debate of this type to take place. The way in which things have run implies a debate of the sort that we are having now about once every other year. Primary legislation makes possible much wider debate on the Floor of the House. Therefore, I should have thought that this was satisfactory, together with the other opportunities which are available to the House, such as Question Time, Adjournment debates or other debates when new town matters are relevant to the subject under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the investment programme for new towns drops, so that the present size of tranche leads to a less frequent review, there might be a case for reducing the size of the tranche. However, I think that what concerns the hon. Gentleman is the frequency of debate rather than the size of tranche that we vote. No doubt we shall consider that matter when the time comes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether rollover was included in the £65 million. That figure includes both forward funding and rollover. Forward funding does not count as public expenditure. Rollover finance counts as public expenditure, but the new towns are controlled on capital expenditure net of receipts, subject to general overview of the rate and size of new town development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked for information about the estimates that we made for the housing programme for 1978 and future years. The figures are as follows: 1978, 10,300; 1979, 9,300; 1980, 8,000; 1981, 7,000; and 1982, 6,000. The hon. Gentleman will understand that the completion of the new towns' housing programme is bound to lead to a gradual drop in the overall housing programme of the new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised an issue that has been discussed in the House
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
and elsewhere many times—namely, the sale of new town houses. It might be relevant to refer the hon. Gentleman to answers that I gave in the House earlier this month. I was asked first about the proportion of owner-occupied and rented dwellings on land owned or provided by third generation new town development corporations. The figures for Northampton are: rented, 81 per cent.; owner-occupied, 19 per cent. The hon. Gentleman was right to draw attention to the wide disparity between owner-occupied and rented properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer that I gave on the proportion of rented and owner-occupied properties in the designated area of third generation new towns is intersting. In Northampton, the figures are: rented, 44 per cent.; owner-occupied, 56 per cent. A similiar contrast is obvious in many other third generation new towns. I do not believe that the position is quite so bad as it may have appeared to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a large stock of owner-occupied housing in Northampton. It is possible for people in rented accommodation who want to become owner-occupiers to buy houses in Northampton. I may be wrong. Perhaps there is pressure on owner-occupied housing in Northampton, but the figures do not demonstrate a shortage of opportunity for owner-occupation in that town, as the hon. Gentleman suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that in the early stages housing has to be rented. We know from a recent survey that in Northampton nearly 80 per cent, of the population want to own their own homes. We are already out of balance in our new town. There is also a tremendous shortage of property to buy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can go on with this argument. The hon. Gentleman said that 80 per cent, of the population want to own their own homes. Those who study the matter will see that, because of the level of income and funds available, it is impossible for many people to own their own homes, however much they may wish to do so. However, the Government have recently made practical contributions to enable people to do so. Serious trouble would be caused if we designed our housing policy on the basis that 80 per cent, of the population want to own their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) underlined the Government's policy on the issue. If there is a need for rented accommodation, it is not right for the Government to sell that accommodation. That has informed our policy since August 1976 when we said that the Department was willing to consider the resumption of sales, subject to the condition that there was an adequate supply of houses to rent. The Department added that the measure to be used would be the current waiting period applying to the main category of people housed by the corporation in question and applications would be considered where this period was less than three months. Corporations were asked to consult their local authorities before submitting applications to sell. That was the policy that we laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northampton, South suggested that the best moment to give people a right to buy their own houses was at the moment of transfer. I suspect that great difficulties would be caused during a major exercise of the transfer of housing to local authorities if, at the same time, it was also possible for people to purchase the freeholds of the houses in which they were living. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow would confirm that that would have created great difficulties in Harlow in what, in every other respect, was a highly successful exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it right for that decision to be made just before transfer—in effect, pre-judging any decision that a local authority may later wish to make about the housing stock in its area as a whole? It would be unwise of the Government, when considering housing investment programmes and the need to review the housing stock of a local authority area as a whole, to give individuals in the new towns the right to purchase their houses, thereby pre-judging any strategic decision that a district council may later wish to make about the balance between rented and owner-occupied housing in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We decided that it was not right to permit the Basildon development corporation to sell housing because it was strongly opposed by the district council in the area. I believe that decisions about the balance of housing stock in different parts of the country should be pronounced by local councils and that they should be consulted when decisions of that kind are being taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northampton,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
South expressed concern about the condition of transferred housing stock. Recently, there has been a great deal of publicity about the remedial work that local authorities claim is required to be done to the housing stock in some of the first generation new towns which were transferred to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the last few weeks, my Department has received a report from the Association of District Councils on the position in all 10 local authorities. However, the Association's report gives only brief details of the work which is claimed to be necessary and the estimates of the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transfer of the first generation new town housing was not, in the Government's view, on ungenerous terms. In many cases the outstanding loan debt payable by the authorities amounted to only £3,000 per dwelling or less. However, we shall have further discussions with the ADC about its report on the condition of the stock. Until these discussions have taken place, it is not possible to give any indication whether any additional financial assistance from the Government would be justified over and above the tapering grant for a five-year period, which has already been agreed under section 10 of the 1976 Act, which was designed to ease further the burden of transfer on the affected authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to say more on the subject of rollover—I dealt with the matter fully in my opening speech—except to underline three points. The first was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow. A considerable part of the stock of new town assets must be financed publicly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly—I underline this point because I do not think the hon. Member for Northhampton, South took it on board—if one sells off assets to pension funds or elsewhere, the new town development corporation is denied rent which enables it to pay off the interest charges that it has accumulated and therefore delays the time when it may be able to become financially in balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point that I urge the hon. Gentleman to bear in mind is the one I made on Third Reading of the Bill— namely, that one must be discerning about which stock is sold off and the terms on which it is sold off. In the case of first-generation new towns, where the stock is subject to leasehold arrangements and so on, it could be to the disadvantage of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
corporation—indeed, the public purse— if that stock were sold off before the lease was due. Those are the points which the hon. Gentleman and the Conservative Party need to bear carefully in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's support for the idea of new town development corporations in places such as Islington. I do not know whether that is Conservative Party policy or a suggestion that he threw out, but I am interested to hear that he is proposing these ideas. The Government have carefully considered them. My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Rodgers) pointed out the valuable and useful contribution which the new town development corporation in Central Lancashire has made in places such as Plungington and in his own constituency. That is also reflected in Northampton and Warrington in the very important contributions that development corporations have made in that sphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall want to watch how that development progresses and how successfully the partnership committees that we have set up proceed with their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital to remember the degree to which a whole range of public bodies in the inner city need to work together and cooperate to solve the problems in places such as Islington. Those bodies include the GLC the Inner London Education Authority, the borough councils, the police, the area health authority and others. The idea of the partnership committee is to get those bodies working together. I am sure that is better than attempting to set up a new town development corporation in a borough which is part of, and intimately inter-meshed with, the life of the whole inner city and GLC area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the interesting matter of the degree to which we could make our expertise—which I believe
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
to be unrivalled in new town development— available to foreign countries. New towns are involved to some degree by bringing their staff with specialised knowledge into direct touch with Governments interested in developing new towns in their countries. The financial arrangements will vary from case to case. The money provided in this order is not applicable to that particular operation. The way in which that is done varies. Sometimes it is a contract between a foreign Government and a development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt satisfactorily with the points raised by the hon. Member for Northampton, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Harlow, Chorley, and Peterborough (Mr. Ward). I agreed with what my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow said about the inevitable limit that must be placed on private investment in new towns. I am grateful, as I said earlier, for what my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley said about the work of the Central Lancashire development corporation. I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough said about the need to proceed with the job of developing the third generation new towns. The need is still there, and the job needs to go ahead.

I hope that the Committee will approve the order because of its vital importance in enabling the new town programme to go ahead in the way in which I think the whole Committee wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
