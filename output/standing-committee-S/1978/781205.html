	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Prosecution of Offences Regulations 1978 (S.I. No. 1375.)—[	<i>Mr. Alison.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say something about this matter. Some very harsh words have been said about these regulations and some very severe imputations have been made against the Government and even against the Opposition, although my hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison) tabled this prayer as soon as misgivings were expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the criticisms and fears behind the misgivings were unwarranted, to some extent, even obscure at least, for a while. However, there is one real point of substance. It was brought to our attention by the Nationwide Festival of Light, by Mr. Raymond Blackburn. The result is that an improvement will be made in these regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start by thanking the Festival of Light and Mr. Blackburn for bringing this matter to our attention, and the Government, particularly the Attorney-General, for his ready response to our representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall confine myself to one point on these regulations. When we followed up the representations that had been made, it became clear that what concerned a lot of people was that the regulations might result in more administrative work and more paper work in connection with the stamping-out of pornographic transactions. The Opposition felt that if that were the result of the regulations, it would be a wholly unintended result because we could not believe that anyone would wish to make it more difficult to proceed in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without waiting to see the regulations in detail, I telephoned the Attorney-General. He was good enough to see me immediately and to assure me that it was not the Government's intention to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
more administrative work, and, further, if the regulations were to bring about any such result, the Government would look at it again. He was also good enough to authorise me to discuss details direct with the Department of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following that, I discussed the details of the matter both with the National Festival of Light and Mr. Blackburn. I was told, as I previously believed to be the case, that far from wishing to make matters more difficult, both the Director and the Attorney-General wished to make it more simple and to bring proceedings in the metropolitan area into line with proceedings followed by chiefs of police outside the metropolitan area for a long time, and also to shorten the reporting process, with particular reference to obscene publications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then discussed the details with Mr. Johnston and Mr. Blackburn and it became apparent that what was giving them cause for concern was the provision in regulation 7. The provisions could call for quite a lot of paperwork. I altered my words there, from "do call" to "could call", because in some cases, even if the full force of regulation 7 operates, the amount of paperwork would be small. But it is clear that, if regulation 7 applied in its full force in some of the cases about which we are concerned, the result could be a lot of paperwork and other administrative work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As those gentlemen pointed out, regulation 7, as a matter of law, would apply to all the offences listed in paragraph 1 of regulation 6. It does not apply to all the offences which come within paragraph 2 of regulation 6. But the provisions of regulation 7 apply to all of those offences listed in paragraph 1 of regulation 6. Regulation 6(1)(	<i>g</i>) includes in that list:
	<br><blockquote><p>"offences involving obscene exhibitions or publications".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, as a matter of law, if these regulations came into force in this form it would be necessary for a chief of police to give the information called for under regulation 7 in respect of any offence coming within regulation 6(1) or any alleged offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I spoke to the Director of Public Prosecutions about this, he confirmed, of course, as the Attorney-General had said, that it was not the intention to apply regulation 7 in its full rigour to obscene publications. On the contrary, there were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
two specific steps already in hand which would lessen the amount of paperwork in this connection. Then a suggestion was put forward that if that be so there was no necessity to keep paragraph (1)(	<i>g</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into any more detail but it is always supposed that Government Departments—perhaps even Oppositions—move at snail pace. It ought to be known that within one hour of the suggestion that paragraph (1)(	<i>g</i>) might be left out of regulation 6 I received a phone call to say that it had gone right through to the Attorney-General. He accepted the proposition. It had never been in his mind to introduce more paperwork in connection with offences involving obscene exhibitions or publications. All that remained was to go into the mechanics of bringing about that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was only the middle of last week that all this happened. Since then, the Parliamentary Secretary has been good enough to tell me of the means proposed to implement this agreement, and I understand that the proposal is that amending regulations should be laid as soon as may be. I understand that the phrase "as soon as may be" in this instance, means in a matter of days. The effect will be to take out paragraph (1)(	<i>g</i>) of article 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my view that if that be done it meets fully and speedily the one point on which there was ground for misgivings. We welcome the speedy action by the Government. I hope that all will regard it as an illustration of how the layman, the Opposition and the Government can work together at speed and secure some useful purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.38 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment upon the remarks that have been made by the hon. and learned Gentleman. I refer first to regulation 6(1)(	<i>g</i>). I can understand why the Festival of Light and such organisations have made the representations they have, but, equally, I think that any practising lawyer knows that a great deal of public money has been expended in bringing to the court cases involving obscene exhibitions or publications and that the cases have been unsuccessful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the motivation for the inclusion of regulation 6(1)(	<i>g</i>) in these regulations simply because, if the matter in hand, in relation to the obscene publications or exhibitions, was referred to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
DPP, it would have enabled the DPP to pass on to the chief officer of police, or prosecuting authority, the experience which has been obtained centrally as to the possibility of success in prosecution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Clearly, in my search for brevity, I left out an important point. The proposed amendment does not mean to say that the Director's part in relation to these offences will be cut out altogether. It means that the full rigour of regulation 7 will not apply to prosecutions or to cases concerning obscene publications and exhibitions. The Director will be able to obtain the information he requires but prescribe a much simpler form of reporting under regulation 6(2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. and learned Gentleman for that further explanation. Perhaps it would have been wiser for me to wait until my hon. Friend gave his explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now have a further point concerning regulation 4. I believe that there is no more opaque relationship in Government than that between the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. I say that merely because I think that the vast majority of people consider that both offices are offices about which the public know very little, and it would appear, again under regulation 4—as set out, it is not altogether clear, but it appears to me from my reading of the regulation—that the relationship, even in those areas where the Attorney-General has the right to exercise his discretion—uninvited, I take it—that the DPP may offer his advice to the Attorney-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I think it appropriate that the DPP should be in a position to offer advice over a wide range of cases, the essence of my argument is that I believe that it is desirable—obviously, not in these regulations, because it is not appropriate—that at some stage we should seek to clarify the exact relationship between the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. That would be of advantage both to Members of Parliament and to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.42 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Department (Mr. Arthur Davidson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
his remarks. I shall deal briefly with the reasons for these regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure the Committee will know, these are the first regulations since 1946 to deal with the duties and obligations and the inter-relationship between the Director and other Departments. The regulations are somewhat overdue. They arise as a result of a working party which was set up. The working party reported to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and to my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General. The regulations were drawn up as a result of the recommendations of that working party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New regulations were needed because the present regulations are out of date, in two respects in particular. First, several types of case which should be referred to the Director are not sufficiently defined in the 1946 regulations. Secondly, in many cases, the wording of the regulations is in such wide terms that matters which need not concern the Director are sent to him. Those are matters which could properly be left to chief constables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the specific point raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman, to which my hon. Friend also referred. The existing practice of the Director of Public Prosecutions with regard to obscenity is that the feels that he should exercise control over this branch of the law—control in the sense that cases of obscenity are reported to him by various chief constables. That happens because it is felt—and I believe that the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree with this—that there should be some uniformity in prosecution policy and in what is a difficult, sensitive and delicate matter of law—a matter, not only of law, but one of public taste, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing practice is that chief constables send in reports about prima facie cases of obscenity, but they do not do so in the detail that is set out in regulation 7. They do not, for example, send the offending material itself. If they did so, the Director's office would be swamped with hundreds of thousands of copies of books with which that already overworked and understaffed office would be quite incapable of dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the existing practice could well be met by the inclusion of obscenity under regulation 6(2), which would in effect mean that a brief report would be sent to the Director. If, of course, the Director wants further details, or if there
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
is a matter which concerns a report, he can ask for those details from the chief constable. That is exactly what happens under existing practice. Therefore, when the hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out his misgivings, and other misgivings, about the inclusion of obscenity under regulation 6(1), it was readily agreed by my right hon. and learned Friend and by the Director that it could, without any diminution of the Director's interest in these matters, be included in regulation 6(2). I am happy to give the undertaking that an amending regulation will be introduced as soon as possible, to coincide, I hope, with the commencement of the regulation now before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester, West (Mr. Watkinson) on the relationship between the Director and the Attorney-General, which I appreciate is a mystery to many people, the Prosecution of Offences Act 1879 refers to that relationship. Section 2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Director of Public Prosecutions, under the superintendence of the Attorney General, to institute, undertake, or carry on such criminal proceedings …"</p></blockquote>
That is why that relationship is not referred to in the regulation. It is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a whole variety of matters of sensitivity and public interest the Attorney-General would consult the Director, and the Director would consult the Attorney-General. Clearly, the advice given by the Director to the Attorney-General is of great importance. Having worked in the office of the Attorney-General, perhaps I may pay tribute to the Director for the advice that he gives. I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the Director and his staff. They work under great difficulties. Inevitably, by the very nature of the prosecutions they undertake they cannot please everybody. They are bound to be the subject of criticism which, for a non-political body, is difficult to undergo time after time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations come into operation on 1st January 1979. The amending regulations can, perhaps, be laid before then, but they will have to lie for 40 days. However, I give the undertaking on behalf of the Director that in the meantime the Director's office will operate as if the regulations had been amended. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. and learned Gentleman and any others who have similar misgivings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.50 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already paid a tribute to the Director's office, but in any case I should like to echo what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the undertaking, I quite understand the position with regard to time. We are quite happy with this undertaking that, even though the amending order cannot come into force until after the date when this one comes into force, the matter will be treated as though the amending order was in force. I am happy with that, on the clear understanding, of course, that the whole purpose of this is that the shortest possible form of reporting would, in fact, be the practice from now on. With those observations, Mr. Doig, I am happy to say that we are content with the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to echo the various tributes and compliments paid to the different actors in this drama, if I may put it in that way, Mr. Doig, from the Director at the top through, naturally, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Department—that distinguished Minister whose presence and advice we all value on these occasions—to the Festival of Light and others outside who have
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
taken an interest in these matters. We are much obliged to the hon. Gentleman for being constructive and helpful in his response to this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a technical point, Mr. Doig, I wonder whether you would guide me as to what I should now do, my prayer having been more than requited. How do I, as it were, withdrawn it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just checked on the regulations and apparently the hon. Member cannot withdraw it in this Committee. I will now put the Question, if that is all he wants to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case there is nothing more to be said here, Mr. Doig, except for the thanks that I have already expressed, not only to the members of the Committee but also to yourself for presiding with wisdom over our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
