	<p>10.32 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I were to say that I understand that the Committee is agreeable that these three instruments shall be considered together. If that is so, we can have general debate on them, at the end of which perhaps the honourable Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker) will propose formally the remaining two motions, and I shall put the necessary Questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.33 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lynda Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Family Income Supplements (General) Amendment Regulations 1979 (S.I. No. 160).</p></blockquote>
I wish to confirm to both Government spokesmen that in no way do the Opposition wish to oppose these three instruments. But I believe that in each case there are matters which deserve parliamentary discussion, and a debate such as this, though taken in Committee upstairs, can indeed help by publicising once more what is going on. More publicity is always welcome for the detailed arguments that are put forward on these subjects. We can also clarify any outstanding questions which have arisen in the time between the instrument being laid, and our discussions today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I make no bones about starting with the family income supplements regulations, SI No. 160. Both sides of this House have often said how necessary it is that we should, when circumstances allow, reduce the number of hours needed for entitlement to family income supplement from 30 to 24. The reason will be clear to the Committee. It is the urgent need to ensure that we do
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
not disentitle lone parents, in particular, from being with their children at the end of school hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us will have noticed in our own localities the grave problems that occur with children who are left unattended after scsool. I have always felt that, for families who were pressed for both money and time, a reduction in the hours of work for entitlement to FIS could not come too soon. It is, therefore, an unreserved welcome that I give to these regulations, for the sake of the children who ought to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I make a plea to employers of those persons who are severely pressed with problems of children coming home to empty homes to consider earlier finishing hours, and to make the 24 hours' entitlement the most convenient that can be arranged, both for the firm and for the employee. In that way, the children will receive the care after school hours that clearly—from the reports we have received from social workers—they greatly need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one is asking for employers to cut their own throats. But, a number of companies have introduced flexi-time, and some have started by introducing flexitime for their single-parent families and for those with children at home. That is a welcome move, which we shall do well to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a number of points to make and a number of questions to ask the Minister. I gather that these regulations will bring about 10,000 more families into entitlement to family income supplement at an increased annual cost of about £1.5 million. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us what proportion of the new 10,000 so entitled he estimates will be single-parent families, and what proportion, therefore, will be two-parent families but still entitled to family income supplement. At present, about 43 per cent, of those entitled to FIS are single-parent families. I estimate that, by reducing the hours, we may bring in a greater proportion of the single-parent families which today miss out. I should like confirmation of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Secondly I have noticed, in going back over some of the figures of family income supplement beneficiaries, that there has been a considerable fluctuation over the years, according to when pay settlements were made or were not made. The figure varied from 65,000 in 1971–72 to as many as 95,000 in 1973–74, and then it went down again in 1975–76 to about 59,000 after some fairly dramatic wage settlements in 1974–75.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the last few months, we have seen a number of wage settlements that were higher than expected. I am not sure, therefore, whether the Department has yet been able to do some crystal ball gazing about the number of persons that it expects, with the new regulations in force, to claim FIS in the coming two financial years. Some revision may take place of the cost of FIS in 1979–80, on the basis of the settlements already made. If the Minister has any information on that score, we shall be glad to hear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worry that comes every time we increase the number of people who qualify for this means-tested benefit, which we always believe has been a transitional benefit—probably the longest transitional benefit that we have ever had—is that we find that, of those entitled to FIS, many are still paying a large proportion back in tax to the Exchequer. Because we are now to deal with borderline cases—those who v/ork 24 hours in the week—I wonder how many more people, according to the Department's current estimates, will be brought into the dangerous situation of the poverty trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an article in 	<i>New Society</i> last November, Christopher Pond referred to those who are able to benefit from family income supplement if they earn less than £44.50 a week. He went on to say that they would have to pay tax on anything they earnt in excess of £33.37 a week. The situation is getting worse. I hope that the Minister has made strong representations to the Chancellor of the Exchequer about what he may do next week to ensure that those who gain family income supplement when their earnings are low are not penalised through out-of-phase changes of taxation with the increases in FIS. The two Departments must work together,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
otherwise those families will be in a constant state of uncertainty until they are lifted out of entitlement to FIS by earning higher wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to bring to the Minister's notice a problem that has arisen over entitlement and will no doubt arise over the reduction of hours. Where a family has, over a period, been refused FIS there has been a tendency for people to depress their earnings by refusing to work overtime for the statutory entitlement period in order to qualify. Once they are in the qualifying bracket—where their earnings are not then reviewed for another 52 weeks—they go back to working overtime, thereby receiving their FIS erroneously. It is a difficult situation. In cases where, after continual refusal of entitlement, the benefit is then granted, has the Department considered having a further check to ensure that no manipulation of the system has occurred? We know that the problem stems from low wages, but it is unfair on those who play the entitlement game by the book and who do not deliberately reduce their overtime earnings to qualify. I have had an increasing post-bag on the matter and it is one that the Department must look at. I wish to put three questions to the Minister. On 26 July last, we had a discussion on the Family Income Supplements (Computation) Regulations. At that time, we were not so worried about any substantial change of circumstances during the 52 weeks. However, the comments we made then about dealing with women heads of household have not been fully answered during the intervening period. I should like to ask the Minister again whether the Department has considered giving entitlement to FIS to women heads of household where they are the earners, or whether the matter has been put in the waiting tray to be considered with the rest of the recommendations for social assistance at the review of the SBC. I shall assume that the Government are of the same opinion if there is nothing to announce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem arising from that debate on 26 July is that of second families and whether the Inland Revenue will allow maintenance paid by a husband,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
who has remarried, to his first wife to be set against his gross taxable earnings. The matter has been discussed before. There are second families now who are in considerable financial difficulty because of the settlement made where the divorced wife does not work because she receives more by continuing to depend on maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second wife is often forced out to work because of the level of maintenance being paid to the first wife. Whereas the first wife has an entitlement to family income supplement, owing to the inability of the Inland Revenue to allow maintenance to be set against gross taxable earnings of the partners in the second marriage, they are not entitled to family income supplement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise the problem again because we did not satisfactorily conclude the matter last July. The pressure for Parliament to resolve this matter—there is no party dispute here—is on the increase through the emergence and very strong campaigning of the Campaign for Justice in Divorce. That organisation is now dealing with a number of problems of severe financial difficulty in second marriages, which affects the FIS position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have dealt with the questions which arise in conjunction with the reduction from 30 to 24 hours ill the entitlement for family income supplement. We greatly welcome the fact that this has been made possible, although it would be wrong if I did not say that a bit of suspicion about the timing of this measure is felt by some of my colleagues, even if (hose are not my own feelings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now ask a few questions on Statutory Instruments Nos. 171 and 172, so that we may put the record straight?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The heading of order No. 171, the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 (Commencement No. 13) Order 1979, may mislead us. We may not understand that we are dealing with the phasing-in of men reaching the age of 60 to claim for mobility allowance. There has been some misunderstanding outside the House about whether it affects claims that are made after 7 March, or claims submitted before 7 March 1979. As I read it, it means that thai is the date on which those reaching
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the age of 60 between 7 June 1978 and 21 December 1979 will become so entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH AND SOCIAL SECURITY (Mr. Alfred Morris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The date of 7 March is that from which claims are acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the very point that we needed to clarify, because there have been some misleading press notices. Some said that they ought to have had their claims in by that date, and that was my query.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other criticisms that have been made of the order fall because the Minister has said that that is the date from which men becoming 60 between 7 June 1978 and 21 December 1979 may now claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is any restriction on the time by which those people should claim or any further restriction that affects order No. 171, I shall be grateful if the Minister would mention it when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be of help if I recall the words that I used. In making the announcement, I said that I was pleased to announce that men and women born on or after 7 June 1918 would be invited to claim mobility allowance from 7 March 1979. They will start to receive payment of the allowance from 6 June.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalkcr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for clarifying that. He has also made the other point that often arises outside this House, namely that "men" should also read "women". I do not think there will come a day when we use the word "persons" in our legislation, but some ladies were concerned at one stage. However, I managed quickly to set many minds at rest on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to Statutory Instrument No. 172, which deals with a problem that regularly confronts many Members of Parliament in their correspondence. That is the need for a clearer definition of the words "virtual inability to walk". In reading the regulations, I feel that every attempt has been made by the Department to clarify in the schedule those circumstances in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
which, for the purposes of section 37A of the Social Security Act 1975, a person is virtually unable to walk through physical disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should pay tribute to the energetic efforts of my right honourable Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker) in the case of a child suffering from Down's Syndrome, which brought to light the great difficulty faced by families with primarily mentally handicapped children, but with associated physical disability. They did not come under the original definition of "virtually unable to walk" included in the entitlement for the mobility allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other cases, and I am sure that when the Minister replies, he will refer to them. They are mainly those with chest and heart diseases. A number of problems arise from the definition of "virtually unable to walk". I see from paragraph 3 (1) (	<i>b</i>) that we now define "virtually unable to walk" as
	<br><blockquote><p>"ability to walk out of doors being so limited as regards the distance over which or the speed at which or the length of time for which or the manner in which"</p></blockquote>
the person
	<br><blockquote><p>"can make progress on foot without severe discomfort".</p></blockquote>
That wording is better than previous wording. But the problem area is that of men and women suffering from diseases such as angina and various chest diseases who have good days and bad days. They claim in correspondence that they had a very good day when they went to the Ministry doctor, but that most of the time they are suffering and having bad days. I see that the honourable Member for Eccles (Mr. Carter-Jones) agrees. I suspect that he has as many letters on this matter as I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One solution, which has often been put to Members of Parliament, is that reports from the general practitioner should be considered in addition to the report of the Ministry doctor. We know that they are taken into account, but I believe that in trying hard to clarify the intention of the awarding of mobility allowance in some cases, other groups of people will
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
feel that their claims are not sufficiently thoroughly investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I shall be grateful if the Minister can turn his mind also to the problems of people who have diseases which inevitably make it difficult for them to walk, but who have periods of remission and often have been disentitled— they believe unfairly—during a period of remission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister tell us how much weight and what consideration is given by the Ministry doctors to both the reports of consultants and of local GPs who watch some of the potential claimants over a much longer period of time than it is possible for a Ministry doctor to do? I realise that there is a problem, because the local GP may be much more sympathetic to the awarding of a mobility allowance than a Ministry doctor. He knows the person, and sees the person frequently. But I feel that we should consider the matter in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one further question to ask the Minister. Some honourable Members are very concerned, particularly in the light of the Government's promised removal of vehicle excise duty from all car drivers, about the value of the mobility allowance. If VED is removed from all drivers, the gain of £50 a year that was won for the disabled driver in the Finance Bill Committee will be lost. We have taken frequent opportunities to ask the Minister whether he has yet managed to conclude an agreement with the Treasury about the increase that will be made if there is to be a phasing out of vehicle excise duty for all drivers, because an adjustment will be necessary for the disabled driver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering these regulations, therefore, which extend the mobility allowance to those who have so far not been entitled to it, perhaps the Minister will also say what his intention is about the value of the mobility allowance for the coming year. It will be as well to have that out in the open here and now, in view of what may or may not happen later today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for taking some time, but it is important that we have firmly on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
record the answers to some of the questions that I have asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Eric Deakins)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond to the comments of the honourable Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker) on the FIS regulations, S.I. No. 160?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the regulations, as the honourable Lady pointed out, is simply to reduce from 30 to 24 the number of hours that lone parents have to work in order to be eligible for FIS. That was a recommendation of the Finer Committee. It has been strongly championed by the National Council for One-Parent Families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been committed to the change for some time. As the honourable Lady recognised, it was announced some months ago. However, our pledge has always been that it could be introduced only when resources permitted. The importance that we attach to the change—which will cost, as the honourable Lady said, about £1.5 million—is shown by the fact that we have given it priority at a time when, as I need hardly remind the Committee, opportunities for additional public expenditure are few and far between.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the honourable Lady pointed out, we estimate that the reduction in hours will bring up to another 10,000 lone parents into FIS. The estimate cannot be too precise, because it is based on a small sample of working lone parents in the family expenditure survey. The figures on which we are working in the FES are for 1976. It takes months, if not years, for all the figures to be statistically analysed. I hope that, later this year, we shall have the 1977 figures, and we can then perhaps update the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of 10,000 does not, however, take into account lone parents who may reduce their working hours to take advantage of the new rule. Unfortunately, it is impossible to say how many lone parents may do that. There are so many factors to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not think that the effect of the regulations in the current year will be to vary the load very greatly. Most of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
beneficiaries are already on the benefit, which is awarded for 12 months. We have no estimates yet of the load for 1979–80, because that will depend largely on the 1979 uprating. That will be the big factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning the manipulation—I think that that is the kindest word that one can use—of FIS, whereby for the five weeks, or, if one is on a monthly basis, the two months before one gets on to FIS, one has to produce one's income slips and so on and may try to reduce one's income, we have no evidence that deliberate depressions of earnings are a major problem. There is inevitable difficulty with a 52-week award, but we still feel that it ought to remain a 52-week award because of the poverty trap effect, to which I shall turn in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not keep any record of people whose claims are turned down. We do not think it would be worth starting to do so, because we are trying to keep the administration of the scheme as simple as possible. I am told—I find this surprising— that our administration costs are only 4p per £1 of benefit paid, which is very low indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the honourable Lady's plea that we should not underestimate the importance of FIS for lone parents in low-paid jobs. One-parent families account for nearly half the families on FIS. Our present estimate is about 40,000 out of 90,000. The scheme favours one-parent families in two important respects. First, the child benefit increase—the lone parent's premium—is completely ignored when entitlement is assessed. Secondly, and even more significant, a lone parent on FIS gets exactly the same amount of benefit as a couple with the same income and number of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average FIS payment is about £5 a week. Clearly, beneficiaries on very low incomes can obtain considerably more than that. For example, a lone parent with three children and a gross income of £29 a week—not a very high wage—will get £12.50 FIS, to which is added £12 child benefit and the £2 child benefit premium. That is a tax-free total of £26.50 a week on top of earnings, as well as a possible entitlement to housing benefits
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
and automatic entitlement to other benefits, such as free school meals and free National Health Service dental treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That reduction in the hours of work rule will be a major concession, and a recognition of the special problem facing working lone parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lewis Carter-Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not my honourable Friend making out a good case for a national minimum wage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Deakins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that I may well be. Indeed, if I may say so without trespassing on the province of another Department, I have always favoured a minimum wage. But I shall merely point out to those who favour a minimum wage that that is a form of incomes policy, and there are some parties that are both against an incomes policy and also in favour of a minimum wage. However, that is an internal matter that we have to sort out in our own movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter-Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my honourable Friend report what has been said in the Committee this morning to honourable Friends who may have some influence in this matter, to see whether the issue can be taken up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Deakins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Sir Thomas. I respect your point. My honourable Friend has been very good, but I shall not follow him any further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the problem of working lone-parent families, we are conscious of the fact that lone parents may have to curtail their working hours to make satisfactory arrangements for the care of their children—a matter that the honourable
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Lady emphasised. The problem often arises during after-school hours. That is important. In the uprating debate, to which I have already referred, the honourable Member for Wallasey told us about the growing problems in our cities, towns and rural areas of children not receiving all the parental attention they desperately needed because their parents were forced by the system to be at work for longer hours than were beneficial to them. It is because we share her concern that we want to improve the position for a particularly vulnerable group—the low-income one-parent families on FIS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the honourable Lady's plea to employers to take account of the fact that some of their workers could now be eligible for FIS, particularly lone parents, and to see what they can do to adjust hours of work to suit the convenience of working lone parents—mothers or fathers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal to reduce the hours of work rule has been favourably commented upon, as one would expect, by those concerned with lone parents. My officials have invited the major interest groups and advisory bodies, such as the National Council for One-Parent Families, Gingerbread, the CPAG, and the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux, to help us publicise the change. Not surprisingly, they have responded helpfully and with enthusiasm. I am sure that that will be valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two of the bodies have expressed interest in the advice to be given to lone parents who appear to be entitled to both FIS and supplementary benefit. This is a somewhat complicated issue but, briefly, the possible overlap occurs because the Supplementary Benefits Commission may well regard work of between 24 and 30 hours as part-time work. Which benefit will be more appropriate for a particular lone parent would obviously depend on his or her individual circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to give general advice, but lone parents who want individual advice will be able to get it from their local social security offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important point which I must stress is that an award of FIS will not rule out a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
subsequent award of supplementary benefit or vice versa. We shall take steps to ensure that lone parents concerned know of their possible entitlement to both benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the question raised by the honourable Lady about the poverty trap. She will recognise that this stems not so much from poverty but from the means used to relieve poverty, that is, the means-tested benefits available to poor working families. We made it clear that if we could, we would do away with these benefits overnight. They are complex, costly to administer and, because they are not taken up in full, not completely effective. Therefore, as a means of increasing the incomes of low-income families, they are very much a second choice. But clearly we must live with means-tested benefits for some time to come. The resources needed to replace them by universal benefits, as we are doing with child benefit, are simply not available. In the long term, our aim is to reduce dependence on means-tested benefits. Meanwhile, they are giving essential protection to poorer families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a preoccupation with the poverty trap and its theoretical effects. I stress the word "theoretical". In practice, the more serious effects of the trap are seldom felt because of the time lag between the receipt of a pay increase and the review of the benefit award, and because benefits are uprated regularly. With FIS, for example, an award continues for 52 weeks, regardless of any subsequent change in income—usually a rise—after the date of the claim and, since FIS is uprated every 12 months, at some time during the currency of an award of FIS the prescribed amounts will have been uprated: thus higher earnings are set against higher prescribed amounts when the claim is renewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the emphasis placed in some quarters on the possibility that families might be worse off as a result of a pay rise, the estimates show that a comparatively small number—considerably fewer than 5,000—are theoretically in this position. Impeccable though the theory may be, the reality is that the Department has never yet seen an authenticated case where
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
a pay rise has led to a net loss of income. We are, of course, talking about 100 per cent, marginal rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of what the Minister is saying to the Committee. But the point still appears to me, and to many others both inside and outside the House, that it would be far better, in the interests of these families who have an entitlement to FIS, if his right honourable and honourable Friends in the Treasury were to raise the levels of the tax threshold so that we did not have the invidious position where an FIS recipient was also a taxpayer. It is far better that benefit is given directly. My question was whether the Minister had had recent discussions— we keep raising this issue—with his Treasury colleagues about the imbalances that occur and the payments that have to be made in tax by FIS recipients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Deakins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my colleagues in the Treasury are well aware of our concern on this matter. It does not, of course, affect only FIS families. It also affects the whole of the working poor. Much will depend on the result of tonight's vote and what sort of Budget we have next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a Green Paper on the taxation of the family later this year—I believe some time in the summer—published by the Treasury for public discussion. I hope that, as a result, more public attention will be given to the problem and that the next Government, of whichever colour, will take this problem on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady asked about maintenance payments. I wrote to her in August of last year. In essence, our view is that an FIS father with the difficulty, mentioned by the honourable Lady, of having an ex-wife and a current wife should apply to the court to suspend or reduce the maintenance that he has to pay. That appears to be the straightforward way of proceeding. I do not think that my Department can take that much further, if there is to be further progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take note of the honourable Lady's reference to an organisation called Campaign for Justice in Divorce which, I confess, I had not heard of, and which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
may well be approaching us. Perhaps the Lord Chancellor and even the Home Office will do so on this issue. I am not aware that this is an issue on which there is currently a great deal of public concern, but I am open to be convinced when representations are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady also asked about heads of household entitlement and whether this is the breadwinner concept, and so on. This is, of course, part of the supplementary benefit review. Ministers are sympathetic towards this aspect, although it clearly depends on resources and the outcome of the consultations on the review. One matter is clear. We shall not do anything on FIS without doing it on supplementary benefit. We cannot have the FIS tail wagging the supplementary benefit dog—if that is the right metaphor to use, and probably it is in relation to the number of people on FIS and the vast number on supplementary benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady also asked whether we could make a further check on income during the year. I think that would be inappropriate. This is a very simply administered benefit and, if we started making subsequent checks, it would upset all the arrangements that we have made. We would need a large number of additional civil servants. I do not believe that would be justified. The whole virtue, as I am sure the honourable Lady will recognise, is that it is a simply administered benefit. Of course, it has some rough edges. Nevertheless, I believe that, by and large, its present form should not be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the National Council for One-Parent Families would like to see a further reduction in the hours of work from 24 hours to 20 hours. I understand its enthusiasm. We shall bear its view in mind as we monitor the effects of this reduction to 24 hours. The cost of a further reduction to 20 hours would be about £3 million a year. I need hardly remind the Committee that we have many other demands for expenditure of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that any extension of a means tested benefit may appear to be at odds with our policy of reducing dependence
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
upon such benefits. We have never liked FIS, but we have to be realistic. It is a valuable supplement for people on low incomes and it is important as an incentive to families depending on supplementary benefit to return to work. We must bear that factor in mind. Therefore, while it has a part to play, we are determined to maintain its value and to modify it in ways which will help existing and potential beneficiaries. Obviously, we are wholeheartedly committed to the concept of universal benefits. I believe that the one-parent child benefit premium is a major advance, particularly for working families on low incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I am sure that the many devoted interest groups which serve lone parents will examine our comments today with great care. I believe that from both sides they will observe not only sympathy and concern for the problems of one of the least privileged groups in the working population, but a will to take positive, realistic steps to help this group wherever possible. That is what the order does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.12 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to make only a few remarks. Obviously, I do not object to the order. It is designed to help people living in dire poverty, and we should snatch at any opportunity to improve their lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, I believe that it should be made clear that many of us consider the FIS formula to be a wretched business and that we are committed to abolishing it entirely. Basically, its exact purpose is that the community should provide a subsidy to the mean employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker) expressed some concern for the employer, admittedly while seeking a formula to enable the employer to adjust hours to accommodate a lady with family commitments and in receipt of FIS. There is no danger of that employer cutting his throat. The employer whose employees qualify for FIS is not the type to put himself at risk in any circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that it was trivial to suggest that some people in receipt of FIS are able, with Machiavellian cunning, to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
manoeuvre their incomes so that they work excessive overtime—apparently in spasms—and qualify for FIS for a further period. Such cases must be unique. We should not bother with such trivia, especially against a background of tax evasion on a massive scale throughout the country. It is estimated that £1,000 million a year is lost through evasion of taxation. In fact, whole industries have been set up to encourage and enable people to evade the payment of taxes. The idea of anyone working in a low-paid industry in order to qualify for FIS strikes me as being completely absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I agree with the honourable Lady about women heads of households who do not qualify for FIS. I cannot think why such people were not included when the scheme was originally introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the way to remedy the tax problem is to raise the tax threshold. I should prefer the tax threshold to be adjusted than that the Chancellor should adjust the rates of taxation. Many people at the bottom end of the income scale find themselves paying income tax which I believe they should not have to pay. I refer to pensioners in receipt of modest private pensions, people on FIS and a whole range of other people at the bottom end of the scale. The way to deal with that problem is to raise the threshold, not to alter the different points of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main purpose in speaking today is to put on record that many of us believe that this wretched FIS should be outlawed as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker) reminded us that often when people say "men" they also mean "women". Were I to use the word "yeoman" today, I should certainly want to include the honourable Lady. The way in which she discharged the onerous task of facing us single-handed this morning was very much a yeoman or "yeowoman" performance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Yeoperson".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
sible word for us to use as a compliment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was almost left with the impression that there had been some overmanning on the Opposition side. If the honourable Lady can do the job of the Opposition as well as she did this morning, why does she need any assistance from those who have detained us on other such occasions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer first to the Mobility Allowance Amendment Regulations 1979. These regulations make a modest but significant improvement to the mobility allowance scheme. First, they clarify the phrase "virtually unable to walk" by giving some statutory guidance on the factors to be taken into account. Secondly, when read in conjunction with the National Insurance Commissioner's decision —now reported as Decision No. R(M)2 of 78—they should enable a number of people who have had some problems in establishing entitlement in the past to qualify for the allowance in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter-Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am at a loss to understand why my honourable Friend keeps saying that it is a modest proposal. I read the schedule to these regulations which makes it clear that it is wide open. Normally I attack those who draft regulations, but this time I must congratulate them. I warn my honourable Friend that we can drive a horse and cart through this little lot. It is exactly what we wanted. I do not know how he will get the funds to do it, but I made a note to ask him a direct question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From time to time we have said to those v/ho have walked to our surgeries, "Sorry, mate. The fact that you have walked here means that you cannot get it". What do we do about all those people who come into our surgeries breathless, possibly suffering from emphysema, bronchitis, angina, asthma, arthritis, multiple scelerosis or pneumoconiosis? In the past we have said "No" to them. How do we bring this schedule to their notice? I believe that this is dynamite. I am delighted and thrilled with it. I accept it. My honourable Friend has won a victory. He must not call it modest. It is a great gain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all use words in different ways. My honourable Friend said that he could drive a horse and cart through these regulations. There will be those who wish him "Happy driving". I used the word "modest" to describe these regulations today because they are of limited effect compared with the order about which I shall seek to speak later. Many thousands of people benefit from the order. A lesser number will benefit from these regulations. My honourable Friend has a distinguished reputation in this sphere. If he can help more disabled people through his work in the Committee and in the House, I know that he will be delighted to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In speaking of the regulations, I have referred to people who, although apparently physically able to walk, cannot or do not walk to any significant extent because of a mental condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honourable Members may like also to be aware that the new statutory guidance on the phrase "virtually unable to walk" is provided at the request of the National Insurance Advisory Committee. It extends the "unable to walk" rule with its meaning of a total inability to walk. The intention is to include in the mobility allowance scheme people who can walk to some degree, but whose scope and quality of walking is so poor that it virtually amounts to an inability to walk. In other words, they are people who cannot walk to any appreciable extent. In assessing the ability to walk no single factor, such as distance, is decisive. The time taken to achieve distance, and the quality of the walking, must also be taken into account. Again, any walking which can be achieved only with severe pain or discomfort should be ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the new regulations, my Department is revising its two major leaflets on the mobility allowance. The first gives general guidance to claimants, and the other advises medical practitioners on the criteria for the allowance. We believe that, under our present powers, we have now gone as far as we are able to do, in clarifying the intentions of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my honourable Friend the Member for Eccles will be pleased to learn that we are revising the major
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
leaflets. He asked me how people attending his surgery in Eccles could be informed of the changes that were to be made. The revising of the leaflets should be most helpful in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to people with mental handicap difficulties, these new regulations, when read in conjunction with the Commissioner's decision, will enable the medical authorities to take into account a mental condition where they consider it relevant. They will then be able to decide whether the individual is virtually unable to walk in the light of his condition as a whole. In considering the second question, they will be required to consider only the extent of his or her walking capacity without severe discomfort. They will thus be able to include the person who only walks a short distance before being unable to move further where this is not of his or her own volition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Department has examined some 22,400 disallowed cases individually, and has identified about 50 where a claim might be allowed by the independent adjudicating authorities as the result of the new regulations. The people involved will be contacted individually and invited to submit new claims. For the future, we will continue, as we have done in the past, to advise everybody whatever their condition, if they consider themselves to be unable or almost unable to walk, to make a claim for the allowance. This applies equally, of course, to people who have in their care a child or someone who is unable to manage his or her own affairs. I must emphasise here that there is no disadvantage whatever in making a claim. If the claim is disallowed by the independent statutory authorities, there is an appeals procedure which can be followed. The Department is doing everything it can to publicise the rights of disabled people in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As honourable Members are aware, questions of entitlement to mobility allowance are not decided by Ministers or civil servants. They are decided by independent statutory authorities, and this cannot be repeated often enough. I am sure most people consider this to be the right way to do things and, in an imperfect world, it is perhaps the nearest we can get to achieving equity between
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
claimants and consistency in decisions. If one has an independent system, it must be allowed to run its course and, with such a system, new benefits inevitably bring new problems. With any new benefit—and I am glad to have been involved in the introduction of many new benefits for disabled people—there are always difficulties at the margin of entitlement. It is essential, therefore, that the system is used fully to seek a clarification of the law when that is thought desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case which gave rise to the regulations is a good illustration of what I mean. The honourable Lady referred to the case this morning. It was a case that concerned, as honourable Members may be aware, a boy suffering from Down's syndrome who was hyperactive and speechless. The med'cal practitioner who first examined the boy reported that, although not physically disabled, his mental handicap rendered unaided walking impossible in his case. He also found that mongolism was the main condition giving rise to his lack of walking ability. The medical practitioner's final assessment was that the boy was unable or virtually unable to walk because of physical disablement. The insurance officer, acting within his statutory authority as the first of the independent adjudicators, referred the claim to a medical board. Following its own examination, the board concluded that the boy was not unable or virtually unable to walk because of physical disablement. Finally, the medical questions came before a medical appeal tribunal, on an appeal by the boy's mother. For its part, the tribunal took the view that mongolism was a condition due to faulty genetic inheritance which could be classified as a physical disorder. It accepted that the boy could walk for some yards. Nevertheless it concluded that his erratic behaviour seriously impaired his mobility, that it was directly due to mongolism and that it was, therefore, physical as to its cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why were matters not left there? It was never my intention to exclude from the scheme people who suffer from Down's syndrome. Indeed it is a fundamental principle of the mobility allowance scheme that it is not tied to any diagnostic group or condition. It is there for people who
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
lack walking ability, and many sufferers from Down's syndrome were in fact already benefiting from the allowance. Many others had not, however, been successful, and we had clear evidence of inconsistent decisions in cases of this kind. We could not dictate to the independent adjudicating authorities what view they should take. Their freedom of decision is clear and unfettered. Yet we had to have a clear understanding of what the law meant in such circumstances. That was why the matter was referred to the National Insurance Commissioner for a definitive ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one and only purpose in making the reference was to achieve equity and consistency throughout the country. I made my own position very clear in the Adjournment debate in the House on 7 December 1977 by making it plain that I would be delighted if the Commissioner found in the boy's favour. With my right honourable Friend, I am very glad that he did so in the event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made the regulations which are now before the Committee both to clarify the position for the future and as a direct result of what has gone before. Our action enabled the National Insurance Advisory Committee and, through it, many other people to give a thorough airing to the possibilities for change in the mobility allowance scheme. I am very grateful to all who made their views known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have thus been able to safeguard the interests of a small but very needful and deserving group of disabled people. I conclude what I have to say about the regulations by reminding honourable Members of the steady progress we have achieved in this important area over the years. Spending by the Department on mobility for the disabled stood at £13 million in the financial year 1974–75. We have pushed that up to around £67 million in the financial year 1978–79. Planned expenditure, including the improvements we are now making to the upper age-limit for entitlement, will rise —at 1978 prices, and without adjustment for upratings or other variations— to £90 million in 1979–80 and to £96 million
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
in 1980–81. This achievement has to be considered against a background of financial constraints and, indeed, actual economies by other Departments. There are many pressures for further extensions to the scheme on behalf of the blind, the mentally ill and mentally handicapped generally, people who suffer from agoraphobia and epilepsy among others. There is a strong feeling also that the upper age limit for the allowance should be dispensed with entirely. There is pressure, too, for children below the age of live to be brought into the scheme. We still have a long way to go in this complex subject of mobility of the disabled before we achieve all that we would like to see. Let us not, however, forget the distance we have already travelled. Already, we have some 112,000 people receiving the allowance, more than 80 per cent, of whom are receiving mobility help for the very first time: This figure includes 15,000 children aged five to fifteen for whom previously there was no mobility help at all. These figures, and the fact that the mobility allowance scheme aims Ultimately to benefit 145,000 people, put the Government's efforts in sharp perspective. I commend the regulations to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the order. I very much welcome this opportunity to explain in detail the effects of this order. First, I must explain that with its companion orders for women, it is the first stage in providing equal treatment for men and women so that both can establish entitlement to the mobility allowance up to the age of 65. This means that for women, the upper age limit for entry is accordingly raised from 60 to 65. I am sure that this change in particular will be warmly welcomed by the estimated 20,000 women between the ages of 60 and 65 who will now be able to claim the mobility allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must also explain that although the order applies to men, we have been accepting claims from both men and women in the new age group from 7 March. The Social Security Bill has received the Royal Assent since the commencement order was laid. We were subsequently advised that two commence-
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
ment orders would be necessary for women, one under the old powers for those aged 59 and one under the new powers for those aged 60. Both those orders were made yesterday and are being laid before the House today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People born on or after 7 June 1918 can now claim the mobility allowance and they will start to receive payment from 6 June 1979. We estimate that some 8,000 disabled people aged 60 and under will be able to claim the allowance. We are taking every step open to us to publicise this further extension of the allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that honourable Members will want to do all they can to help in this task. We are now approaching the end of the phasing-in programme and the fulfilment of our pledge to bring all eligible age groups within the scheme by the end of 1979. This makes it all the more important for us to ensure that no entitled disabled person loses the allowance through ignorance of the scheme or uncertainty about eligibility. There is nothing worse than for honourable Members on both sides of the House to work for social improvements only to find that some of those most in need of benefit are unaware of what is available to them. All of us must try to ensure the people are made aware that women will now have the same rights as men to claim mobility allowance up to the age of 65. They are being brought into the scheme in the same way and at the same time as men. Like men, they will also be able to benefit up to the age limit for retention of the allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far we have included in the scheme people who are aged between 5 and 60 and, as I said earlier, we have now added a further 8,000 or so beneficiaries to the 90,000 others already receiving mobility help for the very first time. Two more age groups will follow later in the year to bring in the remaining beneficiaries up to the age of 65. People aged 61 and 62 will be brought in next, followed by those aged 63 to 64. I shall be making further statements about these age groups as soon as possible, since I well understand the anxiety of people who are approaching
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0668">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
the age of 65 and who want to know when they will be eligible for the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one provision in the new Social Security Act of which I am anxious that those bordering on the age of 65 should be made fully aware. It will apply after the phasing-in programme is complete. It affects those eligible in an age group which has been covered by a commencement order, who find out after their sixty-fifth birthday that they ought to have put in their claim before they became 65. Under this provision they may not be too late to claim. We have given them a period of grace up to their sixty-sixth birthday to put in a claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is established that they could have been successful in claiming by the age of 65, they will still get the allowance. It is true that they can be paid only from the date of their claim, so it is most important that they should not delay in applying for the allowance. The extension of the age limit for receipt of the mobility allowance and the provision of equal treatment for women will add about £35 million a year to the cost of the scheme in the long run. That estimate is based on the current rate of £10 a week. The honourable Lady asked me about uprating, and I shall say a word about that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present measure, with its counterpart for women, will quickly increase expenditure. As I have said, about 20,000 women are expected to benefit now that they are able to claim up to the age of 65, and this in itself accounts for £10 million of the total additional cost of £35 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned earlier in the debate, our expenditure will continue to rise, at 1978 prices and without adjustment or upratings and other variations, to some £90 million in the financial year 1979–80. By the financial year 1980–81 it will reach £96 million. This represents very considerable progress, but many will still say that it is not enough. They want the complete removal of the upper age limit. Yet the cost of that change is estimated at £260 million a year at current rates, and expenditure of such magnitude cannot be contemplated at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are people who seem to want to increase all the parts of public expenditure
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
while reducing the totality. You and I were taught, Sir Thomas, in a certain place of learning, that the sum is often greater than its parts. It seems to me that we are now often faced with the proposition that the sum is less than its parts. If we are to reduce the totality of public expenditure, we shall have to decrease the parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend and I accept our responsibility for having very substantially increased expenditure on disabled people. Honourable Members will be aware that we have undertaken to uprate the mobility allowance annually. We have also pledged ourselves to inflation-proof the allowance, starting from November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the rate of any increase, we are obliged by statute to have regard to the national economic situation, to the general standard of living, to any changes in taxation which directly affect the cost of motoring for recipients of the allowance, and finally, to such other matters as my right honourable Friend thinks relevant. We fully accepted the principle that changes in taxation should be a factor to be taken into account. We have also accepted that my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State should lay a statement before Parliament setting out his conclusion about the rate of an uprating and his reasons for that conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Braintree (Mr. Newton) played an important part in the establishment of these requirements. It is impossible for me to announce the amount of the uprating today. But I can say, in emphasis, that we shall take all the factors I have mentioned fully into account and give our conclusion at the earliest possible date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Wallasey referred to cardiac and respiratory cases. She was concerned about the role of the general practitioner. Decisions are made by independent statutory authorities, and they take into account all the medical evidence which is available. They can ask for additional evidence if they consider it necessary. We are now in the process of revising guidance to medical practitioners. The new guidelines will emphasise, as did the earlier version, the fact that cardiac and respiratory disorders are to be taken
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
into account in considering a person's capacity to walk, particularly in relation to the exertion involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady also asked me about the effect of the proposed phasing-out of vehicle excise duty. In announcing on 23 January the Government's acceptance of the principle that any changes in motoring taxation which directly affect motoring costs, should be taken into account at each annual review of the mobility allowance rate, I assured the House that the interests of disabled people would be kept well to the fore in the ensuing inter-departmental discussions and consultations with industry that are now taking piace. I am watching developments very closely and I shall make a statement to the House as soon as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady gave her assessment of the importance of the mobility allowance scheme. I know that she agrees with me that the scheme represents an important step forward for disabled people. I should like to quote from a letter that I have received from one beneficiary, a young disabled woman. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I became totally paralysed after the birth of my son seven years ago, and although I have slowly regained most of the use of my limbs, I still have to use elbow crutches. For the first few years I felt almost suicidal. All I ever did was to sit indoors watching television from morning till night. Then I was given a mobility allowance, and it allowed me to go out occasionally in a mini-cab to visit my parents …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Now—and I still cannot believe it—we are going to have a car, through Motability. We are absolutely over the moon! At last we shall be able to visit people, go out at weekends, and we are even planning to have a holiday next year—our first ever. Thanks to"— the new scheme—"there is a whole new life opening up to us. Suddenly, being disabled is not so dreadful any more".</p></blockquote>
I know that the mobility allowance has very widespread support both in the House and in the country. It has done much to normalise the lives of many disabled people. At the same time, I accept that there is much more for us still to do. Mobility allowance is an important new benefit in the sphere of constant progress. Obviously, we cannot solve all outstanding problems at once, but problems are being solved and not shelved. This is because we care deeply about the quality of life for
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
disabled people. I am confident that we shall achieve still further progress. After all, making progress is what mobility for the disabled is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.42 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to welcome the regulations before us. The honourable Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker) alluded to some criticism by her colleagues of the timing of these regulations and the order. It is regrettable that this criticism could not have been translated into actual attendance in the Committee. All I can see in front of me— with the exception of the back of our Whip, which is preferable to the front—is a sea of gold portcullises on green upholstery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we should pay more attention to the problems of the disabled. Certainly we should congratulate the Minister on the great deal that he has done to improve the lot of the disabled. We should also congratulate those Ministers of Parliament who have assisted him—often harried him—in order to achieve that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, of all days, is one for briefly taking stock of the mobility allowance and what the Government have done. The check-list of achievements in relation to the disabled provides a record of which we can be rightly proud. The Minister has told us of some of the things for which he has been responsible. The position of the disabled—which at one time, as described in the letter, was to remain quietly at home and to be forgotten, sometimes, by family and certainly by friends and others—has dramatically changed, and although there is still a long way to go, enormous strides have been made during the past few years. The Minister deserves an enormous pat on the back for this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the achievements in the Government's record has been in the mobility allowance area. Like others on both sides of the Committee, I welcome the gradual extension to all up to retirement age. However, what we are considering here is the confusion that emerged under the original 1975 legislation. I was pleased to be a member of the Committee which considered that. Clearly, it was thought then
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
that all those suffering from physical disablement would be able to be assisted with mobility allowance. But there has since been considerable confusion about the payment of the allowance to people suffering from a physical condition which results in a mental handicap and prevents them from walking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should all be grateful for the wise decision of R. J. A. Temple, the Chief Commissioner, and for the fact that the Secretary of State responded so swiftly to that decision. At the time, my right honourable Friend said that he thought that he ought to make regulations for the avoidance of doubt and that he hoped to place a draft before the National Insurance Advisory Committee and then to lay the regulations before the House as soon as possible. He went on to say that his aim was to ensure that people who had a physical condition which resulted in a mental handicap and as a consequence were unable to walk received mobility allowance. He made the point that this would include all those suffering from Down's Syndrome who were unable or virtually unable to walk but that he could not, of course, include those unable to walk by reason of mental disablement alone. That was an important statement, and I am pleased that these regulations have been laid before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome, too, what my honourable Friend the Member for Eccles (Mr. Carter-Jones) said. I hope that a coach and four will indeed be driven through these regulations, which may, I hope, have been deliberately left open for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's comments about the need for the disabled to be aware of their rights should also be echoed here. Very often, when a person who is in receipt of or seeking to gain a benefit comes before the system, however tolerant and humane the officers within that system may be, clearly it is the underprivileged and the deprived who usually lose out. In the interests of equity, and in the interests of disabled people and other deprived groups getting their rights, more must be done to remedy this imbalance. There is no point in having a fine appeals mechanism if the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
people eligible to go before it have to go along virtually unrepresented. In my own area, I am pleased to see that the Manpower Services Commission has funded the advice and representation project which will enable people in the category we are discussing and others to go to people who are highly qualified and who will seek to represent them before the tribunal mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what the Minister said about how the mobility allowance scheme is to be extended. I hope that a great deal of publicity will be given not only to the regulations before us today but to his comments on who further will benefit. The case of young Mr. Edmunds represents an obvious deficiency in the original legislation. Several of those deficiencies have been removed. I hope that any further anomalies will soon also be eradicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major point I wish to make briefly now is not that there have been deficiencies or anomalies, but that the Government have recognised those deficiencies and anomalies and have been prepared to eradicate them. I hope that people such as Robert and others who have in the past been short-changed will now get the entitlement they so richly deserve. A great deal has been done, and a great deal remains to be done to improve the quality of life for the disabled in this country. The record of the Government in achieving that goal is highly commendable. It is important to reaffirm our commitment to the disadvantaged and to the vulnerable groups within our society and to help to relieve their suffering. I hope that what we are considering today will be given a great deal of publicity and that this will lead to a richer, fuller and more mobile life for tens of thousands of disabled people who, I think for the first time in their lives or in the lives of their predecessors, can rightly say that their plight has not been forgotten by Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.48 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter-Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by referring possibly to your background, Sir Thomas, and to my own, in the sense that we were both brought up in the South Wales mining valleys, we now both have Lancashire
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
seats, and we both have coal mines within our areas. You and I have probably run surgeries with coal miners and have known that they probably have bronchitis, emphysema or pneumoconiosis. We know that these people are incapable of walking and that in the past they could not get mobility allowance. I am delighted that under paragraph 3 (1) (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) of the schedule these people will now be covered, because we know full well that people with miners' diseases cannot cope with the physical effort of walking 100 yards. Yet, as I said in my intervention to my honourable Friend, we have had them struggling to our surgeries saying "Can't I get it?" In the past, we could not get it for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point arises from what was said by the honourable Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker)—I call her my honourable Friend. There are diseases in which it is possible to be examined when one is in a good condition. One in particular is multiple sclerosis. That is a disease where there is remission from time to time. Sometimes, too, there is relief from arthritis. If one happens to be examined on the day when things are going well, one will not get the benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am asking for a wider interpretation of the number of appeals that can be made, so that the doctor can see the patient on a bad day instead of a good day. I am convinced that a large number of people have been turned down because on the day they were examined they were feeling reasonably well. I am glad that the Minister offered to say that there will be more emphasis in future on the evidence given by the family doctor. I do not believe that an independent medical organisation should lightly override the views of a GP. One has to accept that a GP is often sympathetic. Nevertheless, I believe that he should carry rather more weight than he seems to carry at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other move forward that impresses me is the fact that the mentally handicapped—those with Down's Syndrome— will now have a chance of getting the benefit. Those of us on both sides of the House who are involved in that subject are deeply aware that one is often looking not at a single handicap but at a multiple
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
handicap, including mental and physical disability. My honourable Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) said that I had suggested that a coach and horses could be driven through the regulations. I really meant it. Everyone who comes to my surgery from now on will be told "Appeal, appeal, appeal. There is enough in paragraph 3 (1) (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) of the schedule for you to get the benefit you deserve".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As chairman of the Labour Party mental health committee, I welcome this step towards the recognition of the handicap of inability to move that is experienced by the mentally handicapped. If people cannot obtain the benefit directly, on grounds of mental handicap, I shall advise people to say "I can't let him out by himself".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end on a note of congratulation. I suppose that, in some ways, the Minister is one of my closest friends. I recognise the tremendous work that he has done. There must be times when he thinks that I am also his greatest enemy. I say to him here and now: "You have done a great job. You have gone a long way. But I shall still be putting pressure on you".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.53 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Newton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only briefly. I wish, first, to add my congratulations from this side of the Committee to the Minister for what he has achieved— admittedly, under a good deal of pressure from many people, but he has used that pressure to good purpose over the years. I wish, too, to thank him for his brief reference to my small part in improving one part of the provisions—in pressing, during proceedings on the recent Social Security Bill, for improvements in the range of factors that have to be taken into account in reviewing the mobility allowance. I look forward to the results of that review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very glad to see the regulations extending the scope of the mobility allowance which have just been referred to by the honourable Member for Eccles (Mr. Carter-Jones). I recall that one of my earliest impressions as a relatively new Member of Parliament, some four or five years ago, in talking to people who had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
had problems in getting the mobility allowance, was that it seemed very unfairly restricted by the rigorous criteria that were laid down. Indeed, at a meeting of the all-party Disablement Group, I remember making that point to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that it has been difficult to get changes through. But here we have a change, and I agree with the honourable Gentleman that it could be wide in scope. If I were responsible for the Government's expenditure, I might be less willing to welcome it than I am, but having a major interest in the problems of the disabled, I welcome it very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister a specific question—arising from what the honourable Gentleman said in his intervention—about how these regulations are to be brought to the attention of people who may have been turned down in the past. If I understood the Minister correctly, he said that his officials had examined some 22,000 cases and identified 50 people who might benefit. But, unless my concentration lapsed, he was only talking about a small section of the people —those suffering from Down's Syndrome —who might be affected by the changes, not the whole range of people who might now be brought in under the widening of the regulations. There is a serious problem here. We are talking about people who may have already appealed—having been turned down in the past—and who will have it firmly established in their minds that they are not entitled to mobility allowance. It will be difficult to convince them that there has been such a substantial change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister consider whether, in these exceptional circumstances, it might be possible for his Department, over a period, to send a note to all those on the files whose cases have been turned down in the past, stating that there has been a significant change in the regulations? I recognise that this is a fairly large administrative task, but to those honourable Members who may have to have a range of ladies addressing election envelopes to 70,000 to 80,000 electors— which will have to be done in a few days in the next week or so—it would not seem
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
to be an impossible task to circulate some notification to those who have been turned down. I hope that that will be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question relates to the phasing-in programme. The Minister reaffirmed his hope that it would be completed by the end of this year. He said that there was much anxiety among those who had formed the impression that their age was—as it were—always moving ahead of the phasing-in programme. They fear that they will reach 65 before they are reached at all. We can assure those people who come to see us that they will be reached in due time. But that anxiety remains. The Minister said that there were just two more age groups to be brought in—the 61–62 age group, and the 63–64 age group—and that the process would be completed by the end of 1979. But it ought to be possible now to give a definite date for when claims will be accepted from these remaining groups. There can only be a small range of possibilities between April 1979 and December 1979 for dates when this will start. I believe that much anxiety would be removed if something clear cut and definite was said now about the remainder of this phasing-in programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to those two constructive points. But the principal purpose of my remarks is to congratulate him on what he has achieved, and added to with these regulations today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.57 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly add a word of explanation and also a word of thanks? I begin by thanking you, Mr. Chairman, for your tolerance in this Committee today, when our debates have ranged a good deal wider than the scope of the instruments before us. I feel that it is worth saying that for the sake of the record-writers and those who read 	<i>Hansard,</i> who may seek in Statutory Instruments Nos. 171 and 172 some of the matters explained by the Minister. We do not regret that he has given publicity to the wider issues, particularly as there may not be many more chances—we do not know—and it is important to have them on the record. I did not refer to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
them because they were not contained in the instruments before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I had hoped that the Minister would give us more information about the size of the increase of the mobility allowance. But, like him, I do not expect miracles—just small miracles from time to time. 1 am pleased that my honourable Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newton) was so persistent and ensured that there would be a statement, and that a much fuller consideration of all those factors affecting the uprating of mobility allowance should now be enshrined in our legislation. I am very grateful to him for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the Minister has something else to say, but we are grateful for this opportunity to put a lot of these matters on the record this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very grateful to my honourable Friends and to honourable Members opposite for the references they have made to the regulations and to the order. They referred also to the preparatory work that was done, for which I am grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my honourable Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) will have been helped by my explanation of the regulations this morning. I hope that there may be disabled people whom he knows who will benefit from the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Eccles (Mr. Carter-Jones) said that he thought that he could drive a horse and cart through the regulations. We have had escalation since his intervention. We are now told that it would be possible to drive a coach and four through the regulations. I hope that it will stop before we reach
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
the level of a jumbo jet. My honourable Friend is very trusting of the Government. He has told us his intentions. Normally, right honourable and honourable Members await the fact of driving a coach and four or any other piece of transport through regulations before they declare their intentions. I have said that there will be many people who wish my honourable Friend all possible luck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend was referring to people who feel well one day and very unwell the next and who have their medical examination on the day when they are better in health than is normal. But they can appeal. If they have a good day and a bad day the next, the process of appeal is important to them. But that is not the end of the road. They can apply again for the mobility allowance. I emphasise that anyone who has lost on appeal still has the possibility of applying for the allowance all over again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Braintree (Mr. Newton) asked me some questions. On the matter of Down's syndrome and the work that we have done within the Department to try to find people who can benefit from the regulations, we shall consider the implications of what he said. We are reluctant to raise false hopes at present, but we shall look very carefully and sympathetically at his suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also spoke about the phasing-in of new age groups. This depends very much on the number of claims in the current phase. We shall do all we possibly can to announce both phases together when we make our next statement.
