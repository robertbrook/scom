	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment (Mr. Denis Howell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Water Charges Equalisation Order 1978.</p></blockquote>
Before I make a few opening remarks on the order, may I with your indulgence, Mr. Costain, refer to the fact that, as I think I am right in saying that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Jones) has announced his intention not to stand again for Membership of the House, this may be the last occasion on which we shall have the pleasure of his company on these water matters. I wish to take this opportunity to say that he has been a very tough adversary but we on the Government side of the Committee, and of the House have always respected his fairness and firmness and his contribution to what has been a very difficult Session for water legislation. I am sure that the water industry is grateful, as the Government are, for the attitude that the hon. Member has always displayed, and we wish him well for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As will be appreciated by the Committee, the legislation from which these matters are derived was subject to a certain amount of controversy when it was introduced, but I think that we can claim in this second year that we have had to make an order that it is working extremely well. It was, indeed, at the suggestion of the hon. Member for Daventry and his colleagues that the private water companies were brought within the ambit of the order. Like the regional water authorities, some gain quite considerably from the principles applied in the order while others have to contribute some of their revenue in order to bring that about. But the Government remain convinced of the equity and fairness of the order and these processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main features of the scheme used to calculate the levies and payments remain almost exactly as they were last year. The financing charges—both interest and depreciation—element of expenditure in-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
curred before 31st March 1976, which is the base date, in the provision of water supply are divided by the number of properties with an unmeasured supply in order to give us the unit cost. An average unit cost is thereby obtained, and an individual unit cost for each authority and company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional water authorities and the water companies with a unit cost below the national average pay into the equalisation pool and those with a unit cost above the national average receive from the pool. For the purposes of making this calculation, 38 such regional water authorities and private companies gave information in response to the detailed questionnaire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation process for this order took the form of a small working group comprising representatives from my Department, the Welsh Office, the National Water Council and the Water Companies Association, so I can assure the Committee that all the interested parties have been involved in the calculations and I do not think that there is any cause for concern as to the factual basis of the calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come directly now to the effect of the order. On our present estimates, it will reduce the range in the cost of water supplied for mainly domestic consumers in unmeasured bills from about 43 per cent, above the average and 45 per cent, below the average—which is a tremendous range—to 33 per cent, above and 34 per cent, below.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the order is substantially to give assistance to Wales and the Southwest where consumers have traditionally faced much higher charges than in the rest of the country. It will reduce the average unmeasured bills about £3.27 for Wales and £2.21 for the South-West. In percentage terms, that means that the average bill for the South-West will be brought down from 43 per cent, above the national average to 33 per cent., while the same calculation for Wales will reduce bills from about 31 per cent, of the national average to 17 per cent, above the national average. The order will therefore carry out the wishes of the House and the Government on charging policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other side of the calculation, I should say something about the authorities making the biggest contribution. This year it is the Southern Water Authority area, where the average bill will rise by about 4 per cent, from £22.25 to £23.15. Even after that increase the average Southern bill will remain about 3 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
below the national average. I think that is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the private company consumers those served by the Mid-Sussex Water Company will benefit most from the scheme. Their average unmeasured bills will be reduced by over £4 and will thus fall from 41 per cent, above the national average to about 24 per cent, above the national average. So the order has an important benefit for those consumers and justifies the Opposition's view that the private companies should be brought into the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In West Hampshire where the average bill is over 42 per cent, below the national average, very considerably below the national average, consumers will face the largest percentage increase. Average unmeasured bills will increase by 23 per cent,—from £13.86 to £17.07—but they will still remain 29 per cent, below the national average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that the provisions of the Water Charges Equalisation Act 1977 have been successfully implemented. The order will even out the spread of the financial legacy of the past historic charges, which is its main purpose, and will give assistance to those domestic consumers who cannot, by their own actions, influence the charge for their own water supply. The desired objective has been achieved. I hope that that introduction will assist the Committee in its deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.38 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve on a Committee opposite the right hon. Gentleman the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment. I value the kind remarks with which he opened our proceedings. I reciprocate his expression of appreciation and thank him for the courteous way in which he has always dealt with points I have raised—they have been many and varied—down the years during which he has had this responsibility in the Department of the Environment. The right hon. Gentleman is always most purposeful in his advocacy, and I have tried to mirror that in what I have had to say. We have never allowed any personal differences of view to affect our relationship. I am grateful to him for the way in which we have always been able to look at these matters together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the order before us—this second annual ritual of the water
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
charges equalisation arrangements—is of any great moment. We might be getting into a similar situation as on the rate support grant, where arrangements have to be reviewed every year. We shall be dealing with that later this week on the Floor of the House. I remember the right hon. Gentleman joining me in saying that he never understood the figures anyway. Few people do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of my purpose this morning is to see to what extent the Minister of State is able to make these figures comprehensible, as set out in schedule 1. They represent a list of the movement of moneys from and to various water authorities and water undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to hear the Minister add to the assurance that he gave us last year—
	<br><blockquote><p>"First, I must say that the scheme works."—[	<i>Official Report, Second Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments,</i> &c, 14th December 1977; C.4.]</p></blockquote>
Now he says that it is working extremely well. We must be getting used to making it work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman pointed out that there are benefits for some and added costs for others. What significance has the Act had for the industry and the consumer? This is a minnow of a measure. That view is supported by the figures given this morning by the Minister. He said that domestic consumers of unmetered water supply in Wales and the South-West will benefit—as I worked it out—by 60p per week. That is no significant sum for those in receipt of it; nor is the corresponding sum—we have not been given the figures quite so definitely so I cannot say how much more it is—for consumers paying in those areas where there is a transfer out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are going through the annual routine of this equalisation order in terms of a cost of 60p per week. The arrangements were not sought either by the industry or by the consumers. One wonders what it cost to put the order into operation. Do Departments tell Ministers when they come forward with schemes such as this "It will cost this much or that much to put the scheme into operation first of all?" First, there is the cost of introducing the measure. Then there are the annual costs, such as our proceedings this morning and all that has gone before to establish the figures contained in the order. What did it cost the industry—the RWAs—to give the information initially to enable this order
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
to be drafted, introduced and processed? What did it cost the private water companies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman and some members of the Committee will remember the discussions that took place some years ago with the various interests. Every hour costs quite a lot of money. I wonder what these chaps charge themselves out at—£10 or £15 an hour? I do not know. But when the figures are added, they come to quite a significant sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the expenses in the Department? I do not say that Members of Parliament charge themselves out at £10 or £15 an hour, but one has only to look at some of the Departmental staff here this morning to know that they would not think of charging their time at anything less than that. Then, too, there are the parliamentary costs, the time of the individuals involved, the overheads and the out-of-pocket expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the annual cost of this exercise? I do not know. I could hazard a guess, but I shall not do so because that is not part of my case. But it would be interesting to know just how much this measure has cost. When one looks at its effects, I am sure that one would have great difficulty in justifying the costs that were initially involved, and the annual costs, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When matters of any significance are introduced, proposals should be considered, as I said, against the background of a cost-benefit analysis. I myself doubt whether this measure would pass any test on that ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must consider, too, that it is all an on-cost to the consumer. It is probably not from the central Government standpoint, but for the water authorities and private companies all the work involved is an on-cost to the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The memorandum dated 22nd November, put out by the Department helped to elaborate the text of the statutory instrument. In the Standing Committee on 14th December last year we were told that the detailed questionnaire to which the right hon. Gentleman referred was completed by 38 undertakers in early October last year. Information was then based upon the best estimates that one could obtain, and final figures were not available until the completion of undertakers' accounts. One realises the problem there because the water undertakers have their financial year
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
at varying dates. But then the right hon. Gentleman said that the differences
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be taken account of in next year's order."—[	<i>Official Report, Second Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, &c.,</i> 14th December 1977; c.4]</p></blockquote>
What were the differences last year and how had they to be taken into account in reaching the figures for this year? In other words, how much was the right hon. Gentleman out last year, and to what extent has he had to make the adjustment in this year's figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, as this is the most pertinent point to be raised this morning. I raised it myself, of course, and came prepared to give the answer. However, I have to disappoint the Committee by saying that because of the accountancy year, particularly with some of the private companies, it has not yet been possible for them to supply that information. So I have to amend the phrase "next year" to "future accounts."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a proper question for the hon. Gentleman to raise, but I cannot give any valuable information to the Committee on that matter for this year, as it is not included in this year's calculations because the financial year does not end at the appropriate time as regards our calculations. I have no doubt that next year what the sum total will mean is that instead of being one year behind in adjusting any discrepancy we shall, in fact, be two years behind so long as the Bill is operative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be sorry not to be here next year to hear what the right hon. Gentleman says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Alec Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall send the hon. Gentleman a copy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an undertaking. But some of the water undertakers accounts close on 31st December and most of them would close in the first three or four months of a year, so I should have thought that some eight or nine months after the companies have prepared their annual accounts it would be reasonable enough for the shortfall which was not known last year to be included in the total sum for this year. We are a year behind. That is the point I am trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that some of the water authority companies
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
close their accounts in September; their 12 months therefore include part of the year from last year, and the calculations cannot be done until we have the information based on the end of their financial year, which, as I say, is in September, six months later than our calculations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, but it demonstrates how tiny these figures are. I know the amounts involved in terms of the differences, but I think that they will not be significant in terms of the total amount. I know that in the passage of time there must be adjustments. I do not labour the point, but it is something that we are entitled to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales also dealt with this point last year. But what he said was quite extraordinary:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The water authorities have regarded the information provided to us as being private, but we shall certainly take the point up with them and see whether we can get information from them to resolve the problem—if it is a problem that needs to be checked."</p></blockquote>
It is extraordinary that information upon which calculations have to be made are private to the Government, presumably. I do not see how that can be so. The Under-Secretary of State went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Information from public authorities normally should be available and the Government undertake to hold the consultations to ensure that the water companies have the necessary information, if they want it, to make the sort of checks the hon. Gentleman referred to."</p></blockquote>
Those two statements do not hang together very well. The hon. Gentleman went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is true that because it is a new scheme and this is the first order under the Act there might be minor defects in the actual calculations, and that is why, as my right hon. Friend the Minister of State said to the Committee, any discrepancies which occur in the figures would be adjusted in subsequent orders."</p></blockquote>
Now we have been told that that will not happen—not in the next order, anyway. In subsequent orders, of course, but that could mean any time.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Difficulties will arise"—</p></blockquote>
the hon. Gentleman is perhaps more cautious than his right hon. Friend—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for instance, when we come to adjusting orders to take into account the discrepancies."</p></blockquote>
I do not know what will happen when we reach that stage. But it demonstrates the loose way in which this whole matter has been dealt with. Just as in the case of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the rate support grant order, it is left to the Minister to make up his mind which way he wants the money to move. That is what this is all about—just as it is with the rate support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the gentleman who drafted this order was as careful as the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. Whoever drafted this order said at the top of page 2 of the memorandum:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The form of questionnaires was devised by the Secretary of State after full consultation."</p></blockquote>
I looked up "devised" in the Oxford dictionary, which gives:
	<br><blockquote><p>"assign, give … by will … plan … invent, plot, scheme."</p></blockquote>
I rest my case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is being selective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the full quotation. I have not left anything out of the Oxford dictionary, except a few root words. So, if "devised" is the proper word, it supports my case that what is happening is that the resources are moved in and out at almost the whim of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary for Wales mentioned on the same occasion
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government's objective of equalising the charges which domestic consumers have to pay for their water supply."—[	<i>Official Report, Second Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, &c,</i> 14th December 1977; c. 13–14.]</p></blockquote>
I know that is fundamental to the Act, but it was strange that the right hon. Gentleman used the same phrase this year as that which he and his hon. Friend used last year—
	<br><blockquote><p>"consumers who are unable by their own efforts to influence the amount they are charged for this most basic of human needs."—[	<i>Official Report, Second Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, &c.,</i> 14th December 1977; c. 5.]</p></blockquote>
We did not go to the "most basic of human needs" this time, but he mentioned those who are unable by their own efforts to influence the amount they are charged. That is fundamental to this whole exercise. These objectives do nothing to encourage good management in the industry. Competence in running the private water companies or the regional water authorities is not to have its own reward. There is to be no recognition that it is more or less costly to provide suppliers in varying circumstances, for which there should be some recognition in terms of higher charges. In the words of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Under-Secretary of State for Wales, we are working towards every domestic consumer paying the same price—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government's objective of equalising the charges which domestic consumers have to pay for their water supply."</p></blockquote>
So he is saying that we are trying to bring about a situation in which every domestic consumer pays the same amount. That is a denial of sound management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from being a denial of sound management, the Government's policy is a denial, too, of sensible charging policies. These are being looked at and are being made increasingly sophisticated by the regional water authorities and the private water companies. New methods of charging and differing tariffs are being introduced, the purpose being to ensure the optimum use of our resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In support of my case that political considerations had some weight in the purpose of the order, I quote the words of the right hon. Gentleman during the Committee stage of the Water Charges Equalisation Bill, when replying to my earlier comments:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that these are political considerations, or administrative considerations by politicians."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee</i> B, 24th February 1977; c. 423.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an admission that this was a political exercise mainly directed towards helping consumers in Wales. The annual ritual underlines the Government's naivety in introducing politics into water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.57 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is traditional in the House and in Committee to declare one's interest. I declare an equalisation of interest, as I pay rates to an authority under schedule 1, the Thames Water Authority, and therefore shall be subject to the equalisation levy, and I also pay rates to an authority in schedule 2, the Welsh Water Authority and to that extent I shall receive an equalisation payment. I shall, therefore, have a happy equalisation myself in my own interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the description of this order by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Jones) as a minnow of a measure. That appears to conflict with his final argument that it was a political measure.
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
If it was such a minnow, it could hardly have the political effects and advantages which he ascribed to it. Clearly, the disparities between areas will still remain,
During debates on the Bill, in discussions about why these disparities had arisen, there were a number of allegations, particularly from the Opposition, that the disparities were due in some way to perhaps almost moral turpitude or gross inefficiency on the part of those authorities which would be paying into the equalisation fund. This was echoed today by the hon. Member for Daventry—I picked up a quotation from him—that competence will not have its own reward as a result of this equalisation measure. Those disparities which exist are largely due to factors beyond the control of any one authority. In particular, in my own authority, the Welsh Water Authority, one thinks of the vast extra sums which have to be incurred through simple reasons of geography—the topography of Wales—and the vast costs of providing water to rural communities, due not to any incompetence or inefficiency but to basic topographical facts which no one can gainsay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will not seek to imply that the deficit authorities, such as those in Wales, are such because of any inefficiency or incompetence on their part in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, however, that this is only an element of equalisation, modest and limited, and, as my right hon. Friend has pointed out, in Wales, for example, even after this measure, we shall still be 17 per cent, above the national average. The hon. Member for Daventry made the point of the small benefit—and if his figures are correct the benefit will be only 60p per week. The first answer to that is that if there were a national water authority there should be no problem because there would be no disparities. The second is that, being in the House of Commons, we may with our income levels think that 60p per week is a rather insignificant sum. But we are all, as Members of Parliament, brought down to earth when we go to our constituencies and meet people in our surgeries for whom 60p per week is a substantial sum and one that is not rebated. So I do not accept the argument that 60p a week is of small benefit, and the argument will not be accepted by ratepayers in areas such as those of the Anglian Water Authority, the South-West Water

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Authority and Wales, which will benefit from this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one or two questions for my hon. Friend who will be answering. Looking at the two orders, although the formula has been the same for both I note what appears to be a difference in the proportion paid by separate authorities. Perhaps my hon. Friend could explain the reason for this difference in spite of a similar formula to be applied year by year. One can call the consideration political if one wishes to use "political" as a pejorative word. I should prefer to use the word "fairness", and the reaction of domestic ratepayers in my own area and, no doubt, in the South-West and Anglian Water Authority areas would be that this modest measure brings relief to them. Certainly, in Wales had this modest measure not been accepted there would have been pressures, following the Daniel Committee, for surcharges, for commercial pricing and for something very different which would have been even more unwelcome to the hon. Member and his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.3 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that we are all anxious to get away, but I should reply to some of the points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reply, first, to the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) about the differences. I should explain that there were certain problems which we discovered to have been created by the fact that, although we had the basic principle right on which the calculations should be made, in practice some of the regional water authorities were using different criteria in establishing that basic principle. I think that that was sorted out in the first year, and it accounts for the difference to which my hon. Friend referred. I am grateful to him for reminding us that consumers with the Anglian Water Authority also gain substantially as a result of this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to reply to the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Jones), who will not mind me saying that this year he has had 12 months in which to study the speech I made last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I study them always.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, but he will not mind my saying that such marked study has had an appreciable effect upon the quality of his criticisms and will cause me
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
to spend a minute or two replying to him. It is nice to know that one's speeches in this place are read. You and I, Mr. Costain, have laboured here for many years under the impression that only the Members who make speeches read them. But the hon. Gentleman is confounding that parliamentary heresy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend that £30 a year, which 60p represents—if that is the correct calculation—must be taken into account, together with other domestic charges, particularly for some of the less wealthy residents of Wales, Anglia and the South-West. In practice, domestic consumers do not divide the water rate, as they still call it—in fact it is not a rate but a water charge—from their general rates and their other household costs, and they would regard that as a degree of equity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me a technical question about how much the preparation and administration of the order has cost. I do not have any detailed figures, and I do not suppose he wants me to set in motion what would be a costly exercise to find out how much it cost, but I can say that it is negligible. In these days, when most water authorities have computers and the industry as a whole is very computerised, one would not have thought that there was need for great concern on that account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the private companies and the difficulty of adjusting this year any inaccuracies from last year, as we had intended, I again confirm that at least two of the important water authorities, and probably more of the private companies, have a financial year very different from that of the regional water authorities. Indeed, I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales for reminding me that that was why we first left out the private companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on the Committee considering the Water Charges Equalisation Bill will remember that we discussed it at some length and considered that the difference would make it extremely difficult to bring them in for the purposes of equalisation. But we brought them in. All one can say is that the difficulties that have occurred were exactly those which we forecast. But I apologise to the Committee that I used the phrase "next year" when I should have been more precise and followed my hon. Friend's example of saying "subsequent years".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with the grave and terrible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
charge made against us that we are engaged in politics. This is a charge which the hon. Gentleman, on the eve of his departure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not know that. From what I have been reading in the press, I have gained the impression that we may be going tomorrow. If I can ever be sure, I shall convey the fact to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister immediately. He will be happy to receive it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with this question of politics. I start by saying, as my hon. Friend said and as I have said on many occasions, that everything that the hon. Gentleman has been saying is a total contradiction of the way in which gas, electricity and Post Office charges are determined for people in this country. Householders in the United Kingdom, whether they be in John o'Groats, Land's End or any point between them, pay their gas, electricity and Post Office bills on the basis that each service is being run by one nationalised industry. Therefore, there has, sensibly, always been equalisation. If there were not, there would be serious anxiety about the break-up of the United Kingdom—if, for example, people in the Orkneys and Shetlands were charged the actual cost of having their post delivered or collected compared with what those of us living and working in London had to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those principles are well known, and to that extent my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East and some of his colleagues might be justified in complaining that this measure does not go far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth asking why we have got into this difficulty so that we have to have some measure of equity and equalisation brought into our proceedings. The reason is that, when it nationalises, the Conservative Party is not very experienced in the matter and does not know how to go about it. Thus, instead of creating one nationalised water authority, which would make sense, it created nine all different from one another. I have not been able to fathom the logic of that. I objected to it at the time, while accepting the principle of the Bill which was that water should be dealt with on the hydrological cycle. Nevertheless, in the mechanics of the machinery which the Conservatives created it was a
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
nonsense. To a large extent, it remains a nonsense, and that is one of the reasons why, when we can, we shall introduce another Water Bill to get some of these things put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that, in his quieter moments, I should carry the hon. Gentleman with me when I say that the National Water Council was established as an umbrella body over the 10 regional water authorities but, for example, it was given no strategic planning powers. That is absolute rubbish when we have to consider such questions as to whether more reservoirs should be built in Wales, on what terms, on what sort of financing, and where that water shall go, whether it shall come to the Midlands, whether it should go to assist in Wessex or whether it should—as might happen in future years if the growth in consumption carries on at its present level—be put into the headwaters of the Thames to assist people in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are extremely important strategic questions which have to be decided at some time. They must be decided at the centre. They cannot be decided by separate water authorities all trying to do their own thing—and, incidentally, creating frictions which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I have to try to iron out between different regional water authorities. That is the justification for the strategy and policy of the Bill which we should prefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the Secretary of State in the end has to take the decision and make the orders, though it is not like the rate support grant. I do not find any difficulty in advising my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State as to what the order should be because all one has to do is to do the arithmetic. The principles are laid down in the Act and there are therefore no judgments necessary which should concern the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member placed much emphasis on the word "devised". We were all fascinated that he repaired to the Library to study the Oxford dictionary. He gave us a permutation to allow us to choose which was the meaning of the word "devised"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the word was "divine" and was about to suggest another definition—"heavenly".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that out of the alternatives that he placed before the Committee as to what the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
word "devised" meant, unhesitatingly, as a good Christian at Christmas, I choose "a sign"—not "assign"—which was one of the alternatives presented to us. I think that this is a sign that we have selected here—that water charging and equalisation is not as equitable as it ought to be and therefore had to be adjusted, having regard to the need for fairness among consumers throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to conclude by thanking you, Mr. Costain, for presiding over our affairs. The Committee has discharged
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
even more assiduously this year than last year its duty of looking at the proposals and assuring itself, in the interests of people in the country, that the order fairly and honestly reflects the purposes of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
