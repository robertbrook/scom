GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL (REVIEW BOARD FOR OVERSEAS QUALIFIED PRACTITIONERS RULES) ORDER OF COUNCIL 1979</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Gerard Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the General Medical Council (Review Board for Overseas Qualified Practitioners Rules) Order of Council 1979 (S.I. No. 29).</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the two orders are clearly linked, I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if with this we were to take the following:
<br><blockquote><p>The General Medical Council (Constitution) Order 1979 (S.I. No. 112).</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy, Mr. Watkins, that we should take the two statutory instruments together, since we do not expect a lengthy debate.<br><br>
I refer first to the order concerning overseas qualified practitioners rules. In Committee on the Medical Act we spent a great deal of time considering the problems of doctors coming into this country from overseas. This was an important part of the Act. We eventually arrived at a solution which appeared to satisfy everybody, which is unusual in this place. It is not surprising, therefore, that now we come to the first order to bring the new arrangements into operation we wish to ask the Government to comment on the progress being made with the Act, and this particular part of it.<br><br>
In the order we see that the board is to consist of four elected members and two appointed members, but no nominated members. As we understand it, this will mean that there will be no lay representation on the board. There is also to be one member—we spent considerable time on this point in Committee—who is the special member, as it were. The idea is that there should always be somebody present who will understand the problems of the overseas doctors. The Committee arrived at this special category to cover that. We had some doubt whether there would always be somebody in this special category on the council who would fulfil this requirement.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
I turn to a slightly different point. Having gone to all this trouble, we see that the board is to consist of seven carefully selected people. It appears surprising, if I understand the position correctly, that at meetings of the board not more than five of those seven are to be present at one time. One of them is to be from the special category. But any three of those five can make the quorum. At that stage, therefore, the whole objective of having the special category person could be lost.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to comment on those points.</span></p>
<p>10.33 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Hodgson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak briefly about the review board and also about the General Medical Council (Constitution) Order.<br><br>
I underline the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan) about the way in which the board can be whittled down. After we have started with a reasonably well balanced committee, the quorum could be as small as three, and that appears to underline many of the difficulties we faced during the Committee stage last year on what became the Medical Act. This order comes under what was then new clause K. That gives some idea how many new clauses there were. We were clearly conducting our debate very much under the gun, because the new clauses were tabled just in time for the Committee stage.<br><br>
A great deal of unease was expressed on both sides of that Committee about the hurried way in which the Bill had been expanded to cover new functions and new suggestions which had not been in the original draft when the Bill was first discussed in the other place. I, too, shall therefore be waiting with interest to hear what the Minister says, because of the concern about this matter. Clearly, I have a particular interest in my own constituency, where a great number of practising doctors are from overseas. The provisions of the order could have a great local impact.<br><br>
I turn now to the General Medical Council (Constitution) Order. I should like the Minister's comments on two or three brief points. I wish to refer to Professor Merrison's report, upon which so much of the Medical Act was based. First, the number chosen for the total constitution of the General Medical Council is, by my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0387">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
arithmetic, 95. Professor Merrison suggested in his report that the number should be 98, and that there should be 54 elected members. Paragraph 397 of the Merrison report reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have said that … the G.M.C. should have on it 54 elected members. If so, the division between constituencies would appear to be fair if as follows: 42 for England, three for Wales, seven for Scotland, and two for Northern Ireland."</p></blockquote>
It would be helpful if the Minister could explain how the difference has been arrived at, why Professor Merrison's recommendation in respect of the elected membership has been departed from, and which particular constituencies—by which I mean England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland—it is proposed should lose elected members.<br><br>
The second point concerns tenure of office. As I understand it, the new G.M.C. will take office on 27 September this year and will hold office until 31 October 1984. Do I take it from that that there will be a complete changeover of the council on that date, or will there be provision in the future for a rollover? In other words, will there be a complete changeover and potentially a complete break with the past, or will there be partial elections or partial nominations or partial appointments to allow for continuity of membership?<br><br>
It would seem, at first glance at any rate, to be undesirable for everybody on the G.M.C. to have to give up office on the same day. There might well be matters in progress through the council which would require people who had previous experience to continue to deal with them. I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on that.<br><br>
I turn to the question of the breakdown between elected, appointed and nominated members. Perhaps the Minister could deal with the position of the chief medical officers for the four constituent parts. This, again, was a matter of some concern when we debated the Medical Bill in Committee. It was strongly felt by certain hon. Members that the nominated members should be from the lay profession, and an amendment to that effect was moved. Although we then accepted the Government's arguments then that there should be an opportunity for the chief medical officers to be nominated, I should be grateful if the Minister could explain what is the latest thinking on this and whether, indeed, it is intended that four of those nominations should be the chief medical officers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Going on from there—and here I pick up a point made by my hon. Friend—could the Minister comment on the question of lay representation? I shall quote from paragraph 383 of Professor Merrison's report:
<br><blockquote><p>"We consider it important that some laymen should participate in the work of the G.M.C. We do not think this participation need be large because the presence of even a few laymen will change the perspective of proceedings, for example by preventing discussions taking place which reflect solely the common background which medical graduates will have."</p></blockquote>
In the light of the interest expressed in Committee in making sure that lay representation is provided for in the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Bill, for example, it would be helpful if the Minister could give us the Government's latest thinking on the methods and proposals for the appointment and sustenance of this lay representation.<br><br>
Could the Minister also give us some idea of the basis for, and the timing of, the electoral scheme for the election of those 50 elected people who will make up the G.M.C.? We should like to hear the latest position on that.<br><br>
Finally, in article 3(6) of the order there is permission for the postponement of elections, which could mean, if I have read the article right, that elections could be postponed for up to two and a half years. It is stated that the interval between elections
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not exceed half the period for which elected members of the General Council currently hold office."</p></blockquote>
Since members will be appointed at the end of 1979 to hold office until 1984, elections could be postponed for up to two and a half years. That seems rather a long time. I understand that there is no desire to hold elections for small numbers of people very frequently, because of the expense and difficulties involved, but if one were to postpone a by-election for two and a half years there would be a big outcry on all sides. Two and a half years is a long time for people to be under-represented, particularly if the vacancy were to occur, say, in Northern Ireland which will have only two representatives. The representation of Northern Ireland by elected members could be effectively halved for a period of two and a half years.<br><br>
I shall be most interested to hear the Minister's comments on those points.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p>10.43 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not realised that my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) intended to deal with the second statutory instrument straight away. I should like to comment on what he has said, if that is to the convenience of the Committee.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is quite right. It is the composition of the nominated members who are to be appointed by the Privy Council about which we are concerned. We should like to know what progress has been made about the type or types of people who are to be nominated.<br><br>
In Chapter 6, Part A, of the original Merrison proposals, the Committee was quite clear on the basic principles of the composition. The first principle put down in the report was that the G.M.C. must be independent. Further on, in paragraph 383, the Committee says that in its view "lay members" means:
<br><blockquote><p>"people other than doctors—in other words nurses or members of other professions, including those supplementary to medicine, would be included."</p></blockquote>
We would specifically ask the Minister whether nurses will be included amongst these lay members. That is a point of importance and interest.<br><br>
Again, the Merrison committee recommended that there should be 10 lay members, not the 11 that the statutory instrument recommends. It said that one should be from Northern Ireland, one from Wales, two from Scotland and six from England. We should like to know whether those numbers will be met, or whether some change is to be made.<br><br>
There are other minor points that I shall perhaps bring up later, depending on the Minister's answer.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave my hon. Friend the Minister to deal with the comments that were made by the hon. Members for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) and Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan). I apologise if I display ignorance in the matter.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend give an indication whether he or members of his Department have held talks with representatives of overseas qualified practitioners in respect of this small piece of proposed legislation? He must be aware that there are a considerable number of overseas qualified doctors in this country who have been here for a long time, who are British subjects
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
and who may have valuable advice to give his Department about the way in which the board conducts its affairs in regard to overseas qualified practitioners. Will my hon Friend allay my fears in this respect?</span></p>
<p>10.46 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Eric Deakins)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many questions have been asked. It may be helpful if I try to deal with them not quite seriatim—since we have gone from one order to the other—but by taking the orders in turn.<br><br>
By way of background, I should like to begin with the comment of the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan) about progress in implementing the Medical Act. The language provisions—section 29 of the Act—came into force on 1 December last year. All doctors entitled to full registration must satisfy the G.M.C. about their knowledge of English.<br><br>
The limited registration provisions— section 22 of the Act—came into force on 15 February 1979, and the review board provisions also came into operation on that date.<br><br>
I shall take the constitution order first, as I believe that, in a sense, it is the wider order. The review board comes under it. Most of the provisions in that order rely heavily, as those hon. Members who are experts in such matters and who serve on committees and so on will appreciate, on the recommendations of the Merrison committee. Therefore there are few surprises for anyone who has followed the reconstitution question through from the beginning.<br><br>
After that report was published in April 1975 we had wide consultation on its contents. Even at a very early stage, there was broad agreement on the recommendations for the future composition of the G.M.C. The Medical Bill was introduced in November 1977, and further discussions with the profession at that time brought us to the point where most of the details of the Merrison recommendations enjoyed wide acceptance.<br><br>
We had a consultation paper in November 1978. It closely followed the Merrison line, and as a result attracted very little controversy. The provisions in the constitution order are the result of a long process of consultation and discussion with the profession and with others who have a close interest in medical matters.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
One of the points raised by the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) concerned the size of the council, the number of elected members, and so on. Certainly, there have been some doubts about the size of the body that is being created. That is understandable, because in some public bodies too large a membership can inhibit and undermine their effectiveness. On the other hand, too small a body could fail adequately to represent the different range of viewpoints that it should.<br><br>
The existing G.M.C., with 46 members, is a body of considerable size. Hon. Members will recall that critics of the council in the late 1960s and early 1970s expressed considerable concern that a council of that size was not fully representative of the profession which it was regulating. The Merrison committee thought carefully about that and concluded that the council had to be large, in order, as the report puts it,
<br><blockquote><p>"to encompass and represent properly all those having a legitimate interest in the standards of the profession"</p></blockquote>
reflected in the committee structure laid down in the Act, for the day-to-day affairs to be undertaken officially by smaller groups.<br><br>
The Merrison recommendations provided for 98 members. The order provides for up to 95. That small reduction was made possible by a reduction in the number of elected members suggested by Merrison. We believe that that small reduction is worth while, in terms of the costs involved—there is, of course, a cost to the G.M.C. in running elections—but it still leaves the elected members with a majority over the other members as the Act requires, which is very important, and by a sufficient margin, which is also important, to allow for casual vacancies arising among elected members. We have taken care to cover this point in our consultation with the British Medical Association which has no objection.<br><br>
The only scope for reducing the size of the council still further, if it were felt that even 95 was rather too large, would have been to reduce the number of appointed members. This would have meant asking certain universities or colleges to combine to make appointments. We mentioned this possibility in our consultation paper but the education bodies were not in favour. I am sure that it would not be right either
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
to force this kind of rationalisation on them or to try to decide that one university or royal college should appoint a member while another should not. That would have been most unwise. So the order provides for all the medical education establishments to appoint members. Each has its own contribution which will be relevant to the work of the council.<br><br>
Looking to the future, on the issue of size I should like to point out that if circumstances should change—if, for example, the universities which have medical schools agreed on some form of joint appointment, which would be entirely up to them—it would be possible to provide for a smaller council by a new order. But our priority now is to get the new more democratic and fully representative council into operation as quickly as possible. I am sure that that view is shared by all hon. Members.<br><br>
As well as providing for a more broadly-based council, the Act gives the new council additional tasks and responsibilities, some of which are extremely important, and obviously there must be enough members to undertake all this work. This includes the new task of giving advice on professional conduct and ethics, and the work of all the council's committees, including the new Health Committee, the Review Board for Overseas Qualified Practitioners and the Education Committee, with its new and wider powers. Even this list does not comprehensively describe all the functions that the new council will have, but I hope that what I have said illustrates not only the size of its task but also the range that it covers.<br><br>
Apart from the question of representativeness, the new council would need a considerably larger membership than the present council to man these committees and to undertake these tasks. A large number of people representing a wide spectrum of medical interest and knowledge is necessary if the council is to operate effectively in the best interests of both the medical profession and the public.<br><br>
On the issue of nominated membership, to which the hon. Member for Walsall, North alluded, there is the controversial matter of whether the four chief medical officers should be members of the council. That has been discussed before at length. Of course, the Government recognise that on this point we have diverged from the Merrison recommendations. This does not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
mean that we attach any less importance than Merrison did to the principle of separating the setting of standards from the provision of services. But we remain convinced it is right that the four chief medical officers should be nominated to the council because of their range of experience and the value that their advice will have for the council.<br><br>
We could not accept that the inclusion of these four doctors who, although employed in Government service are in close and constant touch with all that is going on in the profession, could possibly, among a body of 85 other doctors and six laymen, compromise the independence of the body. Although no one has suggested that this morning, it has been suggested outside the Committee. That underestimates the calibre of the other members.<br><br>
Having said this, I should make it clear that neither the Act nor the order actually specifies that the C.M.O.s will be nominated—that is a matter to which I shall come back later—and each time nominations are needed they will be made in the light of experience of the working of the council.<br><br>
The hon. Gentlemen referred to how lay membership should be chosen. There are many organisations that regard themselves, and are regarded by the Government, as having a good claim to be consulted on this. Therefore, we have the necessary flexibility to nominate the most able and experienced people to the council, and to do that the order imposes no restrictions. It is not the intention that the lay members should speak as the representatives of particular interests. That is important because, as I believe Merrison pointed out, a more general perspective is required.<br><br>
We are currently giving consideration to the best way to find such people. Ideas about that might change in time, and it would not be appropriate to narrow down our choice in the order. Flexibility will be needed in the light of experience. I am sure that a number of bodies will be thinking seriously about this now that the order is going through and will be putting forward names for consideration. The names will be put forward to Ministers, who will no doubt weigh up the circumstances and suggest that certain names are more appropriate than others. Those names will be put forward to the Privy Council, which, of course, has the final say.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the intention that such people should cover different parts of the United Kingdom, geographically, in the way recommended by Merrison, or should they come from wherever is the most suitable place, depending on the person?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of the 10 nominated members, if we have the four chief medical officers, at least one should come from each part of the United Kingdom. But I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is a strong case for saying that the six lay members should at least have some geographical spread. It would, for example, be appalling if they all came from London. I cannot, however, give any undertaking, because much will depend on who the nominated members are. I do not suggest that a person without suitable experience and qualifications would ever be put forward, but in the event of only one person being put forward in a particular region there could be a dilemma for Ministers. Because the area concerned would otherwise be completely unrepresented on the lay side, they might feel that they should appoint that person rather than someone else from a region already represented who is better qualified to take part in the work of the committee on a lay basis.<br><br>
However, there must be a balance. If there is a large number of nominations, one cannot deny that there will need to be full consideration of achieving a regional geographical coverage, in addition to the standard geographical coverage which there will be on the G.M.C. from the system of elections in various parts of the country.<br><br>
I come to the issue of overseas doctors. The hon. Member for Walsall, North and my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Dr. Miller) made the point that this was a sensitive and important issue. I take that point entirely. I shall deal first with the G.M.C. and come to the review board in a moment.<br><br>
The Overseas Doctors Association representing doctors in this country— which was one of the principal bodies to be consulted before the order was drawn up—has suggested that there should be one nomination always reserved for a doctor with overseas qualifications. This suggestion was made in response to a Government proposal that such a nomination
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
might need to be made in certain circumstances which we think are unlikely to arise.<br><br>
The contingency we had to provide for arises in this way. The Act requires that one member of the review board must always be a member of the council who has gained his medical qualifications overseas, but not in an EEC country. But there is no specific provision in the Act which secures that the total membership includes such a doctor.<br><br>
It seems reasonable to expect that there will be one or more overseas qualified doctors among the appointed or elected members. That is not an unreasonable expectation, if only because they constitute a substantial proportion of all the country's doctors. But we can only wait and see how the elections and the appointments by the appropriate education bodies turn out. If—this is the contingency—it turns out that no appropriately qualified doctor has been elected or appointed to the new G.M.C., a suitable person can be nominated in addition to the other 10 nominated members. To use a cricketing expression, it is a longstop. We hope that it will not be necessary, but if it is necessary we have the power to make use of it.<br><br>
The overseas doctor has to be an additional nominated member. Otherwise, taken with the four C.M.O.s, he would upset the requirement that the majority of the nominated members must be lay, so there has to be a six-five position on the review board. But unless this contingency arises—I hope it will not—we intend that there should be only 10 nominated members, as recommended by Merrison: the six lay members and the four C.M.O.s.<br><br>
The wish of the Overseas Doctors Association to see overseas doctors fairly represented is entirely understandable, but membership is not generally on a basis of representing specific interests, and it seems right that the O.D.A. should in the first instance look to its own approach to the elections as a way of seeing that the standpoint of overseas doctors has its voice in the new council.<br><br>
Obviously, it will be for each doctor to decide whom to vote for in elections to the new council, but we hope and expect that we shall see a fair proportion of overseas doctors standing for election and forming part of the council, so that the composition fairly reflects the make-up of the profession registered and practising in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
The provision in respect of the nominated members has been criticised for its lack of precision. Certainly, it allows a fair range of discretion, but the Act itself imposes certain constraints. Here I come back to the hon. Gentleman's point about geographical representation. There has to be one nominated member each for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In practice, given our intention of nominating the four C.M.O.s, there will normally be six lay members. In the selection of the six nominated members, the need for a reasonable geographical spread will have to be balanced with the abilities and suitability of the people put forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lewis Carter-Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Listening to my hon. Friend, I am forming the impression that the drafting of the orders has been rather slovenly. Someone ought to take a second look at it. The whole structure of the committees can be weighted one way or the other without any recompense. Can my hon. Friend please develop this argument more carefully?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So far I have been basically dealing with the constitution of the G.M.C., composed of 95 people. I shall now deal with the review board, about which a number of points have been made. I think that that is what my hon. Friend has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Minister is saying that there will be the elections and the appointments, and then the Government will make up their mind about the nominations, as a longstop. In other words, the final nominated members will be selected only once the elections and the appointments have taken place, because the Government want to use them as a balance. But does this all have to take place before 27 September? Can the Minister say something about the timing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The timing of the elections will be a matter for the G.M.C. once the order has come into effect. Perhaps I have misled the hon. Gentleman. I certainly do not want to do so.<br><br>
Nominations can go ahead from the time the order has been approved. The nominations do not have to wait for the elections. In a sense, they are separate. When I talked about a longstop, it was in respect not of the six nominated members but of the one additional member—the eleventh, nominated member.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
I should like now to turn to the order concerning the rules of the Review Board for Overseas Qualified Practitioners. Those rules are a very important matter which affect the overseas doctors who contribute so much to our health service, and it is right that we should spend some time this morning in discussing them.<br><br>
As hon. Gentlemen will realise, the provisions of the Act as they affect overseas doctors were introduced at a late stage, but were nevertheless subject to wide and detailed discussion. The Merrison report, from which they stem, was, of course, subject to even wider discussion. The provisions of the Act relating to the setting up and the functions of the review board were no less fully discussed. Although there had to be compromise, they nevertheless commanded a wide measure of agreement, not least from the overseas doctors themselves.<br><br>
As some hon. Members will know, during the early stages of formulation of the provisions of the Act, the O.D.A. suggested that one member of the review board should always be a doctor who had qualified overseas. The Government were pleased to accept that suggestion, and provision was made for it in the Act.<br><br>
To ensure that an overseas doctor will always be available, the Government have provided that, in the event of such a doctor not being elected or appointed, one will be nominated. I am pleased to say that Dr. Chatterjee, the chairman of the O.D.A., has been nominated to serve on the review board until succession day, when we shall have another look at the whole matter, because we shall have the elections at that stage.<br><br>
The question of the number of overseas qualified doctors to serve on the review board has been raised. The Act says that there should be a minimum of one, and I have explained how that will be assured. But the number of additional overseas qualified doctors who might be able to serve on the board will clearly depend upon how many are appointed or elected to the new council, bearing in mind that there will be other committees on which their presence will be desirable. It is not just the review board with which they will be concerned. Provided that sufficient are available, clearly some of the specified, elected or appointed council members appointed to serve on the review board could be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
overseas qualified, but this will obviously be a matter for the reconstituted council.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the rule about there being five members, with a quorum of three. I understand that the chairman, who is an independent chairman—that is absolutely specific in the rules—would have discretion to decide whether to operate without the overseas doctor. I make it absolutely clear that at least one overseas doctor would be invited to every meeting of the review body. Any date for such a meeting will obviously have been arranged to suit the convenience of every member. We all know the difficulties of getting busy people together. The overseas member in any event would have seen the papers, and if prevented from attending —as a result of illness, for example—could give his or her views in writing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not understand why, having set up the seven members, we then have a rule which says that "not more than five" members out of that seven shall attend for the hearings. It was certainly the intention of both sides of the Committee when we discussed the Medical Bill that the overseas qualified doctor should be present at the hearings. It is therefore a matter of concern to us that, having specified that there must be an overseas doctor in the seven and in the five, when we come to the quorum of three apparently no overseas doctor need be there. That was not the intention of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Gentleman's concern. Perhaps I may put it this way. Unless the quorum is to be the maximum number, there has to be a specified quorum. We think that a quorum of three is not inappropriate. Many other professional bodies operate on the same sort of standard of numbers.<br><br>
There has to be a minimum quorum. I do not think that it could be less than three. On the other hand, if it were more than three it might inhibit the work of the review board. One does not know how busy it will be What I want to say applies to any body, whether it be elected, appointed or anything else, where there is a quorum. We have a quorum here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0393">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All that I am saying is this. First, I want to establish that there has to be a quorum. The only difference between us—and I think it is a minor difference— is whether there ought to have been a provision that one of the quorum must always be an overseas doctor.<br><br>
In putting forward these rules after discussion, the G.M.C. felt that provided there was one overseas doctor within the five, who would always be invited to the meeting, as would the other four members, if he then failed to turn up—and I cannot imagine a circumstance other than illness in which he would not wish to turn up—it would be inappropriate for the work of the review board to be held up. When witnesses are perhaps present, or evidence is in, when people have travelled a long way to attend the hearing, it would be inappropriate for the work of the review board to be postponed merely because one particular member had not been able to be present. I should have thought that the safeguard was that he would have been able to give his views in writing in the event of illness, which I think is the only thing that would keep him away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue this, but why is there this curious arrangement of "not more than five"? Why not just provide that seven members of the board should be called, of which the quorum would be three? I take the Minister back to the original Committee proceedings on the Medical Bill, when his right hon. Friend the Minister of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are certainly determined to get an overseas doctor on the Review Board".</p></blockquote>
I shall not read it all. He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"I should have thought that in those circumstances"</p></blockquote>
of an overseas doctor not being able to be present—it would be possible to
<br><blockquote><p>"co-opt an overseas doctor on to the Review Board."</p></blockquote>
He added that there might not be definite, guaranteed powers to do this, but that he would
<br><blockquote><p>"promise to look into the matter."</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>—(<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D</i>, 14 March 1978; c.54.)</p></blockquote>
It was certainly the intention of both sides of that Committee that there should always be an overseas doctor present when the hearings were taking place. It seems to us that the Minister is now departing from that.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also find it strange that there should be this injunction about
<br><blockquote><p>"arrangements for securing that not more than five members… shall attend".</p></blockquote>
If there are seven members, I do not see why all seven should not be invited to attend. Who will select the five in the first place? How will they be selected? How does one decide which five are to be there?<br><br>
I take it that when elections take place there could be more than one overseas doctor on the committee, in which case it would be more likely that an overseas doctor would form one of the quorum. I can understand my hon. Friend's difficulty in relation to a quorum. I agree that it would be very difficult to stipulate that with such a small number as three one particular person must be there. The position would be more safeguarded, of course, if there were more than one overseas qualified doctor on the committee.<br><br>
I know of no body where there is a certain number on a committee and then a stipulation that not more than a certain number of them can attend. I cannot see why they should not all attend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This rule, rule 7, does not follow from any requirement of the Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that it should be done in this way. But I understand that the restriction in numbers —that is, the five who may adjudicate at any one time—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But there are more than five seats.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. But I understand that that restriction is a not unusual provision, and would possibly allow two panels to operate, perhaps at the same time. I do not know how many appeals there will be. With the large number of overseas doctors in the country, there might be a need for two panels. I do not know whether they would be sitting at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why five, not seven?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point has been made for me in a sense. Out of seven it would be possible to have a panel of four and a panel of three, still both within the quorum provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter-Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are getting into a very complex position. Would it not be better to have some reserves—calling
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
them, as we sometimes do in the rugby clubs, "A.N. Other"—standing by to fill the quorum?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point about co-options. I should like to consider that. We are arguing about rule 7 in particular. The rules can obviously be changed, if need be, in the light of experience. I believe that it is best to give this rule a run.<br><br>
We know that the O.D.A. is most punctilious in protecting the interests of its members, and it will have even more reason once the review board has really started its operations. If there is then any doubt as to the way in which the quorum is being operated, if there are many occasions when the quorum does not include an overseas doctor, I should have thought the association would quickly say "This is not working. It is not protecting the interests of our members."<br><br>
The fact that an overseas doctor will always be invited and that there could well be more than one overseas doctor on the review board itself suggests to me that it should not be too difficult to ensure that out of a quorum of three there should be an overseas doctor. We know how busy people are. Maybe the Committee will always operate on the basis of three or four, because there will always be someone who cannot attend at the last minute. I take the point that there is no absolute guarantee of one member being an overseas doctor. We should look at the matter in the light of experience.<br><br>
I turn to the issue of the terms of office of members. Here I come back to the General Medical Council. The hon. Member for Walsall, North made an important point about continuity. We know what it is like in Parliament with Members changing. Not every Member changes every five years, but in a democratic system a substantial turnover is possible at each election.<br><br>
The order provides for a five-year term of office. That term was unanimously accepted by all those who were consulted, even though Merrison suggested a four-year term. The five-year term was suggested in order to give members a longer period during which to use the skills and experience gained in the early years of office, It would also marginally cut down the G.M.C.'s expenses, because there would be slightly fewer elections over a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
period of years. It is also a continuation of present practice.<br><br>
The order provides for the first newly-constituted council to hold office for slightly longer than five years to allow for the initial changeover or to keep in line with the regular timetable of the G.M.C. for meetings. That brings me to the hon. Gentleman's concern. The order provides that when appointing or nominating bodies are putting forward members to fill vacancies arising part-way through the life of the council, the appointment should be for up to a maximum of five years at the discretion of the appointing or nominating body. That would allow for appointment limited to the remainder of the predecessor's term of office, which is what the Royal College of Physicians suggested, or for a full five years, as the nominating or appointing body may wish. If bodies adopt the latter course, the hon. Gentleman's point would be met, because in time it would tend to strengthen the continuity of membership between one quinquennium and the next.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to by-elections to fill casual vacancies among elected members. They will be held, at the G.M.C.'s discretion, at intervals of not more than two and a half years. To us parliamentarians, that does appear an unconscionably long time. We think that that discretion is necessary to obviate the need for an election and its consequential expense each time one seat falls vacant. Elected members taking up office mid-term would serve for the remainder of their predecessors term of office. So for elected members there will be an opportunity for change every five years, but for nominated and appointed members there is scope for a carry-over, depending on the views of the particular nominating body.<br><br>
The timing of the electoral scheme will obviously now be a matter for the new G.M.C. We know from parliamentary elections how far in advance one has to prepare for elections. Clearly, the G.M.C. will get down to consider that matter—if it is not doing so already—in the near future. If people are to be ready by the appropriate succession day in September, taking into account summer holidays and so on, it may be necessary to hold the elections in advance of that date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful for the way in which the Minister has dealt with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
the rollover, the continuity, of appointed and nominated members, and I understand what he says. It means, of course, that if there is a substantial change each five-year period appointed and nominated members will have for a period of time, because of their previous experience, considerably more knowledge and therefore more influence within the committee, as those coming in from outside will not be <i>au fait</i> with what has gone on beforehand. Was any thought given to the possibility of half-elections, every two and a half years, or whatever the period—in other words, 50 per cent, coming up for election every two and a half years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point. There was an almost unanimous feeling among the bodies consulted—not only the B.M.A. but others—that the system of having all members out at the same time was reasonable. I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's suggestion of half and half. That is what happens in the United States Congress. I do not know how it would work in parliamentary terms if half of us were to be elected at a time. I think that it would complicate matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I volunteer for the second half.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I give a little more information about the timing of elections. I understand that the electoral scheme has now been approved by the Privy Council, that notices will go out next month, and that [the elections will be concluded [by August. That should give everybody an appropriate amount of time to think about nominations.<br><br>
I do not know how much canvassing and electioneering there will be among professionals in an election, but I have no doubt that people will talk to each other and names will be put forward and so on. Whether there will be election literature, I do not know. I wish all the doctors the best of luck in this extension of democracy—of course, they are used to democracy—which will mean that more people are elected to a more powerful and more representative body. I think that that body will do a great deal of good in advancing the interests of the medical profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. M. S. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to be facetious but the wording of articles 3(5) and 4(4) of statutory instrument No. 112 concerns me. I refer to the phrases:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"When an elected member dies, resigns or otherwise ceases to be a member"</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"When an appointed or nominated member dies, resigns or otherwise ceases to be a member".</p></blockquote>
It is almost as though there is an obligation on him to die, resign, or otherwise cease to be a member. Perhaps the word "If" should have been inserted, rather than "when".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not a parliamentary draftsman, but I take my hon. Friend's point. Perhaps the more appropriate wording would have been "If and when", which would cover the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are appreciative of the Minister's having explained these points to us. It is a complicated matter, and he has put it very clearly.<br><br>
I should like to return to the subject of the chief medical officers. We debated that matter in Committee on 14 March and 16 March last year. The Opposition put down an amendment to the Medical Bill which would have precluded the nominated members being medically qualified in any way. The Minister's right hon. Friend who was dealing with the matter at the time said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is our most earnest desire to do so"—</p></blockquote>
that is, to nominate the chief medical officers. He was quite clear about that. He went on to say that in doing that
<br><blockquote><p>"We are flying in the face of a Merrison recommendation."</p></blockquote>
—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D</i>, 16 March 1978; c. 67–68.]
He did not explain why it was necessary to do that, except in the most general terms—that they would be valuable people.<br><br>
The Government are flying in the face of the Merrison recommendations in not one but two respects. One recommendation was that there should be 10 lay persons, and a great deal of emphasis was put on the fact both that they should be lay people and that there should be a considerable number of them. In fact, the Government are reducing that number from 10 to six.<br><br>
On the question of the chief medical officers a number of bodies do not agree with the Government. I have a letter from the G.M.C., which does agree. It pays full tribute to the contribution that the chief medical officers have made to the present G.M.C. That is an important point. On
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0396">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
the other hand, the B.M.A. is opposed, as is the Medical Women's Federation. I am told that a significant number of the members of the present G.M.C. are also opposed. There is some doubt about the exact number, but I know that it is significant.<br><br>
Perhaps the Government should think about the matter again. Those who oppose the idea feel very strongly about it, and I am not at all sure that it is a matter that will just go away. The Government may find that it is brought up over and over again. It may be that when the new G.M.C. is formed, with its large number of elected members, some of them will feel just the same.<br><br>
The first ground for opposition which has been given us is that if there is an argument that the chief medical officers are needed for educational purposes, the Government already have a large say in medical education.<br><br>
Secondly, the point has been made to us that the chief medical officers will have services backing them up, with departmental briefs and information, and research information, which will not be available to other members of the new G.M.C. Therefore, although their numbers may be small, their action on the new G.M.C. may be significant. They will carry a punch out of all proportion to their numbers. That was made to us as an extremely important point.<br><br>
Finally, some people are worried about the sub-committees. They see the main work of the new G.M.C. being done through its sub-committees. If the chief medical officers are to be present on all the sub-committees they will have a vital influence on the deliberations.<br><br>
It is on those three grounds that the people who feel strongly about this matter are basing their opposition. It is only right that the Government should be made aware of these views, which are not likely just to disappear in the process of time.</span></p>
<p>11.26 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have spent an hour discussing minute detail, when clearly the sole purpose is to control entry of overseas doctors, which is a polite euphenism for Asians and West Indians. We are hiding behind that phrase.<br><br>
I cannot let this opportunity pass without endorsing what my learned Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Minister said briefly, but which no one else has said, possibly because we have been immersed in detail. I pay tribute to the vast number of overseas doctors— Asians, West Indians, and so on—who are working in our hospitals. I share with the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) the distinction of representing Walsall. Without Asian and West Indian doctors the health service in that town would collapse.
Doctors do not rush to urban areas, but, thankfully, those from overseas do. There are, I understand, over 20,000. We should not allow ourselves, through being immersed in detail, to forget the fact that we owe an enormous debt to these doctors. I trust that they do not feel threatened by any legislation we pass or by any regulations brought forward as a result of that legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note the points that the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan) made with great interest and concern. They are not unknown to us, and certainly we shall seriously consider them.<br><br>
The idea that four C.M.O.s—however distinguished, experienced and with whatever title and medical degrees they may have—will have a disproportionate influence in a new G.M.C. of 95 members is probably going too far. I should have thought that the newly elected members in particular will be raring to go. They will know that they are part of a much larger and powerful organisation—I will not say a more prestigious organisation, although in time it will no doubt become even more prestigious than the present G.M.C. The idea that perhaps the majority of present G.M.C. members are opposed on the question of the C.M.O.s sits rather oddly with the letter which the hon. Gentleman received from the G.M.C.<br><br>
Once the C.M.O.s are on the council as nominated members, their future is in the hands of the council, in the sense that it will be up to the council to decide what role they play, and so on. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that they will have considerable experience and expertise and all the resources of a Department behind them. But the new G.M.C. will not allow its newly elected members, for example, to have no services. It would be failing in its duty if it allowed that to happen, and I am sure that that is not its intention.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0397">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
The back-up services, particularly for the important committees on health and education, the review board, and so on, will be extremely important. We have talked about elections, nominations and so on, but not about the secretariat of the G.M.C. I am sure that we can rely on a new, reconstituted more powerful and prestigious G.M.C. to ensure not only that the interests of the doctors it represents are protected but, much more important, that sufficient scope and back-up is given to the new members who will be appointed, nominated and, above all, elected to the new body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that four members out of 98 was a small number. But in Committee last year the Minister of State said, speaking of the role of a chief medical officer:
<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed, the former chief medical officer for Scotland, Sir John Brotherston, played a distinguished role on the General Medical Council by chairing the Education Committee."</p></blockquote>
—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D</i>, 16 March 1978; c. 68.]
If the C.M.O.s are to get these commanding heights, it is not just a question of four out of 98. As the Minister has already rightly pointed out, the education committee has a critical role. Those who have been in contact with my hon. Friend are concerned that because the C.M.O.s have the time—maybe—the resources, the backup and the research, they will be able to get themselves into a very strong position and take over the commanding heights. The chairmanship of the education committee would, I think, be a classic example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Deakins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's doubts, but I hope that they will not be justified. Indeed, I do not think that they will. But so much will depend— I do not mean this in any unkind sense— on the character and determination of the new people who are elected and appointed, because they will be in a vast majority over

the lay members and the four C.M.O.s on the new G.M.C. Once they get the bit between their teeth, I think that they will make sure that they run the G.M.C. as they want it to be run.<br><br>
Chief medical officers may say" Things ought to be done in this way, because they have always been done in that way in the Department "or" The old G.M.C. used to operate in such a way". I have no doubt that there will be some people on the reconstituted G.M.C. who served on the present G.M.C. But, if the new members resemble the typical new, younger Members of Parliament who appear in the House of Commons with each successive general election, I think that they will be prepared to stand up for themselves and their rights and say "This is how we want to do things".<br><br>
The new Members may well decide that the chairman of a committee should always be an elected member. They are entirely at liberty to make such a decision, and I would think that that would be a perfectly right and proper thing to do. The idea that C.M.O.s automatically—by virtue of their prestigious position and experience—will get these plum jobs, if that is what they are, is unlikely to be proved true in the event, when the new body has been formed.</span></p>
