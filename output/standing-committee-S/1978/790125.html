	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if, with this, we take the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Sea Fishing (Specified Foreign Boats) Licensing (No. 3) Order 1977 (Variation) Order 1978 (S.I. No. 1652).</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister certain specific questions on these orders. I think that he will agree that all forms of orders or statutory instruments that we get in this House are generally unintelligible to the layman outside, and are often unintelligible to Members of Parliament as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first order—the Faroe Islands No. 3 order—as I understand it, increases the area of fishing for Norway pout and sprat for Faroese vessels. The second order seems to me to be much the same as the Faroe Islands No. 4 order. This allows the Faroese vessels to fish in certain British waters. Therefore, both these orders extend the amount of fishing that Faroese vessels can do in British waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated this formal order, because it occurs fairly regularly, in the past. I have made the point before that we always seem to be giving the Faroese an extension of the waters in which they can fish but what do we get in return? The Minister will remember that in the past there has been a diminution of the amount of Faroese waters in which British vessels can fish. I do not know whether he would wish to do so now, but perhaps he could make clear whether these orders which confer increases" on the Faroese have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<i>quid pro quo.</i> In other words, do we get more access to Faroese waters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move to the third order—Specified Countries (No. 3). This, I understand, varies the 1977 order for vessels from Spain and Sweden. What I am not clear about from the order, not having an atlas and the various regions delegated in the order immediately at hand, is whether it gives the Swedesh and Spanish vessels more rights to fish in British waters or less? I should imagine it would be more. Why does it apply only to Spain and Sweden who have, as I understand it, no historic fishing rights off our coasts and are not members of
the EEC? Again, is there a 	<i>quid pro quo here?</i>
I come finally to the Specified Foreign Boats Licensing (No. 3) order. This brings boats of Sweden and the Faroes—both of which were referred to in the previous orders—within the ambit of the 1977 order. This order states that the licences granted by the EEC allows fishing for these boats within British waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may take all these orders together. They increase the amount of fishing which can be done within the British 200-mile EEZ by Faroese, Swedish or Spanish vessels. May I ask the Minister under whose authority is this fishing actually carried out? The last order specifies EEC licensing. The three other orders do not mention the EEC. I assume that the first three orders come under British legislation. Does the EEC agree, or is this one of the conservation measures introduced by the Government, with the support of the Opposition, achieve better conservation within the British 200-mile EEZ? Is it or is it not agreed by the EEC, or is it one of these orders which we introduced unilaterally? In that case, what is happening to the foreign vessels? Are they obeying the order? What is the position of our own fishery protection vessel? are they effecting arrest and are they entitled to do so under international law?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will appreciate that the situation is muddled because some of the legislation is enforced through the EEC, and I for one do not understand where the dividing line is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the legislation we have passed and discussed in this Committee in the past 18 months is drawn up under EEC rules and some concerns purely British conservation measures. I think this vagueness and the repetition of these orders,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
which have been in operation for 18 months, underline the very unsatisfactory position of the fishing industry today. We are told that in three months' time the Ministers responsible for fishing matters will be meeting in Brussels, or wherever, that there will be a settlement, we shall have a definite statement about the common fisheries policy and we shall know where we stand. Inevitably, after three months we find ourselves back in this Committee with a fresh batch of orders but with no solution to the problem. The Ministers have met, have agreed to disagree and have gone away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Minister that there must be compromise sometime. Time is not on our side because by 1982, according to the EEC rules, the limit is the shoreline of all the EEC countries. How long are we to wait? I know that the Minister cannot give me a definite answer because it depends on the Secretary of State's colleagues in the EEC. But he will appreciate that we have been waiting a long time and it is beginning to seem to us that the Government are now waiting for the general election so that they can pass the baby on to the next Government. I remind the Minister that this is a very important matter for the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer the Committee to an article in the	<i> Hull Daily Mail</i> of 23rd January. It says
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the first time on record more than half the 1,200 fishermen registered in the Hull area are out fo work."</p></blockquote>
Over 600 men in Hull alone—fishermen, not people in ancillary industries—are out of work. That is the catastrophic effect on the distant water industry. Until we have an agreement with the EEC we shall not get the swap deals which we need so badly with Iceland, Norway, the Soviet Union and others so that at least some of our vessels can return to the waters they have fished for centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that we are living on borrowed time. The year 1982 is not so far away and there must be a compromise at some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inshore industry is also suffering. I draw the Committee's attention to 	<i>Fish Trader</i> of Saturday 13 January reporting a big debate with Mr. Howell, the Chief Fisheries Officer for Sussex, who complained that the quota system just does not work. He alleged that the Belgians have completed the whole of their year's quota by March in each of the past three years. The Ministry was brought in, agreed to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
figures and did nothing. Maybe it can do nothing in these circumstances, but I think it is a matter the Minister should refer to in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, because of the difficulties with the EEC the situation for the distant water industry is extremely serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be serious for the inshore men in future, and there must be some compromise settlement as soon as possible. I hope that the Minister will be able to throw some light on the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that 600 fishermen are out of work in Hull has nothing to do with the economic emergency—nothing to do with the lorry drivers' strike—tout, of course, it makes the situation worse. I have handed to the Minister a telegram which I received today from the fishing industry in Hull and Grimsby saying how serious the situation is. The fish stocks—fish meal, fish oil—are being picketed and the men are not being allowed to move them without signing an agreement with the union, which I suggest is pure blackmail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.40 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I rise at this stage to outline the background of the orders so that hon. Members will know a little more not only about the orders, but about the context in which they have to be considered. It is in that respect that the hon. Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) has already raised some queries. I may deal with some of his queries during my speech and if not perhaps I shall take the opportunity later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the hon. Member for Haltemprice to know that I have taken note of the telegram to which he has made reference and our officials will look into the matter to see what action can be taken to deal with the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opening comment of the hon. Gentleman suggested that the Government were waiting for the General Election to pass the baby. I can assure him, and others, that we anticipate continuity of policy in this matter under the present and the next Administration, with the continued support of all parties and of the industry, which we have enjoyed to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that brief reference to the party situation perhaps we can return to our normal recognition that all parties are united in the matter of getting the best deal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
for our fishermen in relation to the needs of the Community as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four orders before the Committee make changes in the rules governing third country fishing within British fishery limits. I think it would be helpful if I were to put those changes in context by outlining the development of our fisheries relations with the third countries concerned over the past year or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Early last year, as hon. Members will know, the EEC Commission negotiated fishing agreements for 1978, based on reciprocity, with Norway, the Faroe Islands and Sweden. Formally the Council still had to approve the agreements. Our fishermen have traditionally fished substantial quantities in Faroese waters, and indeed in Norwegian waters-—both in the Arctic and in the North Sea. We therefore said that our attitude in Council would depend on our obtaining a satisfactory share of Community quotas in Norwegian and Faroese waters. The hon. Gentleman has already asked questions about how the deal is going—whether to our advantage or disadvantage. I may deal with that point in more detail later. In the case of Sweden, in whose waters United Kingdom fishermen have not traditionally fished, we said that we were prepared to agree the limited quotas offered to the Swedes in the North Sea—which obviously affect the quantities available to United Kingdom fishermen— but again we could do so only on condition that the Norwegian and Faroese agreements were dealt with to our satisfaction. In the event the Council did not formally approve the third country agreements until July, although reciprocal fishing carried on up to then under provisional arrangements which were also incorporated into United Kingdom legislation. As part of the Council agreement the United Kingdom obtained, 	<i>inter alia,</i> 70 per cent, of the Community's cod and haddock quota at northern Norway and 40 per cent, of the redfish; and in Faroese waters the entire Community quota for directed cod and haddock fishing and 30 per cent, of the saithe. We would naturally like to have secured even higher proportions but I am sure that we obtained the best deal possible at the time. Hon. Members may also recall that, as part of the package, the Council agreed that the quotas of herring West of Scotland, which had previously been offered to Norway and the Faroes, should be withdrawn. This was in recogni-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
tion of the fact that the United Kingdom had banned further fishing of that stock in 1978 in accordance with the advice of ICES.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the reasoning behind the orders before us today. In August the Faroese asked to be allowed to fish part of their quotas of pout and sprat in area VI, West of Scotland. They argued that they were unable to take their full quota of Norway pout in the North Sea, partly because of the effects of conservation measures. They also argued that the omission of area VI from the 1978 agreement had been a mistake on the part of their negotiators because they had fished in this area for several years previously. Their request was agreed within the Community, subject to a limit on the amount of pout to be taken West of Scotland, and the change is incorporated in the Fishing Boats (Faroe Islands) Designation (No. 3) (Variation) Order 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may summarise what that order says. It amends the principal Fishing Boats (Faroe Islands) Designation Order enabling the Faroese to fish for Norway pout and sprat in area VIA—that is to the west of Scotland—as well as in area IV in the North Sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Sea Fishing (Specified Foreign Boats) Licensing (No. 3) Order 1977 (Variation) Order 1978 was to require Swedish and Faroese vessels fishing in our waters to obtain licences from the EEC Commission. Provision for the introduction of licensing was contained in the 1978 agreements, but it was not possible to complete the technical preparations before October. Licensing was therefore introduced from 1 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We very much welcomed this move, which meant that we could exercise closer control over the activities of Swedish and Faroese vessels in our waters. The introduction of licensing also balanced the fact that member States' vessels are required to carry licences to fish in Swedish and Faroese waters. We agreed, however, that Norwegian vessels should not be licensed— except at Greenland—because our own vessels do not need a licence to fish in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Nevertheless Norwegian vessels are required to report their position and catches by radio in the same way as vessels of other third countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise, the effect of the order is therefore to prohibit fishing within British fishery limits by Swedish and Faroese
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
vessels, except under the authority of a licence. This brings the arrangements for Swedish and Faroese vessels into line with those for Spanish vessels, which for some time have been required to carry a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pass on to the next order, the Fishing Boats (Specified Countries) Designation (No. 3) Order 1977 (Variation) (No. 2) Order 1978. I shall briefly explain what that mouthful means. Its effect is to amend the principal designation order in respect of Spain and Sweden. It enables the Spaniards to fish for sardine in area VIII, only a small part of which falls within British fishery limits, and enables them to fish for tuna, or tunny, in areas VI and VII as well as in area VIII. At the same time, Spanish fishermen are excluded from fishing in the Irish Sea, part of the Bristol Channel, and British waters west of Scotland and the area south of 56°30' North. The other change made by the order is to prevent Swedish vesssel which have quotas of ling and blue whiting West of Scotland from fishing in waters south of 56°30' North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the order means, but perhaps I may fill in the background against which it has been tabled. The main changes made by the order are in respect of Spanish fishing. For most of the last year, the Council of Ministers authorised Spanish vessels to fish in member States' waters only for short periods at a time. The intention was to put pressure on Spain to negotiate a framework fisheries agreement with the Community. Negotiations for such an agreement—which provides for a gradual reduction in Spanish fishing to the low level justified by reciprocity— were completed early in September last year. It will come as no surprise to hon. Members that the United Kingdom is blocking signature of the agreement, as of other framework agreements, in accordance with out demand for progress to be made simultaneously on all parts of the common fisheries policy, including those parts of most concern to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did, however, agree at last September's Council to a small increase in Spain's hake quota for the last quarter of 1978 in recognition of the fact that negotiations had effectively been concluded. It was also agreed that Spanish vessels could fish for sardine in area VIII, which is mainly French waters, and for tuna. In addition, certain restrictions were imposed on the areas in which Spanish fishing for hake could take place. These changes in respect
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
of species and areas were incorporated in the two Orders before the Committee which relate to Spain, dealing with designation and licensing respectively. I might also mention that the opportunity was taken to make a small change in the areas in which Swedish vessels were permitted to fish for blue whiting and ling. The change confines Swedish fishing in area VI to waters North of 56°30'North, the area where Swedish vessels have fished in the past. This is again in accordance with the 1978 agreement between Sweden and the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that hon. Members have on occasion expressed dissatisfaction with the number and frequency of amending orders which we have had to lay in respect of third country fishing. This has, of course, resulted partly from the uncertainty within the Community caused by the lack of an agreed common fisheries policy. That point has been made many times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make a suggestion? As I understand it, these four orders are virtually package deals agreed with the EEC. Would it be possible in future, in an explanatory note, to say whether the order is an EEC order or is agreed by the EEC? It does on the last order, but not on the others. It would be helpful to the Committee if that were done in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The orders all reflect EEC arrangements with the countries concerned. The agreements with Norway and the Faroes are reciprocal, and the United Kingdom benefits directly. The agreement with Sweden is reciprocal and mainly benefits the Danes and Germans, who fish in Swedish waters. The agreement with Spain is non-reciprocal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This situation has resulted partly from the uncertainty in the Community caused by the lack of an agreed common fisheries policy. The Commission is at present engaged in negotiating quota agreements for 1979 with the Faroes, Spain and Sweden and has already reached agreement with Norway. I hope that arrangements can be finalised earlier this year than they were in 1978. It would then be our intention to produce consolidated orders incorporating any necessary changes to existing provisions. Meanwhile the Council
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
has agreed interim arrangements permitting reciprocal fishing to continue for the first two months of 1979. The Fishing Boats (Faroe Islands) Designation (No. 4) Order extends the period in which Faroese vessels may fish in our waters to 28 February. The designation orders relating to Norway, Sweden and Spain are not subject to a specific time limit and therefore do not require extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will approve the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for explaining these orders and for dealing with the detailed problems. The Minister gets lost reading his brief which shows how much more difficult it is for we Back Benchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These orders are very complicated. The detail is difficult to understand, and we rely largely on the Minister's explanation. To that extent, we are very grateful for the trouble he has taken over the details. To a degree, we have to take what he says on trust, because of the complication of the matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one general comment to make on a remark by my hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall). This is the first debate on fishing since the House reassembled following the Christmas and New Year recess. Many of us are probably wondering what precisely is happening about the renegotiation of the CFP, as it is largely in that context that these individual orders are viewed. We accept the Government's word that they are acceptable in the short term, but we need to view them all in a longer-term context. The Minister did not say very much about that. Perhaps he will try later to set this order in the broader context, so that we may understand the background against which we are debating these orders. This would help us to understand them and to explain them to fishermen and others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the Minister will not follow the hon. Gentleman's advice; it would not be in order to go into the background. The hon. Member might like to bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, it is quite important, because all these orders are within a long-term context, Mr. Spence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not suggesting that it is not important, but this is neither the time nor the place to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your ruling, Mr. Spence, but I think that there is a certain relevance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly sure that there is a certain relevance, but not in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Spence, I feel that it is relevant to this Committee. However, I shall not press the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to consider the reciprocal effect of these orders. It is as a consequence of such orders that we see the concessions or regulations which operate for Faroese, Swedish and Spanish vessels in our waters. We all know that there is the reverse of this in relation to the access that our vessels have to the waters of other countries. I suggest that the reciprocal effect is an integral part of the order. All these arrangements are negotiated—in the short term, before we see the full renegotiation of the CFP—on a reciprocal basis. It is on this reciprocal basis that our fishermen view these orders as much as for the immediate and direct effects on fishing efforts in our waters. This is the view of the middle and distant water fleet from Aberdeen. The Scottish section of that fleet is the one with the greatest interest in what is happening in the Faroe Islands—it has a very real and direct interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has to be appreciated, that, because of the reciprocal nature, one of the effects of these orders is greatly to restrict the opportunities of our vessels fishing in the waters of other countries. I have just seen some figures, which have been supplied by the Aberdeen Fishing Vessel Owners Association to the Government. I am glad that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is here this morning. I hope he is considering these figures urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that landings by trawlers at Aberdeen from middle and distant waters fell from 425,466 cwt. in 1974 to 60,419 cwt. in 1978. In other words, a consequence of these reciprocal arrangements has been that over a five-year period the landings by the Aberdeen fleet from Faroese waters last year were 14.2 per
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
cent, of what they were in 1974. It is in that context that we have to view this order. It is important to realise what this means for our fleets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot lose fishing grounds of that nature. I am dealing only with the Faroese losses here, because they are affected by this order, but the same could apply to other fishing grounds, where there are losses to a similar or greater extent. However, I wish to dwell on the Faroese position which for Aberdeen presents the most dramatic figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Minister of State knows, as does the Under-Secretary, that this means that in the most recent half-year the Aberdeen fleet of boats of 80 ft. and more ended up with a fleet operating loss of £675,000. That figure is for the half year. It excludes depreciation and loan and interest charges. It is a straight operating loss. In such circumstances, for how long we shall see our fleet operating in that way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all I want to say this morning. I could extend my argument further and discuss the question of Government subsidies and so on, but I appreciate that such matters do not come within these orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering the consequences of these orders. I have shown what the consequences are for the Aberdeen fleet. The Government have introduced certain measures for other fishing ports. They have not introduced those measures for Aberdeen. I hope that this debate will at least give us a few minutes during which we may concentrate our minds on the consequences for the Aberdeen fleet, and the Government may concentrate their minds on the problem in Aberdeen and consider what kind of help may be given in the short term until we obtain the longer-term solution to which I referred earlier, but to which I shall not again refer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) I sympathise with the Minister in trying to wade through these orders and make some sense out of them; but it is even more difficult for the rest of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One hon. Member on a similar Committee once suggested that it would be a very good thing if, with each of these orders, the Government provided a little map showing where exactly these places are, and perhaps including a little code for the type of fish, so that we could see what
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
we were doing. Other hon. Members of the Committee have referred to the difficulty we face. We come to this Committee from time to time to discuss various orders of this kind, and it is difficult to recollect all the orders which have gone before and to appreciate to what extent the orders we are now considering affect what we have already done. In the course of his remarks, the Minister mentioned the question of the elimination of the entitlement of the Faroese to take herring off the West coast of Scotland. I think that I am correct in saying that. I do not see the Minister bounding up to confirm it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This leads me to the point that, just as the Aberdeen fleet has been affected by the Faroese fishing, there are consequences also for the fleet in my constituency at Fraserburgh and Peterhead, particularly in relation to herring. As the Minister will know, at Fraserburgh and Peterhead, about 16 boats are now tied up. When there is a restriction in one area, fishermen, naturally enough, look elsewhere for opportunities. But the opportunities for sprats, for example, have been pretty bad since the beginning of the year. The opportunities for mackerel in the South-West of England are unfavourable to paired trawlers. What those fishermen would like to know is what the Government intend to do, now that all these restrictions are coming in. Will the Government give them an opportunity to find alternative outlets for their capacity? As the Under-Secretary will know very well, members of the Scottish Pelargic Fishing Association—the modern name by which the old Scottish herring producers are known—have been to the Scottish Office and have asked for some form of what they call the survival quota of herring off the West Coast, particularly at the Minch. They have had what they regard as a fair hearing at the Scottish Office—I think that is a reasonable way of putting it—but so far there has been no action. L wonder whether the Minister could give us today some indication of what may happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a question which I should like to put to the Minister in general terms. Does he consider that this is a good deal, from our point of view? The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns touched on the fact that many fishermen feel that, somehow or other, other countries do better out of some of these deals than our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
fishermen. While the Minister gave us some interesting figures—which I am afraid he rushed through—on the effects of that, I do not think that he gave us any comparison with the catch in previous years. It would be useful if he could give us a brief summary of the total quantity and value involved on the one side, and the reciprocal volume and value on the other. His advisers are no doubt bringing out their pocket calculators at the moment to get that information ready. It would be useful, in any future debates on orders of this kind, to give some quantification in volume and value on both sides. This is very useful and valuable, not just for members of the Committee, but for those outside when they read our proceedings. That would put these Orders in the particular context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that the scarcity of fish resulting from these and other restrictions is hitting not just the fishing boats, but the fishing factories. Does the Minister think that these orders will make available any more fish for the processing factories? As he knows, in the North-East of Scotland in particular, where most of the Scottish fish processing is concentrated, we are having a very difficult time with redundancies in firms using temporary employment subsidy. There is great disappointment that the Government, after months and months of consideration, have failed to come up with a scheme for the industry which will protect the jobs of people in the factories, at least until we know the shape of future fishing under a re-negotiated common fisheries policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave the Minister notice that I might raise this matter, and I hope that he realises the gravity of the situation. There are several thousand people involved, with very little alternative employment for them in these areas. They feel greatly disillusioned. Everyone on the shop floor feels greatly disillusioned with the way in which the Government have failed, after many months' discussions, to come forward with a scheme which is comprehensible to the industry as a whole. The Government seem to be saying that it is left to individual companies to apply for specific assistance. That will just lead to a free-for-all and the small companies will find it more difficult than the larger companies to frame requests and to obtain assistance of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be extremely valuable if the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Minister could say whether we are likely to get more fish for our processing factories as a result of these orders. If he could say how much we are likely to get in the course of this year, that would be even more valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, Mr. Spence, that I have kept within the rules on these orders, which you have interpreted in a very generous way. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.7 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the pleasure yesterday of debating forestry with the right hon. Gentleman. I could not help thinking that it was very odd with the figures that emerged in that Committee that Britain had the smallest interest in forestry of all countries in the EEC, and that therefore it was outside the scope of the Treaty of Rome and the EEC regulations. But when we come to fish, where we have the biggest percentage of all the EEC countries, we find that we are regulated by the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the right hon. Gentleman's explanation. I note what he said—and I think we are all happy that we now have licensing and know exactly what people are allowed to do and what boats should arrive. But I am still not quite certain how we stand with Norway. I think the right hon. Gentleman said that we do not need licences between ourselves and Norway. As I understand it, our fishing boats which go into Norwegian waters must report their catch. That does not seem to be a reciprocal arrangement. Surely this is all bound up with the arrangements we make for all fishing in the North Sea—in all British waters. There is a report in 	<i>Fishing News</i> of 19 January about new quotas being agreed between the EEC and Norway. Will these lead to orders being laid in the future showing what part of the catch in Norwegian waters we shall get? I should be grateful if the Minister could comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wonder whether the Minister could tell us what orders which have been passed in the past few months are in dispute with the EEC and which have been referred to the European Court of Justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a feeling that the Norway pout box is the only order that we have passed in this House which is accepted by the EEC and is not in dispute. It is worrying that we should happily attend Committees at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
monthly intervals to pass orders, not knowing whether the orders that we pass are acceptable to the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask one more parochial question. I have always felt that the fishing boats, many of which are based in my constituency which fish line in Faroese waters, ought to be given extra privileges because they are line fishing boats. They are better conservation fishers. The men think they should have extra privileges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said that there were consolidating orders to follow. I find it odd that three of the orders have no termination date, and yet the last of the Faroese orders which was laid only on 4 January, expires on 28 February. The previous order was laid without an expiry date. There may be a perfectly good reason for the fact that one has an expiry date and the other three do not. In many ways, it would be a good thing if we could try to arrange for them all to expire at a certain date so that we would know what we had to renew. I do not know whether that is practicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have said earlier that I am sure the whole Committee welcomes the presence here of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who, although not officially a member of the Committee, has shown his continuing interest in Scottish fishermen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) referred to points on the Faroes No. 3 and No. 4 orders. I have already referred to those orders. The No. 3 order allows the Faroese to fish off the West of Scotland as well as in the North Sea, but gives them no additional fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The No. 4 order merely extends the duration of the reciprocal arrangements until the end of February. The Faroese are likewise allowing fishing in Faroese waters by Community vessels, including the United Kingdom, on a temporary basis until an agreement for 1979 is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the question raised by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) about progress in negotiations of the CFP, we can understand the feelings of the industry on the lack of progress. It can only be made when all sides show flexibility in negotiations, as the United Kingdom has done. Our industry accepts this and it has told us that it is willing to wait for a fair settlement rather than settle for a bad compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Perhaps I may add that the next fisheries council is planned for 12–13 February. The United Kingdom has discussed with the Commission and the new French presidency ways of resolving the outstanding difficulties identified at the last meeting of the Fisheries Council in November. We are confident that the new presidency is very much aware of this problem. Ministers and officials are in close touch with the industry and continue to be fully aware of the industry's views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the effect of United Kingdom access on third countries—of course all these orders are dealing with situations leading up to what we hope will be an early settlement this year of the outstanding issues—any access limitation accepted by our EEC partners in preference areas will probably have implications for the access of third country vessels. It is impossible for us to state what the precise effect will be until the Community reaches agreement on the internal regime. And then, of course, any change of arrangements for fishing by third countries will be a matter for discussion between the Community and the countries concerned. In my opening comments I made reference to the fact that all the orders reflect EEC arrangements with the countries concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the general question raised by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns about United Kingdom fishing in third country waters and the reduction in catches at the Faroes, The situation there is that the level of catches made by United Kingdom vessels at the Faroes in 1978 was by far the lowest in recent years. Catches of cod, haddock and saithe have fallen well below the quotas we obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fishing industry explained this shortfall as being attributable to the minimum mesh sizes in Faroese waters being 135 mm, limitations in the areas in which they are permitted to fish and, finally, unduly harsh and inconsistent enforcement practices. We shall be taking these matters up in the negotiations and the Faroese have already accepted that there have been problems with some of their enforcement measures and they are considering proposals for improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the pout and sprat fishery west of Scotland, the Faroese have fished pout and sprat in this area for some years, and this is why we agreed to let them do so in 1978. There was no question of giving them extra fish above what was specified in the 1978 agreement. It was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
simply a case of transferring part of the quotas from the North Sea. In agreeing to this the United Kingdom insisted on the limitation of the quantity of pout which could be taken west of Scotland to 6,000 tonnes. On the limited evidence so far available in this area there is not the same problem of by-catches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also think that it is fair to say that, not only has a lot of fishing in the Faroes been reduced, but Faroese fishing in our waters has been similarly affected. This reflects the desire of fishermen on both sides to catch more in their own waters and to see third country fishing reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) raised a question of derogation for herring fishermen. The Government are aware of the hardship that the bans on herring fishing in the North Sea and to the west of Scotland can cause for catchers and processors. It is encouraging that many fishermen have succeeded in adapting to fishing for other species. This is happening all the time and has helped to alleviate the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course it is in the interest of the industry as a whole that the herring stocks should be allowed to recover as quickly as possible and nothing less than a total ban will help us to achieve this aim. Even if derogations could be justified on scientific grounds, which at present they cannot, they could not be restricted to United Kingdom fishermen, but would have to be open to all the EEC fishermen on the grounds of discrimination. This would do further damage to the prospects of recovery of the stocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the 1979 reciprocal quota agreement—I think that this point was queried by the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns—the Commission has negotiated a quota agreement for 1979 with Norway. Negotiations are still taking place with the Faroes and Sweden and the Commission is likely to submit the result of all three negotiations to the Council at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member will anticipate, the United Kingdom attitude depends upon the share of Community quotas in Norwegian and Faroese waters which we are able to obtain. The reciprocal fishing arrangement with the Faroes, Sweden and Norway are continuing under the provisional agreements made to the end of February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
With regard to two earlier points raised by the hon. Member for Haltemprice regarding Spain and Sweden, the United Kingdom is looking to secure & reduction in Spanish quotas in member States' waters well below the level granted to them in the last quarter of 1978. This would be consistent with the objective of progressively establishing a reciprocal balance— this phrase comes up all the time, and rightly so—as there is little Community fishing in the Spanish zone. Consultations, are not, however, far advanced, and the 1978 arrangements have been brought forward for the first part of 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) asked about the licensing of Norwegian vessels. United Kingdom and other EEC vessels are licensed at north Norway, and Norwegian vessels are licensed at Greenland. Neither United Kingdom nor Norwegian vessels are licensed in the North Sea, but both sides have to report their movements and catches by radio. I believe that I made that point in my opening remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new 1979 agreement with Norway may mean changes in the designation order. We hope to wrap this up in a consolidation order, and this will be done after the Council has agreed arrangements for all third countries in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) asked about the possibility of small survival quotas of herring for the United Kingdom and specifically the Scottish fishermen. Of course we sympathise with the situation of the herring fishermen. We are being pressed by fishermen in various parts of the United Kingdom for derogations from the herring bans, but we must resist them unless we are convinced that a derogation is essential for the survival of small fishermen and is of a size that would not harm the stock. Derogations can therefore be only very exceptional. The objective is to conserve the stock, and it is good that fishermen generally have accepted the situation for the time being, in the hope of better stocks later on and a better future for the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East referred to the local situation. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland gave a reply on 17 January, when the hon. Member asked him for a statement on the most recent meeting which the Herring Buyers' Association had had with his Department. I understand the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
concern that the hon. Member and his local industry have about the matter, but I must refer to my hon. Friend's answer to the effect that, at a meeting with officials on 12 January, representatives of the Herring Buyers' Association were told that the Government were prepared to consider requests from individual companies for assistance under section 7 of the Industry Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was told at the same time that the association, while clearly preferring some special sectoral scheme which would benefit the industry as a whole, undertook to consider the proposal in consultation with its membership, and to report back in due course. To help the association in its consideration, my hon. Friend's officials will be writing to it and to the trade unions involved explaining in detail the assistance which could be made available. We hope that the association will examine the offer carefully, as it could afford prompt and substantial help to the companies that are in serious difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since that reply was given by my hon. Friend, some interest in section 7 assistance has been shown by individual firms in the industry. I am sure that my hon. Friend will keep in touch with the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East on this matter, which is of some importance to the local situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, East asked about preference for line fishermen. I may say that line fishermen in the Faroes are not subject to the same restrictions as apply to our trawlers, and indeed they have access to some of the best grounds on the Faroe Bank where neither Faroese nor Community trawlers are permitted to fish. This reflects the contribution to the conservation of fish stocks of line fishing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has indicated that there is considerable co-operation with the EEC, presumably to our mutual benefit. On the broader question of the fisheries policy, may I ask him when the next meeting of the fisheries Ministers of the EEC will take place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I said "13 February".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked how many of the orders we passed are in dispute with the EEC and will be referred by the EEC to the European court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to the comment I made to the hon. Member for Haltem-price (Mr. Wall) earlier, when I said that all the orders reflect EEC arrangements with the various countries concerned. The arrangements with Norway and the Faroes are reciprocal and the United Kingdom benefits directly. The agreement with Sweden is reciprocal and mainly benefits the Danes and Germans who fish in Swedish waters. The agreement with Spain is non-reciprocal and the Spaniards are being phased out of member States' waters. But we have said that we shall consider unilateral action where we feel it is necessary to help conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point about all these orders and about conservation generally is that if all these resources which we contribute so magnificently to the Community stock are not protected, it is not in the interests of the Community and not in our interest either. We have a sense of stewardship and accountability for these resources so that we can ensure that there is fish for all fishermen in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the specific question about orders being in dispute with the Community, I must say that is not the case with any of the orders before us today. Three United Kingdom unilateral orders on conservation are in dispute. We try to reach agreement on these matters but I believe that we are right in standing firm on conservation because we are looking after stock which means the future, not only of our industry, but of those in the Community and elsewhere who wish to fish within our waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those comments, I hope that the Committee will agree to the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
