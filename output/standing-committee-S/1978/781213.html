	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Joyce Butler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Cosmetic Products Regulations 1978 (S.I. No. 1354).</p></blockquote>
Although I had expected that my Adjournment debate in the House last August would be my last opportunity to comment on the proposed Cosmetic Products Regulations 1978, I am grateful for this further opportunity to discuss them although they have now become operative and cannot be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I appreciate the point made by the Toilet Preparations Federation in the letter which it sent to all members of this Committee, that the regulations are a significant step forward in legislation on cosmetic safety, no one, surely, can be happy that a directive on which work started in 1969, nearly 10 years ago, has to be implemented lock, stock and barrel by this country in 1978 without any significant change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister, told me in the debate in the House on 3rd August that he had sent copies of the first draft of the regulations to 270 organisations, including a number of medical bodies. I have spoken to representatives of some of those bodies and they all inform me that, because of the short time allowed for comment, they were not able to examine the proposals in depth. They may have felt constrained by the original deadline at the end of January this year. Had they realised that the time could be extended, as it has been by eight months, they might well have made representations on a number of points. This difficulty was experienced by both the Medical Research Council and the carcinogens committee of the Department of Health and Social Security, two particularly important bodies. That was the information given to me, and I hope that my hon. Friend will correct me if I am wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Not only do we have to accept the regulations made in Europe as they are but we also lack the benefit of the results of consideration in depth by at least some of our own experts. This point is relevant to three substances to which I shall refer in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important body which was not included in the consultations is the dermatology sub-committee of the British Medical Association, which shares my enthusiasm for ingredient labelling and my preference for the American type of regulations which provide for it. As dermatologists, they point out that it is essential to know all the constituents of a product in order to carry out effective allergy tests. I understand that during the course of discussions in Brussels, prior to the adoption of the directive, full ingredient labelling, as in the United States, was favoured by consumer groups who saw it as a way of informing the purchaser of the nature of the product and assisting in the choice of value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is regrettable that the consumer voice was too small in Brussels to counter the influence of the cosmetics industry. It would have been valuable to have ingredient labelling for its own sake and also because it would have provided one system for the whole American and European cosmetic trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the point I raised on the Floor of the House and in Questions, namely, the medical concern about two hair dyes which do not appear in the list of prohibited substances in the regulations. These are 2,4 diaminoanisole and 2,4 diaminotoluene. Presumably, they were not prohibited in the original directive because research into their carcinogenicity was at an early stage at that time, but they are now widely agreed to be carcinogens and the Department's particular attention is drawn to them from a number of expert sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mystery is why those two substances are not banned in the regulations. There is a safeguard clause—article 12 of the directive—which enables a member State
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the basis of a substantiated justification" to prohibit provisionally the marketing of a cosmetic product which represents a hazard to health. That having been done, and the other member States and the</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Commission having been informed, a stated procedure set out in the directive is to be followed. The mystery is why, after this long time in making the regulations here, we did not follow that procedure in regard to these hair dyes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen correspondence on this point between the Department and Professor Harnden of Birmingham university department of cancer studies on this point. If, as stated in that correspondence, the Ministry is
	<br><blockquote><p>"quite prepared to take advantage of this 'safeguard' clause whenever necessary"</p></blockquote>
I am still unable to understand why appropriate action was not taken on the two hair dyes in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hesitation is in regard to "substantial justification", can my hon. Friend say just what he would consider to be such justification? This is where I believe that the lack of time for some cancer experts to consider regulations in depth is so unfortunate, if not deplorable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can my hon. Friend also say whether the two hair dyes are among those to which the Toilet Preparations Federation refer in its letter to members of the Committee as having been referred to the Commission? I quote from the letter which states that a number of materials have been
	<br><blockquote><p>"referred by the Commission to a special scientific body set up for the purpose of reviewing the safety of cosmetic materials. This is called the Scientific Committee on Cosmetology."</p></blockquote>
A similar problem arises, although in a different form, with regard to chloroform in toothpaste. This is permitted up to a level of 4 per cent. It is a week carcinogen but a carcinogen none the less, and I believe that it should have no place in toothpaste which is used by adults and children—and often eaten by children as well. It is one of the substances provisionally permitted by the regulations but no information about its presence is required on the container or anywhere else, so it is possible for us to buy toothpaste containing 4 per cent, of chloroform without knowing what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I fail to see why we overran the EEC deadline by eight months and still took no action about chloroform despite representations by Birmingham university department of cancer studies about its
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
undesirability. This is very puzzling and no action appears to have been taken about these most hazardous products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, approval of 3 per cent, lead acetate in hair care products without any labelling requirement is permitted. There is a curious paragraph at the end of the Department's letter to Professor Harnden, dated 9th November 1978, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The decision to permit the use of lead acetate in hair care products up to a maximum concentration of 3 per cent, and subject to certain labelling requirements (specified in part III of schedule 2 to the regulations) was reached after full consideration of all the relevant factors in consultation with our advisers in DHSS. As the requirements in question had to be imposed under the Consumer Protection Act, we were unable to require the naming of this ingredient on the label but we shall keep this in mind when remaking the regulations in due course under the Consumer Safety Act. In any case, the precautions to be taken, which must be specified on the label, are probably more important than the naming of lead acetate as an ingredient."</p></blockquote>
That puzzles me. I cannot understand why—since, as I have already pointed out, we overran the EEC deadline by eight months and still took no action—we could not have held up the making of these regulations a little longer in order to bring them in under the Consumer Safety Act instead of the Consumer Protection Act. That would have enabled us to carary out the labelling, which Professor Harnden was seeking the opportunity to do. No doubt, there were departmental reasons for not delaying, but it seems strange to introduce regulations under one Act and then, at an unspecified point of time, to introduce fresh regulations under a different Act. It seems to be an unnecessary waste of labour and effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to comment on one point that has been drawn to my attention, although probably he will feel that this is not an aspect on which he should comment. I understand that there was only one independent medical representative on the original EEC cosmetics committee—Dr. Hjorth of the Danish Government department—and that the other doctors on the committee were all employed by cosmetics firms. Dr. Hjorth resigned because of what he felt was the committee's bias towards the pharmaceutical industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the cosmetics industry, with which I have had many contacts in the past, is highly organised, whereas cosmetics users are not. It is for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
that reason that I have sought this further opportunity to discuss the regulations, and I confess that I am very disappointed that we have not taken the opportunity provided by the directive to amend them in the positive way that I suggest. I am left with a slightly bad taste in my mouth by these long-awaited regulations, which I had hoped to be able to welcome wholeheartedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret the disadvantage at which some consumers and independent medical experts seem to have been placed by the regulation-making process. In particular, experts in toxicology who can give independent views on safety matters are not mentioned in relation to the decision-making process, either here or in Brussels. Their advice would seem to be vital, and I hope that my hon. Friend can indicate the names of any such experts who have been consulted, either when he replies today or by writing to me later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Craigen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to speak after the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mrs. Butler). Can the Minister clarify three points in connection with the regulations? Does he not consider that regulation 3 is likely to lead to a fairly considerable amount of litigation and requests to the courts for interpretation? For example, is an allergic reaction considered to be a damage to health?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On regulation 4, does not the Minister feel that to introduce the word "trace" defeats the whole object of the regulation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On regulation 6 in respect of enforcement, would the Minister comment on whether the practice in the United Kingdom, where it is mainly local authority laboratories that undertake consumer protection research, contrasts with the situation in other member countries of the Community where there tend to be more specialist laboratories?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.46 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Laurie Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only briefly to reinforce one of the later points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mrs. Butler) on the absolute importance in all scientific discussions leading to action of having a toxicologist present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green because over many years we have been engaged on this matter and asking parliamentary Questions seeking to obtain the same safeguards as, after the thalidomide tragedy, we were at last able to obtain in pharmacology with the Committee on Safety of Medicines. It is a tragedy that in this country, although we have chairs of pharmacology, so far no university has yet established a chair of toxicology, yet the adverse effects of a number of substances not only in cosmetics or medicines but also in everyday foods such as bread—can have injurious and harmful effects upon the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore strongly support the plea of my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green that to the scientific group that looks at such things—whether through the medium of the EEC or in terms of advice to our own Department of Prices and Consumer Protection—there should be available the expert advice of a toxicologist, independent of any of the interests concerned, for the protection of consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations are of the greatest importance to consumers. Cosmetics are now produced in increasing amounts, with growing sophistication and a variety of novel applications. It is to be welcomed that the regulations now provide safeguards against health hazards in such products. It is a tribute to the industry that the industry itself welcomes the regulations. That is confirmed by the Cosmetics, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, which represents the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the considerations that we are now discussing apply also to medicinal products but they are the subject of another directive. It is, however, worth putting on record that many skin creams, for example, contain the same ingredients and may be allergenic to some people. It is as well that there should be safeguards, even though they are not applied in this set of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interest and activities on these issues over the year of the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mrs. Butler) are well known and respected in the House. We are indebted to her for the occasion of this debate. Having said that, however, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
can express little sympathy with the points that she made. The character of the regulations is welcome in that they propose a form of negative licensing. Ingredients which may not be used are defined and so outlawed, and only if an ingredient is subsequently found to be harmful will it be added to the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That approach is much in vogue in the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection. It is in the spirit of our attitude in this country to so many affairs and is even analogous to our attitude in law that a person is innocent until proved guilty. In this case, an ingredient is deemed innocent until it is found to be harmful. I should not wish to see an approach made the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor would I wish to see us going beyond the scope of the European directive. Indeed, the complaints is that we suffer from European directives. They are often too oppressive a burden for our systems and institutions. I think that if we are in accord with the directive, that is as far we need go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor can I accept the complaint that there has been no opportunity for the institutions to cover these matters. It is very difficul to sustain the argument that we should have met the original deadline in January of this year and at the same time complain that we have reached this point in December and the various bodies involved have not had the opportunity to make sufficient representation on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Joyce Butler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I did not make the point clear. As we have overrun the time by so much—I am not complaining about that—it is a pity that the experts who were asked to give advice were not aware that there was an extension of time. I have spoken to people at the Medical Research Council, and they were under the impression that they had to reply by the end of January this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether or not that is so, the obligation is on those professional bodies to be on the alert and to know day by day how interests affecting their members and their activities are proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So often we come to Committee and are deluged at the last minute—sometimes even when we leave the Committee—with weighty professional representations
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
arriving too late. Surely, it is the prime responsibility of such organisations to ensure that they keep an eye on what is happening in Parliament and brief Members at the appropriate time well in advance of the subject coming to us for a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that this will not be the end of the matter anyway. As scientific research develops there will be new discoveries about ingredients. Some ingredients, as the hon. Member fears, may be found to be harmful although they are accepted now. Others thought possibly to have harmful effects may be found not to have those qualities. So this is just one point in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another feature of the regulations which I warmly welcome, and for which the Minister will be able to claim credit, is that they allow flexibility and urgent action. If it is discovered that some ingredient in a cosmetic is positively harmful or dangerous, he will now have the power to act quickly to suspend the sale and marketing of that product while a thorough investigation is made. For once I am with him in thinking that regulations are an appropriate way of dealing with this matter. They give him a flexibility to act according to circumstances in an area where inevitably there will be changes of medical and scientific opinion from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the need for all ingredients in cosmetics to be listed on the packaging. It should be sufficient that any known ingredients having an allergenic effect should be stated on the packet so that people may be warned off those products. But to list all ingredients would take us to absurd lengths. I have here with me an American product in a package on which all 32 ingredients of a cream are listed, the net weight of which in the container is 2 ozs. The list takes up one side of the pack. Perhaps on this occasion it could be taken as read. I wish that I could pass it to the Official Reporter and have it set out in 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Prices and Consumer Protection (Mr. John Fraser)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because the hon. Gentleman cannot pronounce them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because my English does not go so far as to be able
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
to pronounce them, and I doubt that it is English anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut that all those 32 ingredients should be listed. Some of them may have no significance, and it would only bewilder and confuse the average consumer to the extent that, faced with all that small type on the side of the packet, most people would ignore it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I accept the hon. Lady's point that, if a person suffers a reaction, her medical adviser should be able to ascertain what is likely to have caused that reaction. That could be met by the other provision, namely, that the manufacturer, and presumably the manufacturer's location, is identified on the package as well so that if a patient suspects that her cosmetic is the cause of some skin reaction or infection at least the opportunity to investigate it is there. That seems to be sufficient to meet the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations are not the end of the story. At some time we must discuss product liability. Although the regulations may ban ingredients which in the present state of medical and scientific knowledge are known to be injurious to health, we may come to the point in the House of having to provide compensation for people injured by such products even though, when they were made and sold, there was no evidence that they were in any way harmful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is part of a continuing story. I welcome the regulations for providing, for the first time, much-needed safeguards in regard to cosmetics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.56 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jill Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to hear the Minister's comments on the remarks of the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mrs. Butler) regarding the inability of those involved to find sufficient time to make their own investigations and comments. I am not happy about her remarks, as these regulations—to quote her words—"have now become operative and cannot be changed." One becomes uneasy when doubts are cast on the time scale of the operation, on whether those responsible had the full facts about when the regulations were to be made and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always feel uneasy, too, about people engaged in industry outside having to keep
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
a close and constant eye on everything that goes on in the House. Although my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Mr. Neubert) said that any matters affecting their industry ought to be a matter for their concern and they should be able to express their comments quickly, the House passes such a vast load of legislation that it is not always easy, if the time scale is short, for that to be done.

As a member of the Committee, I should have liked a little more expert advice than the one letter I have so far received. If the Minister could tell us a little more about that aspect of the matter I should be grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to know whether it is expected that these regulations will lead to a substantial increase in the cost of some of these goods. I have in mind for example, soap. Regulation 5(7) states that soap which is not in a container will have to be sold with
	<br><blockquote><p>"a leaflet which shall be delivered to the buyer of the soap."</p></blockquote>
Soap is often sold in large stores without a container, as is soap made by the blind. It is possible to buy soap without any paper round it. I am concerned when a law is made whereby a person purchasing a tablet of soap will have to have a leaflet handed to him or her. How shall we ensure that that happens? Will it lead to an increase in inspectors visiting shops that sell soap, standing at the counter to make certain that no purchaser goes away without his piece of paper containing the relevant facts? In these times of inflation, one must be concerned about any action which will push up the price of the goods. I should like to know whether the Minister feels that these regulations are likely to do so substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to know the meaning of regulation 5(1)(	<i>b</i>), which, to me, seems extraordinary. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, has consideration been given to the undoubted fact that the same ingredients can have a different effect on different people. For example, the use of a deodorant may make one skin sting and have no effect on another. Does that mean that an item which irritates exceptionally sensitive skin—I do not think it is always people with sensitive skin who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
find trouble from such products as deodorants—would be highlighted, or would the product be classed as inadmissible because only some people could not use it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are possibly small points, but when the regulations are put widely into practice they could be significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.2 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Prices and Consumer Protection (Mr. John Eraser)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I take the time scale for consultations. A draft directive was issued from the EEC, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mrs. Butler) said, as long ago as 1969. Therefore there has been a period of nine years during which those who wished to comment, whether or not they were consulted, had an opportunity to put their views on the form the regulations would take. They follow very closely the terms of the directive which was republished in 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green has argued more than once that there should have been a further delay—we ought to have made these regulations on 29th January 1978—to take into account some of the representations which she quite properly made to my Department during this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points to be made here. First, some evidence about risk of carcinogenicity of hair dyes and so on has come to light only very recently. That would not be a good reason for holding up the making of regulations which have been under consideration for nine years and which, as I have said, should have been made at the beginning of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The delay in making regulations after the last round of consultations was due to the difficulties of drafting—defining the borderline between cosmetic products and medicinal products. That caused a lot of difficulty in drafting, and that is where the delay occurred. I am afraid that the argument that they should have been delayed because more prima facie evidence was produced about risk in certain products would have been like the argument that one will not buy an umbrella this winter because next winter one hopes to buy a souwester. It was better that we had some regulations for the first time, not merely for the purpose of protecting the consumer but in order to
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
facilitate our export of cosmetics to the rest of the EEC, to which we export—65 million worth every year. Therefore, nothing in the making of these regulations puts out of court the further representations that we have had about particular substances. I shall deal with some of them in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point, which has been put many times by my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green, is that all the ingredients of a cosmetic should be shown on the label. This is a matter of judgment, and here I am sorry to find myself in agreement with the hon. Member for Romford (Mr. Neubert). If information about 29 ingredients of a cosmetic is provided, it is more likely to confuse than to give valuable information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This reminds me of an occasion when, as chairman of a planning committee, I was told of a developer who, in an application to build a factory in an area of outstanding natural beauty, gave a list of about 20 shrubs or plants to be grown round the industrial complex in order to screen it from the road. The planning committee took the matter seriously and imposed a condition that the various shrubs should be grown, listing them in some detail with their Latin botanical names. Consequently, under the planning permission, the developer was bound to grow a number of dandelions, buttercups, daisies and so on. That illustrates how a long list of Latinised names—in that case plants, and in this case ingredients—may serve to confuse rather than educate a member of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the best approach is to try to select those substances which are likely to cause irritation or to be allergenic—this deals with the point raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight)—and to draw the consumer's attention to them. That highlights their importance. But the importance is lost if they are hidden away in a long list of substances and ingredients which the consumer may not understand. I hope that those answers deal with the questions of time and contents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green mentioned in the Adjournment debate and again today two particular substances in hair dyes—2,4-diaminotoluene and 2,4-diaminoanisole. The first is little
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
used in the United Kingdom, if at all. Concern has been expressed about the second, and its use is at present under consideration by a Department of Health and Social Security committee on carcinogens. I hope that her point has been met. Because concern has been expressed, its use is being investigated, and I shall be able to tell my hon. Friend the outcome of the consideration in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing here not with a static regulation but with something that can be amended and improved—both domestically, if we choose to do so, and as a result of consultations which will continue to take place in the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Joyce Butler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, following the recommendations from the DHSS, my hon. Friend is satisfied that that substance is dangerous, what procedure will he follow to deal with the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is dangerous, we can, upon notice to the Commission, take action against it. There is no difficulty. We have to give notice, which is perfectly proper, but we are not prevented from taking action. Indeed, the substance may be caught under regulation 3—this is the overriding obligation on the manufacturers and retailers of cosmetics—which says that they must not in any event
	<br><blockquote><p>"cause damage to human health".</p></blockquote>
Even though a substance may not be mentioned specifically, that overriding provision, which is novel in safety regulations in this country, means that a cosmetic product shall not be allowed to cause damage to human health. It could therefore be caught under regulation 3, though I think it would be more satisfactory to amend the regulations and to mention a substance specifically if it were proved to be hazardous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen), I cannot say whether the manufacturer or the retailer would be prosecuted for a particular substance. I think that there would have to be a significant damage to human health and not merely irritation. It would then be up to the courts to interpret the provision. My hon. Friend may consider that this leaves the matter in vague terms but, in dealing with such items as tests for injurious substances, there is a degree of vagueness until a par-
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
ticular case occurs. However, I think he will agree that it is better to have that safeguard catch-all regulation than not to have the item included in the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Craigen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister agree that that confirms what I said, that we shall have a lot of litigation in this area because of the problems of interpretation which he concedes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think that there will be much litigation. It is by no means uncommon to have to decide, in both civil and criminal law, whether something is or is not reasonable. Although the word "reasonable" permits of a great deal of argument, it does not in practice give difficulty in the courts. Because a criminal offence may be committed, I believe that the regulation will act as a deterrent to manufacturers who feel that a substance is a risk and they would prefer not to take the risk of prosecution rather than litigate about whether it is safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green mentioned chloroform in toothpaste as another example of a substance that ought to be covered. I can tell her that that substance, used in toothpaste, is under consideration by a working party of the Department of Health and Social Security. The working party will meet in January 1979, so we should have the result of its deliberations very shortly. I recognise my hon. Friend's concern on this point, as I believe that another EEC country—Germany—has given notice of its intention to ban the use of chloroform in toothpaste as it is a mild carcinogen. We shall have the experts' opinion shortly and I shall let my hon. Friend know the result of their investigations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about experts on the EEC committee. Time and again, I tell the House and Committees that I am not responsible for the way in which the Community organises its committees. I have enough to do in explaining my own Department's work, let alone of the EEC. We draw upon our own experts—I have already given some examples—and the EEC committee is not the end of the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend would prefer that we should have positive lists of permitted substances so that, by implication, all other ingredients were barred. That would involve a great deal of work, including the work of toxicologists. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
introduction of these regulations by no means marks the end of our work. The directive requires the production, in the not too distant future, of positive lists of permitted substances and consideration whether certain substances, at present permitted, should be prohibited. Thus again, there is an ongoing process—I know that that will get into 	<i>Private Eye.</i>
The European Commission also continues to hold discussions with member States, consumer organisations and the cosmetics industry, with a view to updating many aspects of the existing directive. A first amendment, incorporating some of these revisions, is already under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this is a massive task. The number of substances used in the manufacture of cosmetic products and toilet preparations runs into several thousands, and the preparation of comprehensive positive lists, involving consideration of the toxi-cological data available in respect of each substance, is an immense and time-consuming task. When the directive is amended to take account of this work, we shall be under an obligation to amend our own regulations in the same way, and this we shall do following consultation with all interested bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the work on the toxic nature of some substances, and the process of updating regulations, continues. But, as I said at the beginning, we have been nine years getting any regulations at all, and I am sure that it would not be right to delay them any further because new concerns come to light from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mary-hill asked me also about the exemption for trace elements. That really is a matter of common sense. Certain substances are barred completely as ingredients, but there may be a minuscule content of a particular element or compound which cannot reasonably be eliminated and does not cause a risk to health. It would be unreasonable not to allow that exemption for trace elements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady the Member for Edgbaston asked me about cost. The regulations are not expected to result in any great cost to the cosmetics industry. The hon. Lady's point about soap, if it were right, would give concern. But soap is to be sold with a leaflet only if the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
ingredients require certain precautions to be taken so that a warning is necessary. If, therefore, soap does not include an ingredient which requires a warning because there is no risk or danger, no leaflet or information will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that she could not understand regulation 5(1)(	<i>b</i>) dealing with the three-year rule. That concerns a cosmetic which may be lawful and may cause no harm to health at the time of its manufacture but if, because of a chemical change in the cosmetic it could within three years prove hazardous to human health, under regulation 3 such a warning ought to be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not envisage any manufacturer actually putting on a box "By such-and-such a date, this product will not comply with the regulations". It seems an extraordinary thing to ask manufacturers to do. Is the Minister thinking of ingredients of a cosmetic which would, as it were go off, or is he thinking of ingredients that would, after a certain date, become illegal? I am considering the practicality of the matter and cannot imagine any manufacturer putting such a notice on his product.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not using forensic language, and the regulation covers that bit which will go off. It is not that the manufacturer may be using a substance that will become illegal; it is that there may be an ingredient which, to use the hon. Lady's term—I do not mind it at all—may "go off", causing a hazard to human health. It is not unusual for some medicines to have a warning that the items should not be used after a certain date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And foods, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And foods. It seems perfectly sensible to include that provision in these regulations.
I hope that that deals with the questions that have been raised in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Craigen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of enforcement, is the Minister satisfied that the laboratories in the United Kingdom operated by local authorities will be sufficiently well geared to deal with the extra work load that is bound to arise from these regulations? As he knows, there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
has been almost a doubling of the number of prohibited substances since publication of the 1976 draft, when there were only 301.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local authorities may not themselves have all the scientific facilties to test whether an ingredient or substance breaches a regulation. They employ outside consultants, and I understand that there is no difficulty in obtaining such expert advice. That is the sensible thing for a local authority to do, since otherwise there would be a great duplication of facilities among local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Joyce Butler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his reply. Could he clarify what will be involved in bringing in the regulations under the Consumer Safety Act instead of under the present Act? Is it purely a technical change, or does it involve a fundamental change in the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that my hon. Friend made earlier was that the regulations are made under the Consumer Protection Act. Although I am not sure on exactly what date the Consumer Safety Act received Royal Assent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Butler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On 1st November it became operative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, on 1st November, but we could not anticipate its becoming effective. We now have power under the Consumer Safety Act to require specific labelling. That is a power we did not possess before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in the process of looking at all the regulations made under the original Consumer Protection Act with a view to updating them—in some cases to require labelling, in others to give a defence of compliance with British or other standards which are nominated. That is quite a long process, but it is not a reason for holding up an important measure of consumer protection and trade harmonisation which has been hanging around for far too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
