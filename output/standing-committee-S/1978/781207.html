	<div class='legislation'>NORWAY POUT (PROHIBITION OF FISHING) (No. 3) (VARIATION) ORDER 1978</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Norway Pout (Prohibition of Fishing) (No. 3) (Variation) Order 1978 .(S.I. No. 1379).</p></blockquote>
The fact that the Opposition have put down a Prayer against the order in no way means that we disagree with it, but in the present state of the fishing industry we need every opportunity there is to press the Government to give us as much information as possible about the progress of the negotiations concerning the common fisheries policy. This debate will also be an opportunity for the Minister to give information to the Committee about what has been the helpful effect of the Norway Pout prohibition order and further information about why the variation runs only for the winter months and returns to the old limits in the summer months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the result of the last meeting of the agricultural and fishery Ministers did not lead to success. We now want to know from the Government whether they intend to return to some of the other measures that were discussed before but postponed. I feel that if the postponed measures are brought forward again, this may help to put pressure on the other members of the EEC to come to a final agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is of some importance because the House rises for the Christmas recess at the end of next week, and we could easily be faced with a situation in which the Government came to a decision some time between now and 31st December—as they say they wish to reach conclusions before the end of the year—and we had no opportunity of discussing the matter or voicing our opinions in the House. Therefore it is very important that we should get the maximum amount of information from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Minister today and I hope that it will be helpful information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.33 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Mudd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a brief intervention following the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour). It seems that the orders have now been effectively in operation for one and a half seasons, and I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some idea of the nature of stock monitoring that has been carried out during that period, the information that has been gained, and the Ministry's forward projections of the effects of these measures on stock growth during the next four years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.34 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful for being called by you, Mrs. Butler, although I am not on the list of Members attending the Committee. I have one or two questions that I should like to put to the Minister in relation to the order, particularly regarding by-catch. If I have the Minister's ear, he might consider the question of how effectively this order is being enforced at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was reported to me at the weekend by skippers from my constituency that the Danes were still landing considerable quantities of pout at Esbjerg and landing it in such a way that while the top of the catch landed is pout, underneath there is a considerable quantity of immature fish concealed by the pout. Unless there are more effective methods of making sure that these orders are being carried out, I begin to wonder whether we are going through a pantomime in the Committee and in the House in approving orders of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to hear from the Minister whether the Government have had any further thoughts on the control of vessels. As he will know, when our vessels go into Norwegian waters they are required to report their position to the Norwegian fishery authorities. They are required to inform them when they move to another fishing position. They are required to inform the Norwegian authorities when they finally leave the waters. This makes the surveillance of foreigns boats in Norwegian waters much easier to control than the system we have, which is of Nimrod surveillance generally. Our fishermen ask why they have to report their position
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
in Norwegian waters when foreign boats coming in to our waters are under no such obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must soon make a statement on that. If there is to be some quota regime as a result of the renegotiation of the common fisheries policy, it is essential that the question of enforcement and fairness is uppermost in the way in which it is implemented. I see no reason why the Government cannot, as of now, institute a system whereby every foreign boat coming in to our waters is required to report its position and state when it starts to fish and when it finishes. Until such a system exists, fishermen will not have much faith in any orders that are passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question—I have raised this with the Minister before—is whether it is possible, as we are all partners, so-called, in the European Economic Community, for us to have the right to be at Esbjerg and the other ports to check what is being landed. Our fishermen tell me that they would have no objection if Danish fishery officers were at Peterhead or Aberdeen or any of our ports to check the validity of our declared catch. Is there any reason why we cannot post fisheries officers at the other ports in the Community, either on a random basis or on a regular basis depending on the requirement, so that we can do an independent check on whether these various orders are being carried out or whether a form of cheating is going on? Fishermen are convinced that, despite the pout box order, other vessels are still cheating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be any confidence at all in any agreement negotiated, that agreement will not be worth the paper on which it is written unless there is adequate and proper enforcement. To date, we have not had a clear indication from the Government about the methods they are proposing for enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) made a strong statement in the Statutory Instruments Committee on Wednesday, 22nd November to the effect that the Government had improved the negotiating atmosphere in Brussels and that there was absolutely no doubt about their determination to get a good agreement. His right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture. Fisheries and Food made a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
similar statement to the House on 28th November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I cannot understand and what I hope the Minister will explain today—I do not think that his right hon. Friend explained it sufficiently—is why the proposals put forward, which the British fishing industry regard as the absolute limit to which we could go, were summarily rejected and yet the Minister can say that he is still confident of getting an agreement by the end of the year? That suggests to me that the only way that that can happen is by a further dilution of demand and by a further weakening in our position. We should welcome the Minister's reassurance on that this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.40 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) referred to the daily situation as something of a pantomime. It is significant that a leader in the 	<i>Fishing News</i> of 24th November 1978 referred to it as "Danish Fairy Tales". That gives some indication of feeling about the way the Danes are treating some regulations and orders which we pass in this House, and it is right that we should bear that in mind today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leader in the 	<i>Fishing News</i> related to a visit by representatives of the Scottish fishing industry to Danish ports to see at first hand what was happening in the Danish fishing industry and to get their reactions to the pout box and the conservations measures which we had introduced. One of the most frightening aspects for the fishing industry is the way in which the Danes have diverted their efforts—to that extent it demonstrates the effectiveness of an order such as this—to other areas with absolutely no thought towards conservation. The leader says that the Danes are
	<br><blockquote><p>"bringing in Baltic herring which size-wise ought to still be in nappies."</p></blockquote>
That is one of the worries. In these present negotiations and in consequence of the orders that we are passing, the Danes, and others of our Common Market partners, are simply not showing the same concern towards conservation as the British fisherman. To some extent, that indicates the difficulties that the Government have had in their negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
The Government must show that from the kind of conservation measures that we pass our fishermen are currently suffering as much as anyone else. Our fishermen are prepared to make the sacrifice which they are making. But it is particularly galling when they go to a country such as Denmark and they see that the Danes are sacrificing in one area and exploiting a species in another area as a consequence. It makes us wonder to what extent they are genuinely seeking conservation, and it makes us appreciate the enormity of the Government's task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I want to make also refers to the Danes and follows on what was said by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson). It concerns control. I do not want to follow him precisely on the point he made, though I shall be interested to hear the answer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is very real concern in the fishing industry about the effect of some of these controls. Let me give an analogy in relation to mackerel fishing, which is another example where, having passed a measure such as this, the Government must carry through the supervision. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East mentioned what the Norwegians are doing and the regulations to which they are subjecting our fishermen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the mackerel side there is grave concern, particularly amongst the smaller fishing boats, in that the larger boats—the purse seiners—are going straight alongside the factory vessels and discharging. As I understand the position, the Government simply accept the word of the skippers of these vessels and the factory ship—normally a foreign vessel—about the amount of the catch. The smaller vessels, which are not landing on to a factory ship, are landing on the British quayside. They are subjected to actual visual control by our own British fishing inspectors and can get away with nothing. Those landing on to the factory vessels are not subjected to visual control. This is a complaint that was made in relation to Ullapool. I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Mudd) will add to what I have said. There is an exactly similar complaint concerning fishermen in that area in that those who are landing from inshore boats are being subjected to far
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
more stringent controls than some of the bigger vessels. It is alleged—I put it no higher than that—that even amongst our own fishermen there are some who are exploiting and going beyond the quota because the Government are not exercising the correct degree of supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make two points in relation to this. I am concerned, first, that if there is any example of our vessels—I do not care what kind of vessels they are—breaching the regulations, we have no right to criticise the Danes in the way I did earlier. I understood that our fishermen were being well supervised, and I hope that the Government can give us some assurance that the supervision is being carried out effectively and properly, otherwise it weakens our whole case in negotiations with our Common Market partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I would make is the simple one of fairness. It is terribly important that in our supervision we are fair not only between one nation and another but between different sections of our own fishing industry. I should be very concerned if our smaller vessels, who find it much more difficult to make a living, were subjected to more stringent supervision than some of the larger vessels simply because of the way the larger vessels operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can have some reassurance from the Minister on the degree of supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to refer to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour). I know that negotiations are taking place at present and that the Government do not have the control in their own hands on when a decision will be made. But I have a slightly hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach, as I know many fishermen have, that a decision may be reached in the middle of December after the House has risen and when it will not be returning until the middle of January. There is great concern that whatever the Government may agree will not be subjected to the parliamentary scrutiny and questioning that such a momentous decision deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a decision is reached in December, or if it looks as though a decision will be reached when Parliament is not sitting, I hope that the Government will delay endorsing that agreement until they can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
come back to the House and obtain the endorsement or otherwise of the House. Only in that way can we reassure the industry that we are genuinely and fully looking after their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.46 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson), I am not a member of the Committee, but I am grateful for the opportunity to be called to add to the discussion of this order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be obvious to you, Mrs. Butler, that there is a great deal of concern about the effects of the order, how long it will last, and how far policing is being carried out. There is a great deal of concern among fishermen over what is happening. How firm the information is about the cheating that is occurring we cannot know, but there are stories that various devices are being used. One example is that of topping up a box with perfectly legitimate species and hiding underneath fish of a size or species which ought not to have been caught. It is very difficult to check on such a practice because the fish have been landed outside the United Kingdom and there is little likelihood of British inspectors being permanently based in foreign ports to carry out checks. I cannot see that as a feasible possibility. We would have to vastly increase the number of inspectors that we already have and would have, first, to get the agreement of our Common Market partners before that could be allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the way that the hon. Gentleman is developing this point, but does he not feel that it would be a valuable one for the Government to negotiate into any common fisheries policy package, and that it might well be one on which we should stick?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly a very interesting point. Put to me on the spur of the moment, it is not easy to give a hard and fast answer. What would concern me about introducing the suggestion at this stage into the negotiations on what we hope will be the new common fisheries policy, is that it might be interpreted by the others as being just another subterfuge which we were introducing in order to prevent agreement. We are in serious enough trouble as it is in trying to get our policies agreed to, and I am not sure that this suggestion could be injected into
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
the discussions as a point on which we could stick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is some merit in being prepared—by bilateral inspections, perhaps, on a random basis, where our people would have access to what has been landed at foreign ports, and we would gladly allow inspectors to come to our ports to examine landings, again on a random basis. If it were put in that way, it might be helpful. I think it would be better if the suggestion were put in as a further method of conservation and not with the attitude "We know you lot are cheating; we are determined whatever else we might do to stop it, and we are bunging this idea in at this point in the negotiations to be awkward." The situation is very delicate and dicey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is some misunderstanding about the precise position we are in regarding carrying on the discussions. It was a month or six weeks ago that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that he hoped to reach an agreement by the end of this year. Following the debacle of the last meeting, he has now modified this to say that he is hopeful that there might be some agreement reached early in the new year. I do not share the view of the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) that the Government are about suddenly to do a deal while Parliament is in recess. Indeed the Government have regularly given pledges on the Floor of the House that any agreement reached among the member nations of the EEC on the common fisheries policy will be put to the House of Commons for discussion and decision before it is endorsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will reiterate that not because I think it is necessary for that to be done from my own or the Government's point of view but because it seems necessary repeatedly to make this point. Fishermen in our ports are extremely upset about what might happen. This is because uninformed journalists are writing detailed articles in the press saying that one of the bargaining points in the discussions on the European monetary system—I shall not discuss that, Mrs. Butler—was that we would give way on fishing. I am quite satisfied in my own mind that this was totally without foundation. These
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
were journalists writing from Brussels to this effect, and I refer particularly to an article in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> written by someone called Michael Fry. I had a telephone call from one of the fishermen—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will return to the main point of this order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am coming to that, because I think the matters are all related. Michael Fry wrote precisely in these terms, and the fishermen are a little worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is not helped by certain, quite irresponsible statements made when the Secretary of State, for the first time since he has been Secretary of State, does not come within 24 hours to report to the House and we get people screaming in the press that this is a sell-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our discussions on fisheries, we ought to take into account the reality of the situation. We ought not to sow the seeds of unrest and espondency in the fishing ports for selfish, narrow, party interests because it is not helping the fishing industry if we maintain at all times that negotiations are not serious and are not genuinely to protect the fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us make no mistake. Our press is read in the EEC, and this is why debates of this kind about the Norway pout order—in which we can express our concern about the fact that we do not believe that the order has been properly enforced—are important. I am sure that the EEC takes account of what we say, listens to what we say and reads what we say in 	<i>Hansard.</i> If they conclude that we are convinced that the Government are not serious in dealing with these orders, that we are going through some kind of charade or pantomime, that we think that the Government are bringing forward these orders as a matter of course, and that they are not serious about enforcement, they will believe it. It might encourage them to say that the House of Commons accepts that the Government are simply playing games, and are on a paper chase putting orders down occasionally to satisfy opinion but are not serious We have to say quite clearly that we believe that the Norway pout order is a very serious and valuable contribution towards conservation, and that Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
ment are looking at all kinds of methods of ensuring that the order is carried out with the greatest effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I believe the Government are serious in these negotiations and are determined to protect British fishing interests, are serious in putting these orders forward and seeing that they are properly enforced. I hope they will give us some assurances about how best we can move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in the past raised issues about checking. The one which comes up regularly and which I support is some kind of bilateral agreement outwith the main negotiations on reporting. I do not think that some of the technical details of the general discussion on the common fisheries policy need wait for the completion of an agreement. We ought to be discussing and negotiating fishing at two levels, at the top the general pattern—because, unless we get that right, all else falls. At the same time, we should be having vigorous discussions about the detail of enforcement to see whether at that level we cannot get agreement about reporting and about such matters as bilateral inspections, and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have this order again before us, which does not apply for all time because it is limited. I hope it gives my hon. Friend the opportunity once again to give confidence to the fishing industry that the Government are serious. It also gives us the opportunity to say both to the Government and to the fishing industry that we stand by them, it is a just cause, and we want to see this just cause being carried forward into a negotiated settlement which is to the benefit of all those who wish for their living in the waters—I dare not use the phrase the " EEC pool", a dangerous phrase—which are within the 200-mile limit of the member States.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter Clegg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a few comments in the common cause of hon. Members who have spoken on this matter this morning. The effectiveness of control is of tremendous importance in setting our future pattern, and we should like to know how the control is working. It appears from what my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) said that the Danes have diverted their fishing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
effort into other areas. It appears on balance that the control has been effective and that they have not been operating to the same extent in the pout box as they had previously. It is worth pointing out, if any news can come forth from the Committee, that to plunder other parts of the North Sea in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns said the Danes were doing is equally dangerous because fish know no boundaries. They swim in and out of pout boxes willy-nilly. Therefore, it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us just what the effect of fishing outside these other areas will have on stocks within our own waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a discussion this morning about the most effective methods of control. It has been generally felt in the House that the licensing of vessels to fish within a particular area is the most effective. The Icelandic system, and now the Norwegian system, to us proved totally effective whilst we were fishing with Icelandic consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other matter that I should like to take up in view of what has been said about mackerel. We have the conception now of the total allowable catch. I think we should now be talking in terms of a total allowable kill, because it is quite clear that a lot of fish are being killed and not included in the count. Most of them are thrown back in the sea to pollute beaches, and that could make a nonsense of the figures, if we are not careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make those points and, once again, say how hon. Members representing fishing constituencies are united in what has been said about the negotiations. We want to see a successful result, and the Minister still has our support in that matter if he proceeds along the lines which he previously indicated to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order enlarges the original pout box and, as such, it has the Opposition's support. We are increasing the area to the eastwards, and the point has already been made by a number of people on this side of the Committee that this will require implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This raises the question of fishery protection and what we are doing to protect
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
the new area by both sea and air. It also raises the subject of effort quotas which have been mentioned so often in this Committee and which came up again today. We underline that fact, and I am sure that both sides of the Committee agree that, when we finally decide on the quota system to be adopted in the CFP it must be by given vessels fishing given areas for a given time and not by the weight of catch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point that has not yet been raised is that the original pout box was very reluctantly agreed by the EEC, but I believe that I am right in saying that the EEC does not agree with its extension. What, therefore, is the present position? What happens when a foreign vessel is arrested by a British fisheries protection vessel in the extended area, if that extension is not agreed by the EEC? Can the Minister say what is happening? Is the EEC going to the court about this or has the EEC now accepted it as a temporary measure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that because of the complications between our own legislation and the EEC legislation, we are creating chaos in the industry. The Minister knows that there are all kinds of rumours going round the industry. It is said that the whole question of the CFP is to be transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Foreign Office. I hope very much that that rumour is wrong and that the Minister will be able to contradict it. The Minister's statement on Monday was an anodyne one, and one wonders why. I understand that the Minister is flying to see Mr. Gundelach in Brussels today. We know that there is no official meeting of fishery Ministers before the end of the year and that the Government, with our support, hoped to reach a sensible solution of the CFP during the presidency of the West Germans, which ends on 31st December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will agree that over the many debates we have had on these forms of orders, the Opposition have been as helpful as possible to the Government. Members on both sides of the Committee have supported the Minister in his battle. But the situation is becoming serious: the fishing industry is in complete turmoil, and all these issues that arise allow more and more rumours which become increasingly wilder. We have already had threats of blocking oil rig supplies, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
similar rumours. I hope that the Minister will be able to allay some of these anxieties and kill some rumours today, and that in any case—I ask him this officially—that he will give an undertaking to the Committee that there will be no settlement of the CFP during the Christmas recess, because it must be fully debated in the House before it is signed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.3 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Hugh D. Brown)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might reply to that last comment immediately. I know that the Prime Minister has a reputation for being able to fix almost anything, but he cannot alter Christmas. There are practical difficulties in giving that assurance to the hon. Member in precise terms. In other words, as the Prime Minister reported yesterday to the House, both my right hon. Friends are having a meeting in Brussels today with the Commissioner, and they will obviously keep the House informed. Whether there will be a meeting of fisheries Ministers is not known yet, and therefore I cannot give the categorical assurance that there will or will not be a meeting which could reach decisions. I can only assure the Committee that it is our intention to seek the agreement of the House on any specific order or agreement which requires the consent and approval of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that a fortnight ago, and I cannot elaborate on it further. The present indications are that it is unlikely that there will be a special meeting of fisheries Ministers between now and Christmas. Obviously that will depend to some extent on the discussions taking place now. I am sure that hon. Members will not expect me to be able to go further than that. However, I know the views of the Committee, and I shall communicate them to my right hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday there was also a debate on fishing matters—on orders that my right hon. Friend the Minister of State dealt with. I begin to feel that this is turning into a weekly chat show of fishing matters and that if it were not for the tolerance and helpfulness of the Chair, we should all be in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been one or two specific questions raised, and I hope that I can reply to most of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
The order has been in operation since 1st October to 2° East. It is a successful measure, and we have no evidence that there are any breaches of it. In my usual churlish manner, I may say to the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) that I wish that when he consults fishermen every weekend, he would not wait until Wednesday or Thursday morning to let me know of the serious allegations—unfounded and unsubstantiated—which he trots out in Committee. I can only advise him—I do not think that he takes my advice—that at the end of the day the fly man does not run out, whether he is a Member of Parliament or a fisherman, or a Dane, for that matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One might say that that last remark was belied by the hon. Gentleman's presence here. The only reason why I waited until today was that I knew that the Minister would be here and would be able to give an answer face to face across the Committee. That is not unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is reporting the proceedings, as far as I know. I was about to say that making such serious allegations might read all right in the 	<i>Press and Journal</i> but it would not kid anyone in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) has left for another Committee but he raised an important matter. It is always a sign that we are in difficulty in making other more constructive comments when we have to drop back to saying that it is only English fishermen who are .honest fishermen. That, basically, is the assumption that was made. My hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) is laughing because he knows one or two fishermen who kid us from time to time. That is one of the most difficult problems to overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems of enforcement: nobody doubts that. It is the general mood of the House and of all hon. Members who have some knowledge on fishing matters that there is no doubt that we are all moving forward toward some kind of better enforcement system, whether it be based on licensing and on quotas and all the other forms of inspection such as we have introduced in the mackerel
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
catch. There is no doubt that we are increasing the effectiveness of measures in all countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I throw this into the scene in terms of the current climate and the negotiations that are taking place. I can well imagine the furore there would be—the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East would be one of the first—if there was some wee Frenchman on the Peterhead harbour every Saturday morning counting the boxes. It would be like the driver in the advertisement—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or an Englishman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, an Englishman might take offence. Given the genuine fears that fishermen in all parts of the EEC have—and we all understand them—it is irresponsible to bring in this kind of emotive nationalism on any or all sides of the argument, but because it is playing down to a bit of prejudice that perhaps is in all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a real problem. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations and whatever the final set-up of the common fisheries policy, there is no doubt in my mind that it will involve an extension of the enforcement facilities. That is inevitable. Perhaps it is looking ahead quite a bit, but an interchange of fishing inspectors would be a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not becoming involved in being a good European. I am looking at the sheer practicalities. It has nothing to do with the EMS. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North said that some of the weekend rumours were really laughable and dangerous. They are not coming from friends of ours. Nevertheless, as regards enforcement it seems to be the pattern or the shape of things to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult for any inspection authority. It is all right to say, as the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns said somewhat naively, that we have visual inspection of what has been landed. However, as far as I know, we have not found any system of getting the fish to tell us where they were caught when they come off the pier. So it is not just what is being landed: it is where it has been caught that is also important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not trying to be un-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
fair. The point I raised was in relation not to where the fish were caught but to the quantity. Quantity is quite a different tale. I hope that the Minister understands that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do perfectly well. If the hon. Gentleman recollects, he said that we had a good system of visual inspection at the landing point. Of course that tells those whose job it is to know the size and the weight of the catch. But it does not tell them where it was caught. To some extent, the hon. Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg) raised the same matter in a different way. He said that there was evidence that the enforcement of the pout box working because it was putting pressure on other areas. He is right: that is perfectly true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I am saying, without being complacent, is that the system is working. The effectiveness of the order we are discussing this morning has been accepted. We have no evidence of any breach of it. Constant inspection takes place, as hon. Members know, and therefore without hard evidence from any member of the Committee, I can only repeat that I am reasonably satisfied that the system is working well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one more point on the effectiveness of the order. May I refresh the memories of Committee members on a near recommendation in 1975? It was blocked at that time by the Danes. There is absolutely no doubt that in the past two to three years there has been a remarkable change in attitude by many of our European partners. This is evidence of it. The extension to 20°E is not backed by the Commission, but nevertheless it accepts evidence of the pout box as a principle. As a conservation measure, it has been accepted by the Commission and, however reluctantly, by our European partners. Therefore, that is a measure of the success in broad general terms of the conservation policies that we have consistently pursued over the past two or three years. But that is small comfort, because we still do not have an agreement satisfactory to the industry. Nevertheless, on the specific point of the pout box, British interests are entitled to some credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least we are now getting acceptance on the application of sound principles of conservation. Of course they are important. For example, it is estimated that if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
there were a total ban on industrial fishing—I am not suggesting that we should argue this point—there could be a gain of 200,000 tonnes of haddock and whiting. With a 2°E box, we estimate that the increase will be 129,000 tonnes a year, and even with a 1°E box it is estimated that there will be 116,000 tons of additional fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a reasonable man. Perhaps the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire East does not think so, but I like to think that I am. I do not believe that we shall get a solution or a reasonable agreement out of the EEC unless we make some attempt to understand the problems, even of the Danes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Putting myself in the other guy's shoes I can well imagine what would happen if there were fishmeal factories closing in my constituency and I was a Danish Member of Parliament, may be even a Socialist. I would be complaining. I do not think I would personally, but I know some colleagues, little Englanders, who would be blaming the British for their difficulties. I am not being irritable or getting at hen. Members, but it does not help if we do not show some understanding of the difficulties of others from whom we require to get consent and agreement at the end of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who stir up this anti-Danish stuff do a disservice in the long term. I think that is evident from some of the Scottish fishermen who were over in Denmark recently. These exchange visits are marvellous. I wish I had the time to go on them. The fishermen were pilloried because they showed some sympathy for the problems that were facing their counterparts in Denmark. I think we can overdo this anti-foreigner, anti-European line at times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should conclude by commenting on some of the weekend rumours, because this was something that the hon. Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) raised. Of course, it is nice speculative journalism—it always is. The Foreign Office is never the favourite Department in any Government and it is good for kicking around when a journalist has nothing else to do. There can be speculation, such so we have the story that my right hon. Friend is going to resign from the Government because he wants to lead the Left-wing anti-EEC group and all the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
other interesting speculations about blockades that I read about at the weekend. Let me make it quite clear. There is no dispute or difference within the Government on our attempt to get a good agreement out of the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the Prime Minister reported to Parliament yesterday and made it quite clear that all the rumours were just rumours. I go even further. The SNP Member who asked the question did not even ask about fishing. Therefore that surely—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members asked about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Prime Minister raised it himself. But the point I am making is that all the rumours and speculation do not make life easier for negotiators. This was the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) made. In the light of the Prime Minister having reported to the House on the EMS and effectively scotched all the rumours, I hope we shall have a reduction in this malicious rumour mongering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Somebody quoted the 	<i>Fishing News.</i> I have news for the Committee. That was so inaccurate that it did not even get the day of the week right—that is, when my right hon. Friend made his statement to the House of Commons. I know the paper is not here but it never seems to report what I say anyway, so I can say it with great freedom. I do not rely on the 	<i>Fishing News</i> for informative information on what is going on in the political scene, however knowledgeable it might be elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that there will be unanimous approval for the order. It is a good one. Along with the other measures which we introduced in July, which have been effective, I know we shall receive the support of the Committee and the House not only on these measures but on our general determination to get an effective agreement out of the EEC which will satisfy all our interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.20 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) apologises that he had to leave to go to another meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister one further thing. I do not think he has really quite explained to us why the changeover
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
of the 2 degrees east takes place at the date specified in the order. I think I am right in saying that he said an extension 2 degrees east gives us another estimated 129,000 tons. Is that based on the extension for six months, which is in the order? If we can get the extra 129,000 tons out of that six months, would it not be as well to put the thing out for the whole year and presumably get double that amount?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, too, that the hon. Gentleman will not think that we on this side are unappreciative of the situation of the Danes, who have a tradition of industrial fishing, but one of the things that came up in our discussions a fortnight ago in a similar Committee, was the fact that certain fish which boats from Hull had gone out to fish—the blue whiting in the Atlantic—had proved to be unfit for human consumption and, therefore, were likely to be able to be fished for fish meal. We had been hoping that these whiting in the Atlantic would be a good alternative to take the place of what had been caught in the previous fishing areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, therefore, to my mind a case for trying to reach agreement with the Danes that, inside the area of the North Sea, where inshore boats can go out for comparatively short distances for fish for human consumption, there is an argument for saying that there should be no industrial fishing in the North Sea but for making an arrangement, not necessarily to stop it tomorrow or the next day, but over a period of years, and allowing time for people to go and do their industrial fishing for a species somewhere else where there would still be the conservation measure of keeping down the amount of industrial fishing in the North. Sea. I am in no way carping'at the Minister, but I feel that these are the sort of things we should be looking at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have made it clear that the figures I quoted are on the assumption that the period for the ban would be for a year. As the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) says, we are only talking about a mixture here in the context of these figures of 2 degrees east for six months and zero degree for six months. We now have this order and are now out further east than we have ever been. The Commission is disputing this. Nevertheless, I am confident that it will be accepted because the principle has been established of having such a box. The gains from it are considerable and the hon. Member has quite rightly reminded me that we have never said that there should be no industrial fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Maybe the industry and Governments will need to turn their attention to the best use of blue whiting. In the circumstances, where there are alternative species that were thought to be—indeed, are—fit for human consumption, but on which there are problems, it may well be that these might offer some alternative sources for industrial fishing or for converting into fish meal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that, in principle, this conservation measure is a good one. It can stand on its own, and we think that we are gradually winning support for its acceptance. Even though this particular extension is under doubt, we think that this is the best time of year to extend the box, and we hope that ultimately we shall get acceptance even for that extension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
