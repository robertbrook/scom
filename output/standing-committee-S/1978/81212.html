	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Thursday next at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>The Lord Advocate.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. Ronald King Murray)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill is a Bill of 55 clauses and five schedules which seeks to make changes in many aspects of criminal justice and criminal procedure in Scotland. It is the most substantial Scottish measure likely to be brought before the House by the Government in the present parliamentary Session. The Bill is not without complexity but this is necessary because of the complexity of much of the law which the Bill is seeking to change. This means that the Bill requires to be read, studied and debated with care, and I hope that both here and at later stages our discussions will be positive and constructive. I am sure that they will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last major reform of criminal justice in Scotland was the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1963. Since then there have been a number of measures affecting Scotland—the Criminal Justice Act 1967 which established the parole board for Scotland; the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, a very valuable and substantial measure of consolidation; the District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975 which introduced the new district courts', the Criminal Law Act 1977 which increased penalties for a large number of statutory offences and substantially increased the power of the sheriff courts and district courts to fine in common law cases tried summarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many hon. Members will recall, it had been the Government's hope to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
introduce a criminal justice measure last Session, but this proved impossible because of the many other pressures on the parliamentary timetable. However, time was found to introduce the Community Service by Offenders (Scotland) Bill, which completed its passage through both Houses and is soon to be brought into effect. This Act introduces a very useful new disposal for the courts—the power to order an offender who has been found guilty of an imprisonable offence to carry out work for the benefit of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, although there has been no major reforming legislation since 1963 on Scottish criminal justice, the Government have introduced some significant reforms in this field, particularly since 1975. We shall be giving early consideration to consolidating the earlier legislation and the present Bill, and, of course, we can build on the 1975 consolidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further reason why the Bill is significant is the intrinsic importance of criminal justice. It must be one of the Government's chief aims to ensure that the criminal justice system is kept under regular critical review. Fairness and efficiency are the two aspects of the criminal justice system which we have had in the forefront of our minds when preparing this Bill. In the criminal justice field efficiency—in terms of staff resources, convenience of witnesses and so on—has to be sacrificed for fairness, which must remain the test of a criminal justice system. But the Bill seeks, so far as possible, to strike the proper balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, of course, is not a final solution to the problem of crime; nor does it pretend to be. There is, naturally, widespread concern at the general upward trend in crime over the years, a trend which continues to be reflected in the figures for 1977 which were published in "Criminal Statistics—Scotland 1977" earlier this month. That is a matter of great importance to many people, as the Government appreciate from the many letters received on the subject of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three main ways in which to tackle crime: long-term prevention, principally through education and by involving parents and the community in fostering socially responsible attitudes among young people; short-term prevention, through improving police efficiency and morale and encouraging a preventive
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
role; and third, by ensuring that the criminal justice system is geared to deal fairly and effectively with those who are charged with crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is at the third method of dealing with crime—ensuring that the criminal justice system is geared to cope with those charged with crime—that the Bill is principally aimed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before turning to consider the content of the Bill, I should perhaps say a few-words about its parentage. The source of a great many of its provisions is the second report of the Committee on Criminal Procedure in Scotland which was chaired by Lord Thomson. We are all very much indebted to Lord Thomson and to his committee for the tremendous amount of work which went into that report, which contained no fewer than 195 recommendations. Many of these are already implemented administratively or through rules of court by act of adjournal. Many more which require legislation are being implemented in this Bill. The other principal source of the Bill is the Scottish Council on Crime and, in particular, its report on fines—a very useful report which was published in October 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working group on identification procedure under Scottish criminal law, which was chaired by Sir William Bryden QC and which reported as recently as April, called for changes, only one of which required legislation and that has been included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Lord Advocate say at this stage why the Government have not sought to include in this Bill the proposals of the Thomson Committee on appeals from conviction on summary procedure? He will be aware that this is a matter of some interest in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman, and I shall have a word to say about that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill was published on 29th November, the Secretary of State announced that, while the Bill as introduced did not contain any provisions in implementation of the third report of the Thomson Committee—"Giminal Appeals in Scotland"—it was the Government's intention that amendments would be brought forward at a later stage to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
provide for changes in the stated case procedure for summary appeals and to introduce a right of retrial in summary cases. I give the hon. Gentleman and the Committee an assurance today that this is still the Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the Bill itself. Although there are many different strands to the Bill, it is possible to pick out certain dominant themes. Rather than go through the Bill clause by clause—there will be plenty of time for that in Committee and, besides, the purpose of each clause is set out in the explanatory memorandum—I propose to identify the prinicpal themes and say a little about each in the hope that that will not be so boring to members of the Committee. I have selected 10 such items as worthy of particular attention, but no doubt members of the Committee will not be slow to draw any others to my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I take the provisions of powers relating to detention by the police. Clause 1 gives the police a limited power to detain persons in any public place, or at the scene of a suspected offence, long enough to ask a suspect about the offence or to obtain, and if possible verify, his name and address—by radio, for example. Power is also given to the police to detain witnesses or others who may have information about a suspected offence, again long enough to obtain and, if possible, verify their names and addresses—a limited power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Lord Advocate explain why that provision is necessary? Most of us had assumed that it existed in the law at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall elaborate on that in a moment, but perhaps I could simply say, in a nutshell, that the idea is to enact what is at present good police practice—to enact it and delimit it—so that the police know where they are and the citizen knows what his rights are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 gives the police power to detain in a police station or elsewhere, for up to four hours, any person they suspect of committing, or having committed, an imprisonable offence. The three purposes for which this power is exercisable are, first to facilitate police investigations, especially where there is a risk that evidence may be destroyed, witnesses influenced or accomplices warned; second, to allow police to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
question the suspect, and third, to enable the police to seek to establish the suspect's identity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the power of detention in a police station, the police may search the suspect's clothing and baggage. These clauses are to a large extent based on Thomson Committee recommendations and clause 2, in particular, seeks to regularise and delimit present police practice. At present, there is no legal power to require a suspect to come to a police station, and the police can do no more than invite a suspect to come with them to the police station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two clauses seek to put good police practice on a sound legal footing, defining both the police powers and the citizens' rights in this very sensitive area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in saying that these proposals do not go so far the Thomson Committee report recommends, and could the Lord Advocate say why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite correct—the proposals do not go as far as the Thomson Committee recommendations. I do not wish to get into a discussion on the clause in opening what is, in effect the Second Reading debate in Committee, but, in a nutshell we have sought to strike what we believe to be a sound balance between law enforcement, on the one hand, and the rights of citizens, on the other. For that reason, we feel that the balance struck in the Bill is preferable to that suggested by the Thomson Committee. But that is, no doubt, a matter upon which the hon. Gentleman would wish to reserve his views and pursue it in Committee
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 gives a person detained under clause 2 and a person arrested under existing powers the right to have a message about his detention or arrest and his whereabouts sent to one person reasonably named by him, I should say that for Glaswegians "message" means "communication" in this context. That would usually be a relative or a friend. The existing statutory right for an arrested person to have his solicitor informed of his arrest and to see him before appearing in court will continue as before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, part II of the Bill provides for the abolition of money bail and its replacement by an offence of failing to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
appear and for a system of release on conditions. I indicated that there were 10 items. I am now on the second.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, will hon. Members keep their voices down or go out into the corridor? Others want to hear the Lord Advocate, if they do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful, Mr. Doig.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbaim</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that Lord Thomson recommended it, but can the Lord Advocate explain why it would not be more sensible to have money bail retained as an alternative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see the force of the point, but if he analyses the reasons which the Thomson Committee gave on the question, the hon. and learned Gentleman will, I think, see that those arguments really go to the complete abolition of money bail. However, I shall have some more to say about it, and, no doubt, the hon. and learned Gentleman will raise it during the debate. It is a matter that cannot be resolved quickly on an intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Thomson Committee received much evidence to the effect that the finding of money bail by the accused was an irrelevance to securing the attendance of the accused at the subsequent court proceedings and that the system involved a great deal of work in collecting and accounting for bail money. The committee noted that the amounts of bail usually fixed were low, a finding strongly supported by the subsequent Scottish Office social research study entitled "Pretrial Bail and Custody in the Scottish Sheriff Courts", which was published in 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That study found that although the amounts of bail fixed in the sample under review varied from 50p to £1,000, the average amount was as low as £13.80 and the most common sum was £10. Despite the smallness of the sums fixed for bail, as high a proportion of those granted bail as 27 per cent, were not able to find the bail money immediately and spent at least one night in custody. The study found also that there was no significant difference between the average amount of bail which had been fixed for those who subsequently absconded—that is £13.33—and the amount fixed for those who subse-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
quently neither absconded nor offended again, which was £13.95, a very small difference. Commenting on the Thomson Committee's recommendation that money bail be abolished, the authors of the study report estimated that there would be a drop of over 2,000 a year in the number of needless committals in custody from the sheriff courts alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the answer I would give to the hon. and learned Gentleman. He may ask: Why not have a safety net of money bail? The answer to that is that the evidence of this report shows that to be unlikely to be of any value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question which we must ask ourselves is what is the purpose of bail. Principally, it is to avoid the unnecessary holding in custody of those accused of crimes of which they have not yet been found either innocent or guilty. Initially, the court has to decide, having heard the procurator fiscal, whether or not to grant bail, if the accused applies for it. Once the decision has been taken by the court to release the accused, it is clearly desirable to take steps to ensure, so far as possible, that the accused presents himself at future court sittings of which he is given notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the present money bail system seeks to do, but there is strong evidence that it is not relevant to whether or not the accused absconds. What the Thomson Committee proposed, and the Government have accepted, is that there should be criminal sanction for failure to appear—that release should be on conditions. The principal condition, of course, is that the accused appears for trial when required, but the Bill also gives the court power to impose other conditions as it thinks fit to try to ensure that the accused does not commit an offence while on bail—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman say what guidance the Scottish Office of his Department will give to sheriffs in relation to the conditions which might be substituted for money bail?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of which, I think, I should require notice, but I can say here and now that it is not the practice in Scotland to give guidance of this kind to judges. I see the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. It is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
obviously desirable that information should be available—not just the bare bones of the statute—by way of general background so that judges are aware of all the facilities which can be made use of in imposing conditions. That is a matter to which we can return at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also seeks to ensure that the person on bail, the accused, does not interfere with witnesses, tamper with evidence or obstruct the court of justice, and that he makes himself available for interview in connection with the preparation of, for example, social inquiry reports. These are all matters that have to be taken into account in imposing suitable conditions of bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sanction which the court may impose on an accused who fails to appear at a trial of which he has been properly notified, or who breaks any of the conditions on which he is released, is a fine of up to £200 on conviction, or, if imprisonment is being imposed for the original offence with which he was charged when granted bail, up to 60 days' imprisonment on conviction in the district court or up to three months on conviction in the High Court or sheriff court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system of release on conditions, which will continue, as I imply, to be called bail, has two chief advantages. It should help to ensure that people are not unnecessarily held in custody pending trial, and it should also prove a more effective means of ensuring that the aims of bail are met. The sanction for nonappearance or for breach, of conditions under the new system will be much more severe than the forfeiture of the petty sums of money currently fixed for bail. There will also be an incidental benefit that some savings of staff time and cost will be made by the abolition of money bail and of the machinery for collecting and accounting for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, the Bill contains a number of provisions designed to reduce the use of^ imprisonment, and I am sure that members of the Committee will welcome that. The fact that we in Scotland have one of the highest male prison populations in Western Europe per head of population is a matter of no pride whatever. The bail reforms which I have just mentioned should result in some reduction in the number of those being held in prison before trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also proposes several innova

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
tions which seek to reduce the number of people sentenced to imprisonment after conviction. Clause 36 provides that where a person of or over 21 years of age is convicted of an imprisonable offence but has never before been in prison or in detention, the court shall not impose a prison sentence on him unless it considers that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate, and then only after considering a social inquiry report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 35 provides that where any person is convicted of an imprisonable offence but has never before been in prison or in detention, the court may not impose a custodial sentence without the accused being legally represented in court—unless he is not eligible on financial grounds for legal aid or has failed to apply for legal aid despite having been told of his right and being given an opportunity to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 47 introduces a power for Scottish courts to suspend an part—one quarter to three quarters—sentences of imprisonment of over six months but not exceeding two years. The principle of this clause is to give suitable offenders, in particular first offenders, a taste of the unpleasantness of prison and the prospect of a further spell of imprisonment if they misconduct themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 43 amends the table of maximum periods of imprisonment which may be imposed when an offender defaults in the payment of various levels of fines to reflect changes in the value of money and the increased fining power of the courts. This should result in lower sentences being served in default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourth, and closely related to the measures seeking to reduce the prison population, there are provisions in the Bill on the treatment of drunken offenders. Clause 4 is an indication of the Government's desire that in time—I accept that it cannot be achieved overnight—there will be developed in each major urban area a nexus of appropriate facilities for the care in the community of persons with drink problems, including in each case a unit to which the police can take habitual drunken offenders, instead of arresting and charging them, and where they will be dried out and directed to appropriate facilities for their further treatment and rehabilitation. This is an integrated whole required to deal with the problem. I have to stress that this will take time since the Government's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
advice is that the provision of a detoxificaton unit before the treatment facilities are there would make matters worse rather than better, depriving those unfortunates of at least the food, shelter and rest which however inappropriately, prison provides for them. But in times of financial stringency and other demands on the resources of local authorities and health boards, these treatment facilities cannot unfortunately be developed quickly. It is encouraging that in a number of urban areas of Scotland plans for treatment facilities are being developed, including detoxification units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifth, the Bill contains a group of provisions relating to fines enforcement. It is hoped that these changes will improve the efficiency of the fines collection system. This is clearly desirable for its own sake and should lead to a reduction in the proportion of those fined who are ultimately imprisoned in default of payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While on the subject of fines, I should mention that it is planned to introduce fines enforcement officers on an experimental basis in Airdrie and in part of Edinburgh for a period of three years. The experiment follows on a recommendation of the Scottish Council on Crime. The principal function of the fines enforcement officers will be to visit fine defaulters and obtain information to assist the court. In particular, it is hoped that personal contact at an early stage will persuade a larger proportion of those cited to attend means courts to attend, that obtaining details of defaulters will help sheriffs and justices in disposing of cases, and that the visits which the fines enforcement officers will make to fine defaulters when they are about to be imprisoned for default will reduce the proportion of defaulters who end up in prison for default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixth, the Bill introduces a new sentence for the 16 to 21 age group. As far back as 1969, the Scottish Home and Health Department published a memorandum which recommended the abolition of the three existing custodial sentences for this age group—borstal training, detention in a detention centre or in a young offenders institution—and their replacement by a new single generic sentence. It received a fairly general welcome, and it is interesting to note that the basic proposition of amalgamation was subsequently adopted by the Advisory Council on the Penal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
System in England and Wales in its report "The Young Adult Offender".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 37 seeks to implement that recommendation by removing the three present sentences and substituting a single sentence to> a youth institution. The proposal recognises that the main effect under all three present sentences is the loss of liberty, and that the existence of three different sentences introduces harmful rigidities into the best use of our institutions to meet the needs of inmates for different regimes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. and learned Friend confirm that, in effect, that means the end of the indeterminate sentence? Borstal training, for example, is an indeterminate sentence. Will the sheriff on all occasions have to put an exact term on the sentence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm what my hon. Friend says. The courts would have power to sentence young offenders for a period up to the maximum period of imprisonment which might have been imposed on an adult on conviction of the same offence in the same court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seventh, the Bill gives the Secretary of State power to make specific grants to local authorities for hostels for adult offenders under supervision. Again, I am sure that this will be widely welcomed. Local authorities in Scotland with social work responsibilities already have power under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to provide hostel accommodation for adult offenders under supervision, that is, offenders on parole, on compulsory after-care or on probation. However, only very limited accommodation has been made available, which is unfortunate because I believe that the provision of such accommodation would mean that there would be a suitable place to which the courts might send, for example, offenders whom they wished to have under fairly close probation supervision. One hopes that probation would be used more than it has been recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, offenders who would be suitable for a probation sentence involving supervision with a residential requirement are often being given prison sentences or released into the community with less supervision than might be desirable. Similarly, where it might be appro-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
priate to try to isolate a released offender on parole or compulsory after-care from a particular home or criminal background, hostel accommodation would foe very desirable. I hope that clause 51 will encourage local authorities to bring forward proposals for hostel accommodation for offenders and to take advantage of the incentive provided by this new grant provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eighth, the Bill extends the jurisdiction of the district courts. Section 285 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 circumscribes the power of the district courts. Clause 13 eases some of these restrictions. The Government hope that this provision will result in some work being diverted from the hard-pressed sheriff courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ninth, the Bill extends the restrictions on the publication of information likely to lead to the identification of children involved in criminal cases. At present, the law prohibits the publication of children's names only in the summary courts and only in respect of an offence by a child. It does not apply to trials on indictments or to appeals against conviction in a summary court. While a higher court has power to prohibit the publication, this is not always used. Yet the same considerations—the notoriety, the distress, the damage to< a child's successful re-establishment in society—apply to children equally in these other courts. Clause 25 therefore extends the prohibition to all cases involving children and to all courts. As at present with summary courts, the court or the Secretary of State would have power to lift the prohibition if it was in the interests of justice to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenth, and last—but by no means least—the Bill introduces a large number of improvements in criminal procedure. I do not intend to list all the many provisions in the Bill which fall into this category. Most of them derive from the Thomson Committee's second report. I shall mention one or two of the more significant changes. Clause 20 makes new provision for the prevention of delay in trials, in both solemn and summary trials. That includes the Thomson recommendation in regard to the 110-day period—that that should run to the commencement rather than to the conclusion of the trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 17 implements a recommendation of the Bryden working group by giving an accused the right to apply to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
sheriff for an order requiring an identification parade to be held where the prosecutor has not held one at his own instance or has refused or failed to hold one when requested by the accused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 27 and schedule 1 simplify the arrangements for taking routine evidence, subject to appropriate safeguards for the accused. One provision that perhaps requires special mention is clause 31. It is a source of pride that in general no one can be convicted of a crime in Scotland on the uncorroborated evidence of one witness, and the Government will firmly defend that principle. But when it comes to the enforcement of parking regulations, such a safeguard reaches the point almost of absurdity, with increased cost and reduced enforcement, as traffic wardens parade in pairs to write down the licence numbers of offending cars.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Registration number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Registration number—did I say something different?—the licence number or registration number, as the case may be—or no doubt both. In the case of these very minor "ticket" offences, the Government propose that the evidence of one witness should be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 provides that sheriff and district courts will not be required to sit on a Saturday, Sunday or court holiday, although the court may sit on those days if necessary. It also provides that each sheriff principal may prescribe up to 10 days per year as court holidays for the courts in his sheriffdom. This clause is a recognition of the great difficulty of finding staff prepared to work on the preparation of cases for Saturday courts. To avoid unnecessary detentions over the weekend, the power of the police to liberate arrested persons, at present confined to minor cases triable in the district courts, will be extended by clause 11 to sheriff court cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Bill is a well structured measure which seeks to strike the right balance between the powers of the police and the rights of the citizen in relation to detention; between the public interest and the rights of the accused, innocent until proved guilty, in the proposed reform of the bail system; between custodial and non-custodial disposal in the treatment of offenders; and between
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
fairness and efficiency in reforming the criminal procedure system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the Bill to the Committee as a carefully considered and, I believe, constructive contribution to the evolution of our criminal justice system in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.2 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole Committee will want to thank the Lord Advocate for the very agreeable and helpful way in which he has introduced the Bill. He always answers our questions most authoritatively and we are grateful to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been waiting for the Bill for a long time—I think about 15 years—and it will probably be another 15 years before we get another Criminal Justice Bill. I have a suspicion that the lack of business in the Committee—if one may so put it—may be one reason why we now have these matters before us. We must therefore consider whether the Bill is appropriate and whether it contains the right ingredients which we should expect in a Criminal Justice Bill, bearing in mind the background in Scotland of the rather dramatic and frightening increase in crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) will be answering for the Opposition and dealing with some of the detailed points which the Lord Advocate raised. I think it right at this stage to give our general reaction to the Bill which has been put before us as a Criminal Justice Bill. Of course, we accept that some parts of the proposed legislation are helpful and welcome. On the other hand, I do not think that it will make any significant impact on the upsurge in crime, although it will certainly result in fewer criminals being put in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tests that we should apply to the Bill are, first, whether it will make life more secure for the law-abiding citizen; secondly, whether it will help to deter potential criminals; and third, does it show that the Government are treating crime and its remedies as a top priority? The initial reaction anyone must have on reading the Bill and on hearing the Lord Advocate's speech is that there is nothing in the Bill that will give criminals in Scotland any reason to sleep less safely in their beds tonight. If anything, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
only result will be that fewer of them are likely to go to prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr- Norman Buchan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the hon. Member said that he expected it would be another 15 years to wait before we had another Criminal Justice Bill, and since he says that there is nothing in this Bill that will give criminals any reason to sleep less safely in their beds, does that mean that he does not expect to win an election for 15 years or that he has given up all his fire-eating habits of declaring war on crime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, and I was hoping to deal later with the alternative remedies which a Conservative Government would bring forward, if they had the opportunity to do so, but I do not want to stray out of order by dealing with that too much at first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) will accept that there is need today for a Criminal Justice Bill with more sweeping changes than are proposed in the Bill before us. The facts are all too clear. We see them in the criminal statistics recently published by the Government. It is a significant reflection of the priority given to the subject that the statistics relate to 1977 and were published in December of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see that crimes and offences just about doubled over the past five years from 168,000 in 1973 to 301,000 in 1977. We see a dramatic rise in housebreaking, that murder has again broken the records, and that violence is at an all-time high. An answer given on 9th February by the Secretary of State and printed in 	<i>Hansard</i> shows that over the past 20 years murder convictions are up from two to 50; attempted murder from three to 50; culpable homicide from eight to 32; rape from six to 28; and crimes of violence from 581 to 1,256. In other words, there has been a sharp and sustained savage rise in crime. That should give us all cause for concern, and our anxiety should be, through any Criminal Justice Bill, to find an answer to what has been a dramatic upsurge in crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second cause of major concern has been the fall in the detection rate. This year we have seen the detection rate at about the lowest recorded in recent years, with the detection rate for all crimes at about 28 per cent; meaning that almost
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
three out of four crimes are not detected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few years there has been a dramatic slump in police morale. Only two years ago, resignation in England and Wales were at an all-time high, and in Scotland, although not a record, they were at a very high level. That desperate situation led to the Edmund-Davies report, and even then the Government insisted, against our judgment, on phasing its recommendations forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also seen a serious situation in the prisons, in which there has been sporadic industrial action. Despite the enormous pressure on the prisons, the Government have virtually abandoned a prison-building programme. We saw in the recently published annual prison report, entitled "Prisons in Scotland", reference to the fact that it was necessary to defer certain desirable capital building projects and to limit the development of other services in penal establishments, particularly social work and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have before us, therefore, a general picture of a desperately serious and urgent problem, to which the Government should find an answer and show that they are giving top priority to it. We have a shameful and alarming record and a clear indication that the right sense of urgency is not being shown by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Advocate mentioned that one of the main objectives and results of the Bill would be to send fewer people to prison. Will that of itself help the battle against crime? The implication being drawn from the numbers in prison in Scotland is that we send far too many to prison and for far too long. I hope that those who take that view—and the Lord Advocate in particular—will look at the interesting tables published in the annual prisons report. It shows that the number of people in prison depends on three factors: first, the total number of criminals; second, the sentencing policy of the courts; and third, the length of sentence. It is interesting that in each of the past four years the sentencing policy factor has accounted for a substantial reduction: in 1974, for example, down 5 per cent., in 1975 down 6.5 per cent., and in 1976 down 11.5 per cent. So there has been no indication that the courts have been imposing longer sentences and sending more people to prison. If anything, there has been a move in the other direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
I come now to the general points in the Bill. First, we have the powers of search. Those who are opposed to any increase whatsoever in the powers of search are concerned about the possibility of abuse. But there is no need to be scared of that, particularly in Scotland where in 1977, despite the enormous number of crimes recorded, we had only 1,287 complaints against the police, of which only eight resulted in criminal prosecutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that in this matter the Government have not gone as far as Thomson. I thought it unfortunate, when I asked the Lord Advocate why he had not gone as far as Thomson, that he said that the Government were trying to strike the right balance. Those who took part on the Thomson Committee took the view that they were trying to achieve the right balance and it was not a question of their views having to be set against those of some anonymous liberals who were taking some other view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is desperately important that the power to stop and search, on reasonable suspicion—for example, for offensive weapons—should be included and should be fully covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for bail, the Lord Advocate should answer the important point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) about still keeping money bail as an alternative. But, in general, there is no objection to the introduction of conditions instead of cash, because the latest information we have is that about a quarter of those granted bail spend some time in prison because of a shortage of cash, and about 9 per cent, of those granted bail spent the whole time before their trial in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That must not be used as an excuse for extending the scope of bail. I hope that the Lord Advocate and the Secretary of State will bear very much in mind the remarks made by the chief constable of Grampian in his report for 1977, when he talked about the increasing burden being placed on the courts. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed, it is now quite common for persons charged with serious criminal offences to be liberated on bail pending trial, continuing to commit crimes, and being further charged and liberated on bail, without disposing of outstanding offences … It is highly improper to extend that process to such a degree that individuals charged with serious assaults against law-abiding citizens, or with breaking
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
and entering offences, should be afforded this privilege time and again, very often within hours of their arrest."</p></blockquote>
I therefore hope that the Lord Advocate will make clear that this major change in bail will not be regarded as an excuse for extending the scope for bail, bearing in mind that there is some evidence that there is perhaps too much scope at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On drunkenness, I wonder whether the Under-Secretary in winding up the debate will indicate the extent to which resources are to be made available to local authorities and whether a response on their part will be voluntary. We know that some local authorities, because of the cuts in spending, are having an intolerable time trying to make provision for homeless persons, for the people who are roaming the streets of Glasgow, for example, with nowhere to go. It is a particular problem in my own city, and I wonder whether it is reasonable for the Government to expect local authorities to make this kind of provision when they are finding it very difficult to provide for urgent needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, will the Under-Secretary indicate whether he has a time scale in view—perhaps a period of five or 10 years over which this alternative provision will be made? Bearing in mind the problems which many local authorities are having, particularly as a result of the rate support grant which we shall consider later this week, I hope that the Government will make clear that they will not just pass the buck to the local authority or, alternatively, put forward a provision which they have no possibility of bringing into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Under-Secretary say something—which the Lord Advocate did not say—about clause 37 and youth institutions? Here we have the three alternatives of the young offenders institutions, the detention centres and borstals being replaced with new youth institutions which it is said the Secretary of State shall provide. What has he in mind to provide? Does he expect that existing institutions in the separate categories will be taken over, with new name plates put on them? Is it intended that they will all be the same, with no variation in provision made? Does the Minister honestly think that this will be a factor which will help to reduce crime, particularly among young people? He will have seen from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
the criminal statistics that we have had a savage increase in the amount of crime committed by teenagers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have the new youth institutions there is a strong case for having institutions in which rigorous discipline is applied and in which there will be what my right hon. Friend who speaks for home affairs in England and Wales has been arguing for, namely, a short sharp sentence which will ensure rigorous discipline and also ensure that this has a real deterrent effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope also that the Under-Secretary of State will say something about clause 36. Specific and strong obligations are put on the courts not to send someone to prison unless there is no reasonable alternative, and, of course, in the case of someone who is to go to prison for the first time—not a first offender—every possible step must be taken to make sure there is no alternative and also in his case the courts are to put in writing the reasons why prison was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that not an unnecessary restraint on the freedom of action of the courts? Is there any evidence that the courts have been unreasonably sending people to prison in the circumstances to which this clause relates?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me about clause 36 and the general tenor of the Government's case is that it seems that the only argument that the court has to take into account in relation to clause 36 is the welfare of the criminal. The Bill refers to the special circumstances and to physical and mental health. It seems that the criminal will have a social work report. Have the Government given consideration to whether the local authority officers mentioned in clause 36 have the facilities to provide all the background detailed information that they are called upon to give?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that here, as in so many features of the Government's policy and planning, the courts are being asked in these circumstances to have regard only to the circumstances and the welfare of the criminal himself. Surely, the courts should have regard to the deterrent effect that a sentence would have on potential criminals. That is one of the reasons why we should be considering building up the deterrents, not eroding them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn next to the question of fines.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
Does the Under-Secretary thank that the proposals on fines will make it more likely that fines will be paid? The new relationship between fines and terms of imprisonment makes it possible that it will be more difficult to collect fines. Although it is interesting that the Lord Advocate tells us that he will appoint more public servants to go round to invite people to pay their fines, we have to bear in mind that there is a substantial amount of unpaid fines now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give us some figures on that? There is an enormous distinction between fines that are unpaid when the payment is not yet due and the amount which is written off, which is extremely small.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the amount was not small. I have a letter which I should be glad to pass to the hon. Gentleman. It is the kind of letter that one gets when one cannot get a Written Answer. I believe that the total figure was just under £2 million, though, as the hon. Gentleman says, most of it was made up of fines which were being paid in instalments or under special arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Actually, I put down a Written Question and received a reply with no difficulty whatsoever. A figure of 0.6 per cent, was written off last year as uncollectable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that was the amount that was written off as uncollectable. I know that the hon. Gentleman, who always likes to be accurate on these points, will say that the amount which was written off in fines is not the total amount of unpaid fines, bearing in mind the considerable number of people who are sent to prison because they do not pay fines. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not get involved in trying to distort matters. I think that he will accept that 0.6 per cent, is a misleading figure. This is rather typical of the attitude, to which we object, of some members of the Government party—I certaiinly would not include the Lord Advocate—who seem to go out of their way to try to do everything possible to defend the welfare of the criminal and not that of the law-abiding public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the omissions from the Bill? First, it is unfortunate that the Government have not taken the opportunity to try to do something to build up the deterrent with regard to violent crime and murder. Another report which has been waiting for a very long time is the Emslie report, in which it was specifically stated that we should have a minimum period of years spelt out for a life sentence except in exceptional circumstances. That recommendation was put forward by Lord Emslie and his colleagues because they felt that it would help to increase the deterrent value of the life sentence and thereby reduce the amount of violent crime and murder. It is high time that that recommendation was implemented. There is no reason whatsoever why it should not be included in this Criminal Justice BUI, and I wonder whether the Government will explain why that has not been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, there is nothing in the Bill dealing with vandalism. The Minister will be aware that the recently published Conservative Party report on crime, entitled "Crime and its Remedies"—the report of a group chaired by an eminent QC—proposed that we should have a special crime called "vandalism" to which there should be attached appropriate penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over a period of time I have heard the hon. Gentleman's references to the crime of vandalism. I have always been aware that there was such a crime, known as malicious mischief, and it was capable of being taken on indictment as well as on summary proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads the report he will see the reason why such a move would be helpful, particularly in the case of a second crime of vandalism, because malicious mischief covers a number of offences which could include vandalism and also certain others. Breach of the peace can include vandalism. It was considered appropriate by that high-powered Conservative committee that we should have the crime of vandalism spelt out as such to give an indication of the seriousness with which society regards this crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he has admitted my contention that there is such a crime, or the matter is taken care of either by breach of the peace, by malicious mischief or whatever, then, surely, what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting is that there should be a cosmetic name-change—to bring in the crime of "vandalism" and nothing more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we do not accept that it will be mere name-change. Far from it, particularly in the case of a second offence of vandalism. In such a case it would be far easier for the courts to refer back. For example, a breach of the peace can be anything. A breach of the peace can involve rowdy behaviour. It can involve factors related to drunkenness. It can be vandalism. If someone comes up for a second offence and his charge sheet also shows breach of the peace, there is no specific indication that this was necessarily a crime relating to vandalism. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I am glad to have the support of my legal colleagues. I rather resent the way that the hon. Gentleman is laughing this of as cosmetic. The truth is that the Government's policies are not working. Crime is soaring. People are sick and tired of their lives being made a hell by the increase in crime and vandalism.

The Opposition put forward what we regard as sensible, serious suggestions, having appointed a committee of people highly qualified in the law and its application who believe that their proposal would make a major difference. To that extent, it is worthy of rather more serious consideration than it is being given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will be relieved to hear that I have read with great interest the report of the committee chaired by Mr. Charles McArthur, QC. On the crime of vandalism, I believe that the words were that "mandatory penalties where appropriate" were to be used. Could the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If the short title of the Bill' will enable this to be put in an amendment, I assure the hon. Gentleman it will be spelt out in considerable detail—which is what I should like the Minister to reply on. We

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
appreciate, Mr. Doig, that you are the arbiter and judge of what is relevant and in order, but under the short title I hope that it will be possible to consider such matters, for example, the introduction of the crime of vandalism, corporal punishment or capital punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's main objection to the Bill is that the Government have failed to give adequate priority to the battle against crime. We do not regard this as a joke. We believe that it is a significant blot on the Government's record that we have had a catastrophic increase in crime, which is causing unhappiness, distress and fear to a substantial part of the population. It is a rapidly worsening problem. Crime has doubled in five years, which should give everyone cause for concern. The detection rate has dropped substantially, which also should give cause for concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have also seen the age of those causing the most serious crimes falling rapidly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. If anyone has doubts about the seriousness of the situation he should look at page 42 of "Criminal Statistics" where he will see an astonishing figure. I may have got it wrong—if so, I hope that the Under-Secretary will correct me. Perhaps the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who is always so clever in statistical matters, will look up page 42. Table 7 shows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sex and age of persons against whom charge proved in alt courts: Analysis by class of crime or offence—All crimes and offences per 1,000 of the population of each age group".</p></blockquote>
If the hon. Member for Garscadden, and others who have his ability and arithmetical skill, look at the third line of the column for age 17 they will find the figure 265.7. That indicates that out of 1,000 in the 17 years male age group there are 265.7 who have at some stage been convicted, or have had a charge proved against them, for a crime or an offence—a ratio of about one in four. That should make us think very seriously indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden looks puzzled and perhaps concerned, but I think that he will accept that that is a staggering figure to be published in Government statistics. Furthermore, the num-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
ber of convictions for those aged 16, 17 and 18 shows a staggering increase in the figures for those convicted at an early age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a desperately serious problem. Crime is increasing savagely, particularly, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire rightly said, among the younger age groups. It is increasing among those aged 16, 17, 18 and 19. Is there anything in the legislation which one can honestly believe will reduce that figure or prevent it from increasing? I am afraid not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, although we welcome tidying-up measures in the legislation, which are useful in correcting some anomalies, we want to change other parts. In Committee we shall put forward a considerable number of amendments. We feel that the Bill is typical of the Government's haphazard and inadequate attitude to what is a desperately serious problem. We make clear now—I say this to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan)—that if a Conservative Government are returned to power, as we hope and expect, after the next General Election, there will then be a Government who will regard the battle against crime as their top priority and not as just another matter to be considered from time to time. We shall bring forward measures to increase deterrence and ensure that we have a genuine battle against crime, and we shall give full support to the police to make sure that we have a fully-manned police force with high morale. We regard this as a matter entrusted to us by the people—to battle against crime and to win.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, that battle is being lost, and we regard the legislation before us as an inadequate and pathetic response to a desperately serious and urgent problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.29 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ought perhaps to make clear that I am still a partner in a Glasgow legal firm which does a certain amount of criminal work. I do not know whether that gives me an interest, but it should be on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hasten to assure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) that there is absolutely no way in which anyone on the Government Benches takes with anything less than seriousness the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
great problem of the growth in the crime rate over the past few years and, indeed, over the past many years. It is something of which we are all well aware and, clearly, law and order and criminal justice will be in the centre of political argument in Scotland for some time to come. None of us would quarrel with that and we would all wish the subject to be a matter for discussion and debate. There is nothing more helpful than informed debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there was some merriment in Committee during the course of the hon. Member's speech, that was due to the speech and not the subject. Perhaps the hon. Member will have to consider the subject more seriously in the months ahead if he is to be taken as a serious contributor to debates on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill. It is a useful measure. It is sensible and reasonable, and most of the provisions are civilised. I say that at the beginning of my speech because I shall be criticising certain portions of it and no doubt in time I shall be suggesting additions to as well as omissions from the Bill as drafted. I want to make it clear that the Bill is, on the whole, a plus. It is undoubtedly a helpful measure and implements a number of extremely useful suggestions that have come up from the documents and investigations that my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate mentioned at the beginning of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Advocate is absolutely right. It is always extremely difficult to strike the right balance. We are constantly under pressure—understandable pressure—from those who want us to do something about the rising crime rate. The difficulty is not that we are unwilling to do something, but, as we would continue to argue—and in this I am sure that we are correct—there is no kind of short cut to success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot abolish crime in the way that the hon. Member for Cathcart appears to think, by jiggling around with sentencing policies in the courts. To lead people to believe that would be mistaken—and unfair. I would not want to see individual liberties and safeguards for the accused in the courts sacrificed in an illusory chase for gains that would merely produce a system that was harsher, more oppressive and, at the end of the day, none the more effective. We are constantly having to do this balancing act, and I congratulate my hon. Friends on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
the Front Bench on having on the whole—and I stress, on the whole—got the balance largely right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to speak at great length. There are so many points that we shall want to take up in Committee and many things that we shall want to look at in detail. But I start by welcoming the provisions on money bail. I think it is an admirable provision that we should get rid of money bail. I agree with the findings of the Thomson committee. Lord Thomson has made the case very fully that there is no evidence at all that the imposition of money bail has any very direct relationship to the likelihood of a particular accused party turning up in court for trial or further process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that hail is one of the areas in which—as anyone who runs a sort of jobbing criminal practice in Scotland knows—there are very striking differences in practice between individual sheriffs within sheriffdoms and certainly between sheriffdoms. I was sitting, for example, in Glasgow sheriff court the other day before one well known Glasgow sheriff who told me—and he has said this from the bench on a number of occasions—that his starting point was £25. On one indictment case where in my view there were very good reasons why bail should have been set at a low level—and on which he accepted that there were very good reasons—he set bail at £40 on the ground that anything less than that would be derisory. But that is a matter of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could certainly name a number of not only individual sheriffs but sheriff courts in the west of Scotland where it is not uncommon to get bail set at £1 in indictment cases if there are special circumstances in which the sheriff is satisfied that, while he has to carry out the letter of the law that bail must be set in indictment cases, he still feels that in effect bail should be as near ordination to appear as is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite these instances to show the enormous differences that there are in individual practices, which can only tend to bring the law into disrepute. I have been aware on many occasions—as any lawyer who appears in custody courts knows—of a man, faced with £10 bail, where the figure has been set as low as that, being carted away to Barlinnie because he does not have that money in his possession. He may be a 17-year-old, none of whose family has bothered to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
turn up, and the result is that he must go through the unfortunate, unpleasant, expensive, time-consuming, prison-cluttering process of reception as an unpaid bail when the imposition of that bail is doing nothing whatsoever for criminal justice or to ensure that the person is likely to attend on a future occasion. I certainly welcome the proposal that that provision should go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My answer to the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) when he asks why we should not keep money bail as an alternative is that I feel that if it were an alternative it would be used. As the Lord Advocate has said, it is not usual to give directions—certainly not tight directions—to sheriffs or judges in Scotland. Without tight directions, to which I think the hon. and learned Gentleman would be the first to object, there will be many sheriffs who would say that it is still on the statute book as an alternative—and it would be an alternative that would become policy on a large number of occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the prison statistics, which have already been referred to, it is astonishing that no fewer than 12,281 men awaiting trial went to prison in Scotland last year. In terms of disruption to family life, the enormous expense to the State, the imposition of prison sentence while there is always a balance, the balance against money bail is an almost overwhelming one. It is expensive, time consuming and ultimately socially disruptive and ineffective. I am glad to see the back of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer briefly to the youth institution, the umbrella term, which will replace the specific sentence to the detention centre, the borstal or to young offenders' institution. I welcome this, although I have some qualifications in mind. It is something we should look at carefully when we meet in Committee. It is perfectly proper to say that a sheriff working hard under pressure with a minimum of information, however carefully he may look at the specific report before him, is not the person best equipped not only to say that the youth concerned will have to go to some kind of custodial regime but to take the decision about which institution is fitted to his temperament, his background and his particular responsibilities. Anything that will give
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
more consideration to that important point is on the right side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an important point which the hon. Member might like to consider. That is that if it is not done by a sheriff, however inappropriate it may be for a sheriff to do it, presumably in his imagination these youth institutions will take different forms. In other words, they will have a blanket name and it will be done by some anonymous official over whom there is no public check.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be done by social workers and by the governors of the receiving institutions. I presume that there will be some social work input in the sense that reports will be available if a youth is being sent to a custodial setting, and presumably there will be consultation with the various governors who will have to work with him, as to whether he is the kind of person who could usefully be sent to an institution. In Committee we shall no doubt learn more about that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Harry Ewing)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should elaborate a little more at this stage. In the adult institutions in Scotland there is a committee of prison officers which allocates adult prisoners to the various institutions. The court does not sentence a man to imprisonment stating that that sentence has to be served in Barlinnie, Perth or Peterhead. That is done internally. Here we are extending that internal system to young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter we shall be looking at, and argument is in favour of the proposed change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be some difficulties for sheriffs who, when regarding sentence, like to say that Glenochle is appropriate because it is the three months' glasshouse treatment, the short, sharp shock. That will be denied them. On the other hand, by saying "three months" presumably they are predisposing the assessment procedure, because obviously with only a three-month sentence one cannot be thinking in terms of a borstal training regime. To some extent, the sheriff, by deciding the length of a sentence, will predetermine the selection process as to institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to argue—in Committee no doubt we shall ventilate this—that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
borstal training, which is an indeterminate sentence, was useful. As the Committee will recognise, the average stay in a borstal is probably nine to 10 months, but there are cases where young men have stayed there from 15 to 18 months depending on their progress and the difficulties of their situation. Presumably, now the Lord Advocate has confirmed this, a determinate sentence—to which, presumably, remission will apply—is the order of the day. Sheriffs may therefore be tempted to increase the lengths of their sentences to allow a margin for error. That is something we shall have to look at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, abolition of the indeterminate sentence will be extremely popular with the clients. That may be disconcerting to the hon. Member for Cathcart, but in my experience of talking to people in this age group, they much prefer to know the maximum they could serve, rather than facing a period of borstal training which, being open-ended, they find disconcerting and unsettling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the hon. Member's attitude that it is the preference of the unfortunate detainee that we should be considering? How does the sheriff decide if he thinks that borstal training will be appropriate? Does he then just give the detainee 18 months, whereas if he thought that detention was appropriate he would give him three months? It is a most unsatisfactory suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is unsatisfactory. The hon. and learned Member has drawn attention—as I am doing—to that difficulty. I am saying that although, on balance, I am in favour of the move, there are specific differences to which the hon. and learned Member refers. I am not suggesting that the views of the accused are the only considera-tioil. I mentioned a number of factors, but that is one factor that, no doubt, will crop up in debate, though possibly it is not an important factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not persist in talking wben in a sedentary position. The hon. Gentleman must wait until the hon. Member gives way before he starts talking. Mr. Dewar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of areas in which Conservative spokesmen constantly talk about the views of the accused. After all, retribution and deterrence, by definition, are solely concerned with the mental attitude of the person who is suffering. To say that that is not something that is a fair matter for comment and debate on criminal justice seems to me a piece of intellectual sophistry that is remarkably blatant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not one to be misunderstood by his constituents or by anyone else. For the record, will he state specifically whether he is seriously suggesting that the views of a convicted—not merely accused—person are a relevant consideration when this Committee is considering appropriate sentence for future legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they are relevant. They should not necessarily be a dominating, controlling, or even a particularly important consideration—but they are certainly a relevant consideration. For example, they are relevant to people who run these institutions. If there are discontented inmates, there could be trouble within the institution. There are many ways in which the reaction of the person being sentenced—for example, as to whether it would encourage him to commit the crime again—would be centrally relevant to all conservative argument on crime and punishment. I am very surprised at the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) taking that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This argument is precisely the argument that the other side used when defending the use of corporal punishment in schools. They said that the pupils preferred it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made one or two points about parts of the Bill of which I approve, I shall briefly turn to clauses 1 and 2, about which I am considerably less happy. That will not come as a surprise to the Lord Advocate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is a great need to help the police. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Cathcart about the percentage of crimes reported to the police which have been cleared up. It is 28.6 per cent in the last year, and 31.5 per
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
cent, in the previous year. It is fair to say that those are alarming figures, more alarming, perhaps, than some of the figures over which the hon. Gentleman does his ritual dances every time a criminal justice debate takes place. Anyone who takes that view must be anxious to ensure that the police have all the proper armoury of powers that will allow them to track down and deal with any crime drawn to their attention. However, there is a balance, and one should not allow police powers to go so far as to erode important liberties of the individual subject who may be under suspicion for a crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that if the police suspect a certain individual of a crime, they should be allowed to take him to a police station and hold him specifically for the purposes of questioning. I do not attempt to know the law on this matter as well as the hon. Member for Kinross and West Perthshire, who is a specialist advocate in criminal work, but 1 think that he will accept that this has very far-reaching implications for the law about the admissibility of evidence, as we know it in Scotland today. It finally kills and buries Chalmers v. Lord Advocate—a judgment in 1954—which, although much eroded, is still, I understand, the basis of the law of Scotland on such matters. It may be that it has been a long time a-dying, but I, at least, would be prepared to mourn its passing if it was to be killed off in this particularly brutal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 29 of the Thomson Committee report there is a persuasive passage from the judgment of the Lord Justice-General, Lord Cooper. I should not like to see that scrapped. It is dangerous to say that the police should be allowed to take someone whom they suspect of a crime to a police station with the specific intention of questioning him. That is an invitation to the police to put pressure on—we are all human—in a situation where pressure should not be put on. That is a dangerous inclusion in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will shelter behind the fact that the Thomson committee recommended that provision. But I ask the Minister to consider seriously that the Thomson committee recommended it as part of a package deal and that package is not on offer to us today. This point is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
fundamental to my attitude. In effect, the Thomson committee said "Let us allow this power, but let us also have a system whereby questioning and statements in police stations are tape-recorded. Let us have a further safeguard that if a statement is made, immediately after the first appearance in court, there should be a judicial examination when the accused may then deny or explain, or put his gloss upon a statement which may be terribly damaging to him if it is left in the state in which the police got it." That was a total package on offer from Lord Thomson. The Ministers have taken one piece of that package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might have been prepared to go along with the total package but, unless my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench are very persuasive, I am not prepared to go along with the power to detain and question in that situation without the rest of the package put forward in Thomson. I know, and I accept, what I think the Lord Advocate will say: that there is a specific inclusion in the Bill to the effect that no questions need be answered. But everyone who tries to live in the real world can see a situation in which a boy of 17 or 18 is taken to a police station and is told that he need not answer questions. But will he then sit for four hours in that police station saying "No" and then repeat that denial thereafter? Is he not in great danger of thinking, that he must say something, and will he not then start talking wildly, as youngsters in such a situation often do? To build that situation into the system is in many ways unfair to the police as it is to the accused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am taking an old-fashioned and somewhat romantic view, but it is an important right of an individual to be able to say to the police "I am sorry. I have not been arrested. I do not want to come to the police station to answer questions. If you want to detain me, arrest me. If you cannot arrest me, I shall go my own way until you have sufficient information from other sources to allow that arrest to be made." We are walking down a dangerous path if we take clause 2 on its own outwith the rest of the Thomson package, as presently has been suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one small further point on page 32 of the Thomson report. The Thomson committee made a recom-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
mendation that if the suggestion were instituted, no "adverse influence" from the refusal to answer questions should be founded upon or referred to in court. I presume that the Lord Advocate or the Under-Secretary of State will be able to assure us that that is the Government's intention in the legislation. As far as I can see, it is not specifically mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there are two brief points I wish to make. I apologise for being so long, Mr. Doig, but it is a fascinating Bill. I agree with the hon. Member for Pent-lands that there is a startling omission at this time: that is the procedure on stated cases. I have had personal experience of trying to persuade a sheriff that certain pieces of evidence which seemed to me to be of absolutely fundamental importance and which had not necessarily even been challenged in the summary trial should be included in his summary of evidence which he accepted for the consideration of the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to make too much of the argument, but anyone who has practised for any time in criminal courts in Scotland has come across cases which have caused widespread concern among those involved because of the firm refusal of a sheriff to give ground on defence amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is too expensive to tape-record trials. I personally accept the Thomson argument that it would be time-consuming to give an unfettered right to a retrial and that it would be used when there was no justification for it. We are in a difficult area. But I should have thought that the very basic minimum would be Lord Thomson's proposal that there should be a hearing if there are defence adjustments not accepted by the sheriff. If at the end of the day he will still not accept them, they at least, should be recorded so that the High Court is aware of the dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would go further and say that in those circumstances it should be possible to petition the High Court for a retrial if it is clear that there has been a head-on collision about the evidence between the sheriff who took the case in the first instance and those advising the appellant. It would not happen often: it would mean that there would be only occasional retrials. As Thomson clearly says, it is a procedure that has worked in England and it is a procedure that worked in Scotland in a trial when there is an argu-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
ment about admissibility. The Lord Advocate should re-examine this procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the Government intended to bring forward amendments dealing with the stated case and the re-trial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I left the Committee momentarily and I did not hear the Lord Advocate say that. Perhaps he will consider my suggestions, but I am relieved to hear that he intends to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final disappointment to me in the Bill—I perhaps take a fairly lonely view—is that it is a great pity that more has not been done about means inquiry procedures and non-payment of fines as a sanction in the courts. This is another area in which an enormous number of people end up in prison who should not end up there. We know that about 43 per cent, of all men who are sentenced to imprisonment—that excludes those who are in prison on remand—are never sentenced initially. The courts do not think that imprisonment is the appropriate disposal when those men are in court, but they sentence themselves by their failure to pay fines. The figure in 1977 was 7,426 people, which is an intolerable burden to place upon an overcrowded prison service. It is also an intolerable burden to place upon social security systems, on families which are disrupted, and upon the taxpayer who has to meet the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average sentence was 42 days; the average served under this class was about two to three weeks. When we recognise that it costs about £67 on average to keep a man in prison for a week we can see that we are talking about very substantial sums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is particularly ludicrous when we consider that of the 161,000 fines imposed in summary courts, 116,000 in 1977 were for sums of under £25. Therefore, these people are being put in prison for very small sums of money. I take the view—I recognise that it will be a minority view—that there is a case for saying that we should look at the abolition of imprisonment as a means of imposing a sanction for the non-payment of fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This refers to the point made earlier in the debate by the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). In 1977–78 the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
amount of fines written off in the sheriff courts was £26,440—a tiny amount of money. I suspect that if we took direct deduction to meet the instalments, if necessary, from benefit—in those circumstances they would be very small instalments—we might find that the figure of £26,000 would hardly increase at all and that we should be collecting almost as much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much welcome the announcement made by the Lord Advocate that experiments involving enforcement officers will be made in Airdrie and in Edinburgh. If there are enforcement officers, civil diligence, and direct deduction we would very nearly reach the point where the seven-day imprisonment for the fine under £25, which are the vast majority of fines in our courts, would then be abolished. We would then have a situation where there would be an enormous reduction in the prison population.

I apologise for speaking too long. I hope that the Committee stage will be constructive—as it often can be on a nonparty, cross-political measure of this kind. It is a good Bill and it will throw up enormous opportunities for improvement—which is a credit to the Bill, not a criticisim of it. The Bill should be welcomed in a much more handsome spirit than the somewhat meagre ration of praise which political prejudice allowed the hon. Member for Cathcart to dole out earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.57 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not give meagre praise to the Bill, but I welcome it. Indeed, it was one of the great disappointments of last Session that we were unable to have this legislation before us for consideration at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was also disappointment about the position of criminal appeals, but that has been partly allayed by the Lord Advocate. However, it has been only partly allayed because we have yet to see what proposals he wishes to put forward, I associate myself with the opinion of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) and the failure of the Government to give effect to the main recommendation of the Emslie Committee Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem we face is the large number of crimes of violence, particu-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
larly murder—certainly from culpable homicide up to murder—and there is nothing in the Bill to deal with the situation. There would be a greater sanction if courts were able to slap on very heavy sentences in those cases where the crime was so horrific that protection of the public warranted the detention of someone for a long period, and well beyond that normally given under the life sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another criticism of the Bill is that there seem to be no new penal changes other than the move to generic sentences. Perhaps we should consider for the future that, instead of receiving a Bill of this size every five, 10 or 15 years or whatever the period is, an annual or one every two years setting out changes in the law of criminal procedure and of penal reform as we progress might be more appropriate and satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tackle the Bill against the statistic which the Lord Advocate mentioned, the fact that we have one of the largest prison populations in Western Europe, and also against the information that the 1977 Criminal Digest statistics show that crimes are up 13.9 per cent. What worries me, because I represent a city constituency, is that when one looks at the figures one finds that 90.7 crimes per thousand are committed in cities, whereas the figures for elsewhere in Scotland the boroughs and rural areas—combined is 42.2 per cent. A large number of the problems facing us arise from city living. Indeed, only the other day my mother was walking along the road with a lady in Glasgow when a youth came along, snatched the bag of her friend, and then ran away into a waiting car. That is just an example of the sort of thing that happens in my own family circle. I know from my constituents that this fear is stated frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leads us to the important role which the police have to play—a role that is not mentioned in this Bill. If police morale and numbers have risen with recent pay increases, that will have a beneficial effect. It is in that area where the Scottish Office has a part to play in over-deployment of the police in making sure that areas of cities in particular are well and properly policed and that, where crimes occur, the police are on the spot very quickly to arrest the persons concerned.

12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome Clause 1 which gives powers of detention of suspects or of witnesses for a short period to obtain information. That is a crucial aspect. It may be part of police practice, but if it helps the "bobby on the beat" to have that information, so much the better. The one proviso I make is that a constable should warn a suspect who is asked to explain himself that his replies may be used in evidence. In that way the suspect will be aware of his legal rights at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the suspect, having heard that warning, does not wish to give an explanation, it would be in order for the police officer concerned to proceed to the next stage under clause 2 in taking the suspect into the police office while other inquiries are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In common with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I have reservations about clause 2. I think it introduces into Scottish law a situation that has not been there before. It allows—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that seventeen Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and seventeen Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard of the importance of leaving the 99 sheep and going in search of the missing one, but when the shepherd himself reduces the quorum, we shall need to consider that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that the clause introduces into the law of Scotland the possibilities of interrogation procedures. I was always very proud of our system of law, and the opportunities for interrogation by the police seemed to be so much less than was the case in England. I know that the Government have reduced the period recommended by the Thomson Committee from six to four hours with the intention of allaying the fears of members of the Committee, but I am still worried on the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that the new computer systems, to which the police have access, are quickly able to cross-check information—names, addresses and so on—and I am not so sure that there is the same requirement for such a long period of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
time as has been set out in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is a need for suspects to be kept in a police office for a period of time. In my opinion, about two hours should be adequate for the purpose, but I would consider an additional arrangement in the package—not quite what the hon. Member for Garscadden quoted from the Thomson report—namely, that the police should perhaps be given the right in the street to search suspects for weapons. Many people have fears about the increase in the kind of weapons carried by criminals and the damage they can inflict. I have had experience in the courts involving cases in which boys carrying weapons have been caught up in gang warfare. Such boys did not intend to use the weapons, but they did so, and found themselves involved in serious assaults which otherwise would not have occurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did they take them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman makes a good point. But it is equally right to suggest that the police should have a right to search in the street if they have reason to suspect that a weapon is being carried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious point. People who carry weapons do not in theory intend to use them. But a person without a knife in certain areas and ethoses is similar to a Scotsman who wears a kilt without a skean-dhu. He would be improperly dressed. That is why people take weapons with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear the hon. and learned Gentlemans experience. I do not think that we should go back to the times when a dirk was obligatory dress. Anything we can do by altering the Bill to give additional powers to the police could be helpful. I should be glad if the Lord Advocate could answer the question whether the police have power to search suspects on the streets for drugs, although we know that they do not have the power to search for weapons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to say much more about clause 2, but I have certain reservations about it. Subsection (5)(	<i>a</i>) refers to conditions when the police may search in the police office. There is no mention of corroboration, but I hope that the Lord Advocate will perhaps confirm that that is an essential part of the proceedings for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
the purpose of court appearances thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A strong welcome should be given to the provision for those who have been detained for being drunk and incapable. My worry is about the timescale under which the facilities will be provided. Interestingly enough, there is no reference to treatment in the clause as drafted, although reference is made in the explanatory notes to detoxification. If one reads the explanatory notes and the Bill together, presumably the intention is that detoxification facilities will be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One difficulty is what happens when somebody who is drunk is taken by the police to such a unit and, while left there, decides to leave. Is that a situation which would found a prosecution? What time-scale is suggested for the period during which the drunk should be expected to remain in the detoxification unit? There is a practical problem there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like, too, to have an assurance about the amount of resources to be provided to local authorities for provision of the suggested facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to a relatively minor point on clauses 5 and 6—accused persons being released on conditions of bail. It has always struck me as strange that, when somebody is released on bail on a summary complaint, the press have access to the address of that person and it can be splashed all over the newspapers, whereas somebody who is accused of a more serious crime and appears on petition finds that, when bail is given, the domicile citation is given as the sheriff clerk's office and the person is treated more or less anonymously. Both classes of offender should be treated in the same way, and it is certainly a nonsense that the person who is accused of a more serious offence is excused the damaging consequences of interim bad publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 7 reference is made to the penalty of £200 or imprisonment which can be imposed if the accused fails to appear for the diet or trial. I am not sure that the penalty is adequate. I think that it is adequate for the vast majority of cases, but from time to time there can be very complex trials with a large number of accused and a ferocious number of witnesses, when other considerations may apply. In view of the gravity of the offence, an accused may decide not to return for trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
At that stage a lot of expense has been caused to the State, and more would be caused by the postponement of the trial. The State might even be involved in extradition proceedings. If the accused person is subsequently brought back for trial, it seems to me that in those circumstances the sanction of £200 or a limited period of imprisonment would be an inadequate penalty. I think that the Government should consider the alternative of a breach of bail being treated on indictment, if that were considered desirable from the point of view of the Lord Advocate, leaving the actual sentence to the judge who hears the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On clause 47, I am not sure whether I agree with the arrangements that have been made for part suspended sentences. I think it is a good idea to bring in suspension of sentences so that the threat will hang over a person and perhaps condition that person to be of better behaviour. It means that the person would not go to prison—a saving of public resources—and by not getting involved in further criminal activity in the meantime would benefit society as well as the person himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suspended sentence does not mean that the offender would not go to prison. He could go to prison for part of the sentence and the other part would be held in suspense on condition of his good behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but as I read the clause, there would be no question of suspending the whole sentence—merely a part. We may have the situation where somebody is thrust into prison as a lesson and, having been allowed out on suspended sentence, he knows what it is about and is less likely to be involved in trouble. That is an arguable proposition. But it is also arguable that the court should be able to suspend the whole sentence and not bring somebody into a custodial institution, which may have an adverse effect on that person's character and background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thinking also of somebody who has employment and who requires to be dealt with by way of a sentence of imprisonment. If that sentence is suspended, the person saves his job, and, with the threat hanging over his head, both he and society may benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should consider sus-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
pension of the whole sentence, leaving to the courts the possibility, as provided in the clause, of suspension of part of the sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other points which J should like to make. It promises to be an extremely interesting Committee. I can see certain members with legal backgrounds queuing up for consideration for membership of the Committee, which is not a usual state of affairs among Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden said that there will be a considerable amount of cross-party voting, but I should not like to regard it as cross-party. On a Bill of this kind, which is essentially non-political, I should like us to consider each provision and decide whether it is satisfactory as it stands, what changes should be made and judge it according to our own background, experience and what we consider is good for our constituents and our country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.12 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that there will be many hon. Members with a legal background queuing up to take part in the Committee. We have heard about little but deterrents this morning, and one of the deterrents to speaking is that if one speaks one is liable to be put on the Committee. That seems a much more effective deterrent than bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are suffering from myths. One of the myths is that when we introduce a Criminal Justice Bill we have dealt with crime. It is a myth perpetuated by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). Because it does not answer his atavistic attitude towards the abolition of crime, there is something wrong with the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. The point of a Criminal Justice Bill, among other things, is that it recognises the existence of crime and sets out ways to cope with people who are involved in crime. But it cannot do much more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with the hon. Member for Cathcart first, because his is the lightest of the arguments with which we have to deal. He always reminds me of a mixture of "Some Mothers Do Have Them", Houdini and King Lear. As in "Some Mothers Do Have Them", he creates a path of havoc in the area of sense and reason. He then slips out of it by going on to the attack as soon as he is chal-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
lenged on his figures and, like King Lear, when asked for policies he says
	<br><blockquote><p>"I will do such things—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>What they are yet I know not—but they shall be the terrors of the earth."</p></blockquote>
We can dismiss most of what he had to say today, but there was an important myth behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We published a detailed policy statement setting out a specific programme for action on crime. It is called "Onward to Victory", and copies are available from the Conservative Central Office. We have also published another document called "Crime and its Remedies".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every time we ask the hon. Gentleman what actions he would propose we get the answer "They shall be savage." But we are never told what they are. He reflects an important attitude in society which says that crime is a bad thing and that crime should be stopped—we all agree on that—but it should not be assumed that those who want seriously to deal with the question, particularly with those who are involved in crime, are somehow in favour of crime. The reason that some of us reject such atavistic demands as come from the hon. Gentleman is that we do not believe they will solve the problem of crime. This goes a great deal deeper than mere response in the form of repression, hardship and savagery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried at present when, for example, I see so much lack of questioning in the press on the use of guns at the weekend. I want to know a great deal more about what is now going on in the police force and about the instructions and guidelines on the use of guns. I say this because, when people such as the hon. Member for Cathcart try to create a political career out of rising fears, it is very easy for those of us who try to take a more sensible attitude to be pushed in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being most unfair. He is also being, for him, most unrealistic. If he and any of his hon. Friends go back to their constituencies to ask their constituents if they are worried about the increase in crime and ask them what they want done about it, nobody will make any suggestions that are in the Bill. My hon.

Friend is absolutely right to draw attention to this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what the Bill does. Of course, we are anxious and concerned about crime. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have argument across the Floor. That applies to all—to the Minister, to the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) and to everyone else. The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has the Floor, and if he does not give way I must stop this argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is doing himself less than justice. Because he appears to show such concern when the police are issued with arms in order to deal with armed men and no concern about the men who arm themselves in the first place, it seems that he takes an imbalanced view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 should inform my hon. Friend of what caused the altercation between the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) and myself. It stemmed from an intervention by the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray), who suggested that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the most complicated intervention I have ever heard. I have to deal with the response made by the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) on behalf of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor), and replied to by the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the hon. Minister's fault that he gives way and is faced by this situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a model of goodness and sense in all this. It is an illustration of the situation which Members get into when they are intent to develop a non-reasoning attitude towards crime as a substitute for reason. This is what has happened. I am concerned that through-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
out our State structures there is an eroding of the liberties of the subject. I am therefore concerned also that our fellow citizens should be prevented from harm at the hand of those criminal elements who have already rejected the State structures. But to the extent that I detest the outbreak of mugging, youth violence and everything else, I am also disturbed when the State itself finds it too easy to use violence as a response. That is why I am concerned when I see such things as the discussion about the cages in Inverness or the use of guns that we find becoming, apparently, much more common in the police force. We have to be aware of that too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak as somebody who has been mugged. It was a frightening and unpleasant experience. I understand the fear that old people especially have. But it does them no good to suggest that there is an easy remedy and that the remedy is a harsh, repressive deterrent. I say that because there is absolutely no proof that that kind of deterrence ever works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no proof, and I repeat that. It is not enough for the hon. Member to reply "Rubbish". There is no proof that that kind of deterrent is ever effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's arguments are very sincere, precise and carefully thought out but everybody else's are rubbish. May I ask him just one thing? He has said that there is no evidence on deterrence. What is his assessment of the facts? We had a serious outbreak of razor-slashing in Glasgow. It stopped after Lord Garment imposed a number of serious sentences. Could the hon. Gentleman also explain why there was no general change in the number of killings in Scotland between 1945 and 1965 and why, since then, there has been a dramatic increase?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer that question. In the first place, the myth of the sharp increase of sentences at the time of Lord Carment dealing with violence and of declining sentences afterwards producing violence is wrong. Sentencing increased throughout the period when violence was continuing to rise. Whatever else may have been said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
about the Lord Carment era, it did not stop violence. Nor was it an isolated case of an increase of sentencing, because the length of sentences increased later when there was an increase in violence concurrently. That is what I mean by myth creation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two aspects of the Bill which I want to discuss. One is the detention proposals and the other is clause 37 relating to young offenders—one of which I welcome and one about which I am anxious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the Thomson report and the discussion that has gone on over the years, there is a tendency to say I see it repeated by people such as Sir Robert Mark and Commissioner McNee—that because the police feel they have to take certain measures to cope with the problems we should therefore legalise those measures; that since the police have felt that they must use irregular methods to deal with the problem, we should regularise them and that will be the solution. This is part of the same erosion of liberties. Undoubtedly, one problem we face in our cities is the extension of this business of "sus"—the question of suspicion. It has, for example, led London to a good deal of breakdown in relationships between young people and the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not one who thinks that the public attitude to sentences and to accused persons should not be considered. On the contrary, I think that the response of the bulk of people towards police practice must be taken into account. It has to be the right action. There are many people involved with young people who will tell us of the relative—though not total—breakdown of relationships between police and young people, relationships which a number of good police officers have tried to build up. If that happens, it will not help the prevention of crime. It will make crime more likely and more easy. They are, of course, afraid of search and afraid of being in a police station under such a system as has now been suggested—and, incidentally, without the safeguards suggested in Chapters 7 and 8 of the Thomson report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first place, I reject the proposition that we should legalise that which might have been done irregularly. Second, I reject it the more because the safeguards in relation to taking statements and so on are not included. This is a dangerous path for us to tread. It is no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
help to create a feeling of opposition between our police, the forces of law and order, and young people, any more than it is an answer to the rise in violence if the State itself participates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is about the attitudes of the accused and the condemned and our attitude towards them. The discussion between the Opposition and my hon. Friend for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) was interesting. It meant that we have rejected the reformatory rehabilitation role of our prison institutions. In saying that the attitude and response to those who are condemned to enter an institution should not be considered, by definition we are rejecting any reformatory rehabilitation role for such institutions. That is disastrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome strongly the provisions regarding young offenders, subject to the caveat mentioned by my hon. Friend, on which I may have a word to say if I am fortunate enough to be on the Committee. The justification is obvious. If we are to accept that our institutions must play some kind of reformatory or rehabilitation role, it is important to tailor our institutions for the needs of our young offenders. What happens now is that a sheriff, inadequately briefed—and, incidentally, inadequately trained for the task—decides on the kind of treatment that they should have. I believe that this is quite wrong. Already there is an executive interference in it in the form of the committee described by the Under-Secretary, which tries to temper what is done. That is no more than recognising that this should be removed from the sheriff altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We require a flexible series of institutions. I recognise that there must be some where there is a highly disciplined regime. But others, the very opposite of that, may be the proper place for youngsters who need more care and more affection than, perhaps, a harsh disciplined regime would supply. But unless we leave that to the executive and to those who are involved in the day-to-day handling of these matters, we shall not get the right judgments made. Therefore, I absolutely approve of what is proposed. It is the first step forward to letting us have a range of institutions within which, perhaps, the offender can move from one to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem arises of the indeterminate sentence. In fact, I completely agree
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
with my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, that people prefer to know what they are getting. Perhaps we shall have to look again at the whole question of remission and parole for our young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore a curate's egg welcome that I give to the Bill. I hope that the Committee discussions will wear down some of the myths that have been created—above all the myth that we can deal with the rise in violence merely by reiterating that there is a rise in violence, by reiterating the statistics and suggesting that there is an easy way out. There is no short cut here. The idea of a short cut will give satisfaction to the hon. Member for Cathcart—it may even give him political benefit—but it will do very little for the good of our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.27 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo what the Lord Advocate said when he opened the debate. It has taken us a long time to get this Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) said the same. It is one of the tragedies of our legislative programme in the House of Commons, and perhaps it is indicative of the pressures under which Scottish legislation, that despite the plethora—if I may use the word—of reports, recommendations and so on, actually to carry those reports through to a conclusion in action often takes too long and is often so much delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a pity not only in the sense of delay in carrying forward recommendations for action which, one hopes, is beneficial to life in Scodand but also in a negative sense in that it indicates how we lose opportunities in Scotland to make innovations and experiment. I believe that the size of Scotland and its population and the way in which our communities are built up give greater scope for innovation and for experiment than there is, perhaps, south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in commenting on what the Lord Advocate said about how rarely we have these Bills, I must say that I hope that this will be looked at more closely in the future, because we should be more courageous and be prepared to take risks with innovation and experiment. I believe that we can carry out such experiments better in Scotland. If they are not successful, we can perhaps more easily bring
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
them to an end or try to change them in one way or another. Therefore it is a tragedy if, because of lack of legislative time, we deny ourselves the opportunity which should be there for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart, I welcome the Bill and the general good things that it does, but like him, too, I think that we should be wrong to delude ourselves or the Scottish public into thinking that it does anything desperately startling, good as many of the points in it are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now mention two aspects of the Bill about which I feel fairly strongly, both of which I strongly support. The first is that mentioned by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), in relation -to the offenders between the ages of 16 and 21. This illustrates how long it takes us to do anything—a report published in November 1969, legislation introduced in November 1978, nine years afterwards, and not being passed into law until nearly 10 years have passed since the original report. Despite whatever discussions may have taken place on the report, the legislation is almost exactly based on the recommendations of that report, which only illustrates what I was saying a moment earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the report to be a good one. It is a pity that it was not legislated upon earlier. It is good in two senses, as the Lord Advocate rightly said. It makes for better utilisation of our resources in terms of the institutions we have for younger offenders, and second, I hope that within our institutions it means we can introduce a wider range of treatment that is more appropriate to the particular type of offender than is possible under the existing system with its distinct demarcation lines of young offenders institution, detention centre and borstal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four questions I have to ask which I hope the Under-Secretary will answer when he winds up. If we are to move on to the new system, we must be assured that we have a proper system of assessment with regard to young offenders. We already have that in relation to prison and in relation to borstal—there is a range of different types of borstal—but for the young offenders institution or a detention centre there is not that form of assessment because it is the court that passes the sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be certain therefore that there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
will be an extension of assessment facilities for young offenders if the allocation of the offender is to be successful. I hope that we shall hear exactly what assessment facilities will be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, I return to a point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Gars-cadden (Mr. Dewar). One of the effects of this legislation is that now all sentences for young offenders will be determinate, at least for those being held under Her Majesty's pleasure. At present, both in borstal and in detention, the sentence is left to a specific institution. As the hon. Member for Garscadden acknowledged, the time spent in borstal varies from year to year in accordance with what is estimated by those who run the borstal to be the correct period. In a detention centre, I think I am right in saying that it is for three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With a determinate sentence, some flexibility is removed from the system as it is at present, particularly in relation to borstal where the length of sentence served is directly related to what is regarded as best suited to the needs of those in borstal at present. Therefore, in gaining one form of flexibility we may be losing another, and we should like to know how the introduction of determinate sentences for all young offenders will affect the regime. It could reduce flexibility for the second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Related to that, where precisely will the detention be? A detention centre is the one form of institution which gives the short sharp sentence to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart referred. It is most important that we do not lose the detention centre, the whole purpose of that sentence being that it is short and sharp. Moreover, the way in which the detention system has been built up, the sentence being made short and sharp, has allowed only for those who have not committed an offence before—the first offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the detention centre is for a short, sharp deterrent effect. Having visited my local detention centre and seen what is done there, I regard it as an important and useful part of our penal system. But I am concerned that it is effective only when it is short and sharp—when it is for three months. If someone thought appropriate for that kind of sentence is then sentenced for nine months or a year, under the new system Where does the detention centre fit into
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
the scheme? It would be a tragedy if wc lost that as a result of the change, which in all other respects is one that I welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the matter of optimum sentence. In all cases there is an optimum sentence. We are trying to deal with individuals, particularly with younger offenders, and to prevent recidivism among them. When the Under-Secretary winds up, will he say what scope there will be under the different treatment systems, where there is a determinate sentence, to make sure that the individual serves the optimum sentence in relation to the particular type of regime? This illustrates what I said in relation to the different kinds of institution—detention, borstal and so on. There would be a different optimum sentence in relation to the different kinds of institution. I hope that we do not lose some of the flexibility we have at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the objectives of the present system is to avoid contamination of young offenders by those who have offended already. I mentioned this in the context of the detention centre used only for those serving their first period of detention and not for those who had already been in borstal. That is a sensible objective. It is important as regards prison but it is much more important for young offenders. Under the proposed new legislation, how do the Government think we can avoid the contamination of the first offender by those serving a second or third period of sentence? It is important that the Bill should take care of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of alcohol and alcoholism and the new proposals in the Bill. There is a close link between alcoholism and crime. Anyone who works in this area is well aware of that. At the same time, we must bear in mind that in Scotland there are about five times as many alcohol-related offences as there are in England and Wales. That should give us great concern. I recently read a report of a conference on alcoholism in which the convener of the social work committee of the Strathclyde regional council said that in about 80 per cent, of social work cases some 90 per cent, of children in care have a problem in their family background related to alcohol. Therefore there can be no question of the problem of alcohol being related to crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my own constituency in the Royal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
Manor hospital at Montrose there is the area alcoholism unit. I was interested to find that of the admissions to that unit some 19 per cent, have committed a road traffic offence of some sort or other and about 39 per cent, have committed another form of offence. This again illustrates that where there are problems of alcoholism we often find crime, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I welcome the Lord Advocate's lip-service to a comprehensive approach on the problems of alcohol, he went on to qualify it by saying "This will take time. Facilities cannot be developed quickly." That may be true, but I wonder whether the Government are treating the problem of alcoholism with sufficient urgency and seriousness in the Bill. I welcome the proposals, but in the administrative action that has to follow the Bill's enactment are the Government doing enough to make it worthwhile?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the proposals on alcohol little more than a cosmetic? Are they getting down to the root of the problem? I was referred back by a doctor who has to deal with such problems to the Habitual Drunkards Act 1879, passed 99 years ago. The Bill we are discussing will come into law next year—100 years after that Act. Yet section 6 of the Habitual Drunkards Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The local authority may, subject to any conditions which such local authority shall deem fit, grant to any person … to keep a retreat."</p></blockquote>
All the facilities are set out in that Act to provide the exact kind of centre which the present Bill seeks to set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the best will in the world, where have we been for the past 100 years? We are trying to do what our predecessors 100 years ago did in a different way and in different circumstances. We are still talking about the problem. We still do not have the answers. We are still having to deal with a rising crime rate. We still have to deal with more and more crimes related to alcohol. Therefore, I wonder whether we are dealing with the problem as effectively or as comprehensively as the Lord Advocate tried to make out in his speech this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our proposals on the alcohol problem, are we simply legislating the end we should like to see—to remove the drunks from prison and deal with them in a more constructive and better way—without providing the means required to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
do that? Let us look at the question of cost. In the financial memorandum the Government mention a figure of £100,000 a year as being necessary to help local authorities not just in relation to alcoholism but also in relation to those who may go to a local authority hostel from prison or during a period of suspended sentence and so on. In the context of alcoholism, can one say that that is an adequate amount?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take, for example, the two experimental detoxification units which I hope will be included in any approach to the problem of alcoholism. I asked a Question of the Secretary of State for Social Services and received a Written Answer yesterday. The Committee probably knows that two centres were set up in England: one in Leeds run by a voluntary organisation, and the other in Manchester as part of a hospital. I asked about the cost of these units. The Written Answer said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Leeds unit was established at an estimated capital cost of some £120,000; the associated running costs for the three-year experimental period from May 1976 are expected to be of the order of £500,000. The corresponding figures for the Manchester unit are estimated at £350,000"—</p></blockquote>
that is, capital costs—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and £525,000 for three years from November 1977."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11th December 1978; Vol. 960, c. 72–3.]</p></blockquote>
In trying to get to some of the roots of the problem of alcoholism and crime the Government propose to allocate £100,000 a year for purposes even beyond those of alcohol itself. Are we simply legislating the end without providing the financial means to carry it through to a successful conclusion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three questions on alcoholism which I should like the Minister to answer. First, what power will there be—I do not see it in the Bill—to detain a person who is drunk and has been apprehended by the police and who would normally have been put into the police station and perhaps ended up in prison? Clause 4 seeks to give the police power simply to take a drunk to a designated place but not to detain him. This is an important point and I should like the Minister to enlarge upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that alcoholism cannot be cured on a compulsory basis. There must be the voluntary will for an alcoholic to be cured before successful treatment can take place. We should look at the situa-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
tion in other countries. For example, I understand that in New Zealand there can be compulsory orders for a drunk person to be detained. Perhaps the Minister can say something about experience in other countries. I understand that, by contrast, under the revision of the Mental Health Act taking place in England and Wales, it is being specifically recommended that alcoholism should not be a reason for detaining a person. We have those two contrasting, contradictory approaches to the problem. I think that there is a deficiency in the Bill here and we should look a little further as to whether there should be the power to detain for a limited period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having talked to those in the medical profession who have to deal with problems of alcoholism, I know that some of them would argue that there is some benefit in the short period of detention, since in that period one can often introduce something of a will into the person so that he may subsequently accept voluntary treatment. If people are simply going in and coming out again, all one is providing is a roof over their heads for a short period without any greater progress. I hope that we may have more clarification on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question on alcoholism is whether the Minister can tell us precisely what is a designated place under clause 4 to which a person can be taken. We should like to know more about that, as would those who deal with the problems of alcoholism. As I said before, I have a feeling that the Bill will simply be cosmetic if we are not careful. All we are dealing with is another first-aid problem instead of trying to get through to the difficulties. To put it in the terms used by those to whom I have spoken, we are in danger of creating a revolving-door situation—push them in at one end, they go round, and they come out again, back committing offences a day or so later, or the following week. They then get a social security payment, are pushed through the door again, and so it continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that we must have a much more comprehensive approach. We must, for example, have more done by way of advice and more done by way of homes for those who are habitual drunkards. We have had this in the "Skid Row" type of situation in centres such as the Grassmarket in Edinburgh and else-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
where. We must look at detoxification units of the kind in Leeds and in Manchester. We must also look at the problem of rehabilitation and, beyond that, to the problem of someone who has received medical treatment, or whatever he needs, and the halfway house to try to get them back into the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is what the Lord Advocate means when he says that we want a comprehensive approach. That is what is necessary, certainly in the view of those who have to deal with drunkenness. It is not in the Bill, and we want to know a great deal more before passing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, we must have a great deal more co-operation between the different people who have to deal with the alcoholism problem. I understand from those who have visited the detoxification centre in Manchester that one of the problems is that police do not deliver the drunks to that centre. It takes them about one-and-a-half hours' detour in a police van to do so. I am advised that there is not the co-operation that there might be between that unit and the police, despite the public money that the unit is costing. It is important that we have co-operation between those running the local authority social work departments, the police who first have to deal with the problem and the Health Service and the doctors as regards medical treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, let us not forget the role of the voluntary organisations. I read recently with interest a report of a conference on alcoholism held by the Scottish Council on Alcoholism in May 1978. I read that Captain Hart of the Salvation Army runs a successful detoxification unit in Greenock which is regarded as one of the best in the United Kingdom. I think that the cost per person per week is about £32—half the cost of keeping a person in prison. Where there is this voluntary element sharing in the scheme, the rate of success in guiding people towards medical treatment and towards rehabilitation can 'be extremely high—and in some ways more effective than that done by statutory organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The unit at Leeds is run by a voluntary organisation. I do not say this to point any contrast between the voluntary nature of one and the fact that the other is run under the National Health Service, but I gather that the unit at Leeds is in some respects better situated geographically in relation to the areas with the problem—it is situated in the community—whereas the unit in Manchester is not because it is based in a hospital. I gather that the voluntary unit in Leeds has a much higher throughput, and I understand that it is regarded as rather more effective—but not because one is run one way and the other is run in another way. I repeat that we must look for much greater co-operation among those involved, whatever service they represent, including the voluntary organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I welcome the Bill but I am left with a great fear about what is to happen regarding young offenders and about its effectiveness in relation to alcoholism and the way we deal with drunks. Good as these proposals are on the surface, do we intend to follow them through or, having passed the legislation in Parliament, do we simply wash our hands without providing the means to carry it all through to a successful conclusion? I hope that the Government will give an answer and an assurance when they wind up the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.50 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom McMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that Committee will accept my apologies for being very late. It was completely unavoidable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read through the Bill as much as possible. I have looked hard at how it will help to deal with the gang warfare that is taking place at this minute in Glasgow and has been going on for two years in an area with a population of 80,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been involved personally with elderly people saying to me "Do something, Mr. McMillan. Phone the police." I did that. Nothing happened. I did it again. Nothing happened. A sergeant was sent up to look after them and while he was talking to them there was a battle in the street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing here to help elderly people and ordinary people who are experiencing fear and alarm in their homes at this minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main points that worry me are on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
police powers of detention. That sends a shiver up my spine, based on 45 years' experience in Glasgow. There will not be a civilian element within this. Many members of the committee know that to be so. We need only think of Craig and Bentley—no civilian witnesses. In another recent case in England, no civilian witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the institutions and the set-up to have civilian witnesses during the interrogation. In the Glasgow region we have about 500 justices of the peace. We have councillors. We have people who can ensure that the third degree is not born out of this. With no civilian witnesses or, indeed, no civilian element at all, the third degree could be a distinct possibility. I am not talking about lawyers. We have the organisations to have rosters at places where people are likely to be detained for at least four hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With what has happened recently in England, I am sure that the police themselves would welcome a civilian element in this to keep them right, because taking someone's freedom for four or six hours, questioning him, even though he has been warned that he need only give his name and address, can be frightening in the extreme for a poor soul who does not understand his position, especially if he is to be subjected to interrogation by interrogation experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect I dislike within the Bill is the way in which the person being taken in is looked at. Very often, the telescope is facing the wrong way. This is the one area that has no presumption of innocence, when the interrogation starts. This is the only area in law where democracy does not really work. I believe that the introduction of a civilian element would take away a great many of the worries I have on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no provision in the Bill for the man who has been picked up at his home, taken some miles away, kept for four hours and is then put out—but to where? He may have to go through the worst areas of the country. No provision has been made for transport for him. He might be mugged—and in certain areas of Glasgow he will certainly be mugged at three, four or five in the morning passing through areas I would not pass through. There is no provision that I can see for the safety and security of the person taken for questioning and then released. I think that is very wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main part of the Bill to which I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
object is the part relating to bail. I never worried about the amount of money for bail. As a magistrate, I was always faced with the problem, come the Glasgow fair, that a bloke could not find a pound and he might end up with four weeks in Barlinnie. That was the problem I faced, though it was not a great problem if there was some compassion. But the tendency in bail in Scotland today is different. We have one three years on bail, two at Cumbernauld 18 months on bail, and I believe that there is one approaching a fourth year on bail. It is worthwhile for people to look at this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know my right hon. and learned Friend's view and it coincides with Thomson's view—that bail should not exceed 12 months. If a case cannot be prepared within 12 months, it should be dropped. There is no doubt about that. I was reading about a case the other day in 	<i>The Guardian</i> in an article headed "Justice delayed is justice denied ". I know that my right hon. and learned Friend holds that view, too, because I took it up with him on a specific case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole question of bail and people out on bail has not been properly gone into. An experience in a recent case will possibly remain with me all my life. It concerned a young man who was put on bail. His house is ruined, he cannot find employment, his health is ruined, he lives a completely abnormal life, harassed and hiding from everything that made up his domestic happiness. The man was shattered. A visit by a policeman coming to his door for a parking ticket took on terrifying proportions. Things reached such a state that his attitude was that the establishment was after him. I wish that it were possible to show the change in this man's health and outlook because of two years under the tyranny of bail. I am not mentioning the money involved. That is not important at all. In society that man has to live under those conditions. These cases—one of 18 months at Cumbernauld and another that is over three years—are absolutely against justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

raises an important matter, but clause 20 gives a complete explanation of the point.
