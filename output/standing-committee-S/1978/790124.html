	<br><q><p>That the Committee have considered the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Norway) (No. 2) Order 1978.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if with this we were to take the following:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Malawi) Order 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft Double Taxation Relief (Shipping and Air Transport Profits) (Jordan) Order 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Luxembourg) Order 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft Double Taxation Relief (Shipping and Air Transport Profits) (Venezuela) Order 1978.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could first say something about the orders relating to Luxembourg, Norway and Malawi, because they fall together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These three protocols are primarily concerned with amending the tax treatment of dividends to take account of the imputation system of company taxation which was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1973. They also make minor amendments to some of the other provisions of the existing comprehensive conventions with those countries—the convention with Luxembourg was signed in 1967, the convention with Norway was signed in 1969 and the agreement with Malawi was signed in 1955 and was amended in 1968. I do not propose to give a detailed summary of all the provisions of these orders, but I should like to expand a little on the important question of the tax treatment of dividends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing first of all with dividends flowing from the United Kingdom, the treatment afforded to them by the orders relating to Luxembourg and Norway follows that approved by the House first in the proposed new double taxation convention with the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
United States and since then in a protocol with the Netherlands and a revised convention with Switzerland. A tax credit in respect of dividends paid by a United Kingdom company will be given to portfolio investors in Luxembourg and Norway by which I mean individuals who are resident there and companies resident there which control less than 10 per cent, of the voting power in the United Kingdom company which pays the dividend. The tax credit is of the same amount as that given to individuals resident in the United Kingdom but is subject to a deduction at source of 15 per cent, of the combined value of the dividend and the tax credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of dividends paid to Luxembourg and Norwegian direct investors— that is, Luxembourg and Norwegian resident companies which control at least 10 per cent, of the voting power of the United Kingdom company paying the dividend—a tax credit will also be paid. In this case, however, the tax credit will be half that payable to portfolio investors, subject to a deduction of 5 per cent, of the combined value of the dividend and the tax credit. In the order relating to Malawi the tax credit on United Kingdom dividends will be given only to portfolio investors and then only to those who are subject to tax on such dividends in Malawi.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in respect of dividends flowing to the United Kingdom reflect the differences between the company tax system in the United Kingdom and the systems in Luxembourg, Norway and Malawi. The dividends article in the protocol with Luxembourg provides that the withholding tax levied on direct dividends—that is, dividends paid to a company resident in the United Kingdom which controls at least 25 per cent, of the voting power in the company paying the dividend—is limited to 5 per cent. The rate of withholding tax on other dividends is limited to 15 per cent. Norway has a system under which dividends are deductible from profits for national tax purposes, but not for local taxes. This results in a "split rate" system, in which distributed profits are taxed at a lower rate than retained profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dividends article in the protocol with Norway provides that the withholding tax levied on dividends paid to direct investors is limited to 10 per cent., so long as Norway continues to tax distributed profits at a lower rate than undistributed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
profits. If Norway withdraws the lower rate from her tax system, the withholding tax on direct dividends flowing to the United Kingdom will be reduced to 5 per cent. A similar provision was made in the protocol with Austria which was approved by the House in April. The rate of Norwegian withholding tax on dividends paid to United Kingdom portfolio investors is limited to 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dividends article in the supplementary agreement with Malawi continues the provisions in the existing agreement which prevent Malawi charging any tax on dividends paid to United Kingdom residents who are subject to tax on such dividends in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Norway, the Committee will recall that last July it considered a protocol which provides special rules for the avoidance of double taxation in respect of North Sea exploration and development activities. I take this opportunity therefore to tell the Committee that I hope soon to be able to seek its approval to the terms of a further protocol relating to the North Sea, providing rules to govern the allocation of taxing rights between Norway and the United Kingdom of production profits from transmedian line oil fields—that is, fields that straddle the median line of the continental shelf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These rules would apply, for example, to the Statfjord field and they will be brought before the Committee when the draft protocol applying these rules to the Statfjord field is ready so that both protocols can be taken together. I mention this now so that the Committee will know of the progress the two Governments are making in solving the complex double tax problems arising from the development of the continental shelf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the orders relating to Jordan and Venezuela are the first double taxation agreements which the United Kingdom has concluded with either of these countries. They are broadly in line with other agreements we have concluded. They essentially provide that the income, profits and capital gains derived by an undertaking of one of the countries from the operation of ships or aircraft in traffic between the two countries will be exempt from tax in the other country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders before the Committee today are fair and properly balanced, and I commend them as such to the Committee. The Norwegian order has already been approved by the Norwegian Parliament.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
If there are any particular points any hon. Member wishes to raise, I will do my best to answer him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.36 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister of State on the lucid and succinct way in which he summarised these rather complicated orders and also express our gratitude to him for giving us advance notice of the protocol which Her Majesty's Government are negotiating with regard to transmedian line profits between Norway and the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee welcome in principle any double taxation orders, but it is necessary for us to probe them in a little more detail so that those who are foolhardy enough to follow our debates on these rather complex and technical matters realise that we have discharged our duty and also so that any points of ambiguity may be cleared up here in advance rather than be productive of litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I wish to raise a point of principle. I have never entirely understood why direct investors in the countries concerned should be treated less generously than portfolio investors. I know that this is also to be found in other double tax conventions that the House has approved in the past, but it would be helpful if the Minister would explain why, in the negotiations, he has not safeguarded more rigorously the position of direct investors. One would have thought that countries such as Malawi, in particular, should receive greater encouragement than portfolio investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those general observations, I turn to the orders in particular. I begin with the Norway No. 2 order. I confess total ignorance of the Norwegian tax system, except that I believe that it has a wealth tax—not that I introduce that to encourage hon. Gentlemen opposite to take a hand in the debate and enlarge its ambit. But what are the national and municipal taxes on capital in Norway which are to be covered by the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I note that perhaps for the first time dividends are equated with anything and are defined as distributions under the United Kingdom domestic code. I welcome that and I wonder why the Government should have taken so long to have brought it in. Does not the Minister think that that definition should be extended and reproduced in all double tax
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
conventions, particularly those introduced as a result of the imputation system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that, under article III, interest is to be treated as including anything treated as interest. Are we to assume, therefore, that that excludes interest which, under our rather complicated deeming provisions—I have in mind section 233 of the 1970 Act—is treated as a distribution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to article IV. I apologise to the Committee for dealing with these points in great detail, but they may turn out to be of some significance and I am certain that the Minister with his customary assiduity has briefed himself on every aspect of these orders. What is the "special relationship" in article IV with regard to royalties? How is that to be defined? If the courts, for instance, are called on to construe this provision, are they to construe it by the light of nature or is there some definition of "special relationship"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I think it was implicit in what the Minister told us a moment ago, could he tell us—for the benefit of myself and my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), who, however, has a deeper understanding of these matters than I have—why there is this asymmetry between United Kingdom credit relief and Norwegian exemption relief? Is it because of the Norwegian system of taxation which he described in outline? Is he confident that this asymmetry will not lead to hardship in certain cases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the Luxembourg order. Again I am happy to see that dividends are defined as including everything that is regarded as a distribution in this country. But in paragraph (7) of the new article X there is a disallowance of relief or exclusion from relief where there is an effective connection between a holding of shares and a permanent establishment in the country concerned. Again, I am always rather suspicious of these new phrases. I have not come across the phrase "an effective connection" before. What does the Minister intend by that phrase? Although I know that these matters may ultimately have to be considered by the courts, it would be helpful to know what the Government had in mind when they negotiated this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is a little curiosity, and I hope that the Committee will not think that I am frivolous in raising it. Under article 3 of the order, the new article
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
XXV(2)(	<i>c</i>) says that certain dividends are to be exempt in Luxembourg, but it then goes on to say:
	<br><q><p>"tax deducted in the United Kingdom … shall not be credited against Luxembourg tax."</p></q>
If the dividends are to be exempt from tax in Luxembourg, how can any tax deducted in the United Kingdom be credited against Luxembourg tax? It may not be a point of great significance, but I raise it more out of curiosity than out of any general principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I ask the Minister a more general question. One knows that investment trusts set up in Luxembourg are exempt from tax there too. Are they outwith or within this double tax convention? If an investment trust set up in Luxembourg has substantial holdings of United Kingdom shares, is it to be treated in precisely the same way? There is a special animal, as I understand, under the Luxembourg fiscal code and it might be helpful to know whether investment trusts come in for any special treatment or whether they fall to be treated in precisely the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No particular points occur to me on the Malawi order, but my right hon. Friend may have some points to make on it. I therefore turn to the Venezuelan order. Article 1 states:
	<br><q><p>"The provisions of this Article shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency."</p></q>
What exactly is meant by this? Would a joint venture or a partnership—terms well understood by English lawyers—be regarded as a joint business, for instance? Could the Minister give us a little help on the precise meaning of article 1(2)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then come to article 3, which is a curious article. In case it does not immediately come to the Committee's mind, I shall read it:
	<br><q><p>"The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulty or doubt arising out of the application of this Agreement. The competent authorities may communicate with each other for this purpose."</p></q>
I wonder why this has been put in. Is it no more than a pious hope or is there some definite, practical machinery by which these matters are to be resolved? One hopes that whenever we enter into contractual relationships with another country, if any difficulties or doubts arise, we shall always continue negotiating in an endeavour to resolve them. If there is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
practical machinery and if difficulties and doubts assail an individual United Kingdom taxpayer, can he activate this machinery?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that somewhat the same provision is to be found in one of the other double taxation orders which we are debating. I suspect that it is the Jordanian one, but it would be helpful if the Minister would clarify our minds on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 states:
	<br><q><p>"The expression 'undertaking of one of the Contracting States' means the Government of that Contracting State, a physical person resident in that Contracting State".</p></q>
I notice that the term "a physical person" is creeping into double tax conventions. What is meant by "physical person"? Is the term limited to an individual taxpayer? Does it cover a body corporate, trustee or partnerships? Will the Minister again enlighten us on this point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee does not feel that I have taken up the time with points of detail, but so often on fiscal legislation and double tax conventions it is the detail that turns out to be important. In principle, we on this side of the Committee welcome the orders, although I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby has some powerful comments to make on them. But before we approve them or give them our support and commendation, we should be grateful for a little more assistance from the Minister than he has been able to give us so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee only for a brief moment and I shall not accept the invitation of the hon. and learned Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees) to branch off into the question of wealth tax, since we are considering today mainly the effects of income tax, corporation tax, petroleum revenue tax, development land tax and capital gains tax in the United Kingdom and a number of other taxes in the countries in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of those who may be worried about the timing of the implementation of these agreements, I should be interested to know when the Minister expects, from the best information we have, that the Government of Malawi will be in a position to have the assent of its Assembly to the convention there. Most of the other countries concerned have Parliaments which meet fairly fre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
quently. I know that the Assembly in Zomba normally meets only in August. I take it, therefore, that in the case of Malawi it is a reasonable expectation that people who are subject to these conventions will not expect, assuming that all goes well, to have to get to work on them until the Assembly in Zomba has dealt with them rather later in the year than other Governments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.48 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise not as an appointed member of the Committee but to inform the Committee of the proceedings of the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments with regard to these orders. It was regrettable that the Committee could deal with them only fairly recently. Therefore, no formal report has come before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to three of these orders—those relating to Venezuela, Jordan and Malawi—I have no point to raise. The Committee will appreciate that the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments has nothing whatever to do with the merits of the orders. I am sure that they are all very meritorious. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees) has dealt with the points which arise on the merits very ably and fully. That Joint Select Committee is concerned, among other things, with the vires—the authority under which the orders are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two orders relating to Norway and Luxembourg respectively raise a query, which I am sure the Minister will be able to settle but which was not immediately obvious to the Joint Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It relates to the kinds of taxes with which the orders deal. In the Norway order they are listed in article I of the schedule as:
	<ol>
	<li>"the income tax;</li>
	<li>the corporation tax;</li>
	<li>the petroleum revenue tax; and</li>
	<li>the capital gains tax".</li>
</ol>
In the Luxembourg order, again in article I, they are listed as:
	<ol>
	<li>"the income tax;</li>
	<li>the corporation tax;</li>
	<li>the petroleum revenue tax;</li>
	<li>the development land tax; and</li>
	<li>the capital gains tax".</li>
</ol>
These orders, we are told in the preamble, are made:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
	<br><q><p>"in accordance with the provisions of section 497(8) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970".</p></q>
As the Committee will know, that was a consolidation Act which comprised a number of earlier provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also mentioned in the preamble, in the case of Norway, that section 98 of the Finance Act 1972 gives power to Her Majesty to make that order; in the case of Luxembourg, section 98(2) of the Finance Act 1972 and section 39 of the Finance Act 1965 are cited. As I understand section 98 of the Finance Act 1972, it has nothing whatever to do with the kind of taxes about which an order of this kind can be made. I am therefore mainly concerned with section 497 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That section authorised orders of this kind only if they dealt with income tax or corporation tax. As I read that section, it does not extend to anything more. But in the schedule to the 1970 Act, section 39 of the Finance Act 1965 was brought into the 1970 Act. One therefore adds to the income tax and corporation tax the capital gains tax, which was brought under these orders by section 39 of the Finance Act 1965. Any order dealing with income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax is therefore 	<i>intra vires</i> Her Majesty by an order of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, however, could find no authority for orders of this kind being made in relation to petroleum revenue tax or development land tax. I should be grateful if the Minister would inform the Committee on that point. In wading through the relevant sections, if I may so put it, I could find no provision which authorised Her Majesty to make orders relating to double taxation concerning petroleum revenue tax and development land tax, even by such 	<i>ejusdem generis</i> phrases as "or similar taxes".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, petroleum revenue tax is not a similar tax to income tax or corporation tax. As the Minister informed me many times in dealing with another Bill, development land tax is not income tax. Therefore it is not 	<i>ejusdem generis</i> with income tax. He may be able to put his finger on it and settle this point right away. In the normal course of events, the Joint Select Committee would have asked his advisers for a memorandum of this point, to inform that Committee of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
authorities under which these two orders were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was not time to do that. Therefore, I have to take up the time of this Committee to endeavour to get the matter settled, without its going further, from the Joint Select Committee to the Minister's advisers and back again, with them perhaps having to give evidence to that Committee. If the Minister can settle that point now, it will mean a great saving of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Development land tax and petroleum revenue tax will be credited only by the foreign Government; therefore their inclusion does not impose an obligation on the United Kingdom Government. They are included for clarification in the foreign country as being taxes of a similar type to those already covered. So there is no obligation here imposed upon the United Kingdom Government. They are included merely to attract credit in the foreign country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt the Minister on that? Both orders list the taxes affected by the order in two lists. There is one for the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. Those are listed and they include in one case petroleum revenue tax and in the other that tax and development land tax. Then, under another heading, in Norway in one instance and in Luxembourg in the other, their taxes are listed under various descriptions which obviously do not apply to United Kingdom taxes. So the orders do not make it clear that petroleum revenue tax and development land tax are, so far as this country is concerned, untouched by these orders. They are very definitely within the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that they were untouched by the orders. I was answering the point that I thought was raised by the right hon. Gentleman namely that there was no power under Section 497 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 to impose any obligation on the United Kingdom. Article 1 states correctly:
