	<div class='title'>SCOTTISH GRAND COMMITTEE</div> <!-- title -->
	<time>Thursday 14th December 1978</time>
	<p>[MR. PETER DOIG 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed [12th December],</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House' that the Committee have considered the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill in relation to the principle of the Bill.—[	<i>The Lord Advocate.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.32 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamish Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We find ourselves in a very unfortunate position this morning. We have to consider the principle of a Bill put forward by a Government who have lost the confidence of their own supporters and who can no longer command a majority in the House. They have lost the support of the minority parties who were keeping—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank God for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As their own Whip so rightly says, thank God for that. He may thank God for some part of it, but we thank God for the fact that the minority parties have at last seen sense and are giving support where support is deserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill before us may, therefore, not go any further. Our attitude towards it must accordingly be slightly different. We must now concentrate on trying to present to the Committee possible additions which might be written into a future Bill by a future Government. It seems highly unlikely that this Government will be in existence at all after tonight. Therefore, it is probably as well that we should set out some of the things that we should like to see included in a criminal justice Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman using the Royal "we"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall of course, discuss what is in the Bill before us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still wondering what the hon. Gentleman means by "we". Is he using the Royal plural?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Doig. I refer to those of us who are for the time being sitting on the Opposition Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. Ronald King Murray)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The minority party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, the earlier remarks of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McMillan), to which I referred on Tuesday, were important. The hon. Gentleman did one useful thing in that he drew attention to the worry throughout Scotland about the very high crime rate which we now suffer. He drew attention also to the fact that there appears to be very little in the Bill which will actually allay the fears of the elderly, particularly those who live in areas of cities which are from time to time under siege by gangs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Bill is not intended to do that and it is designed for the purpose purely of improving legal procedures. But we believe that such a Bill could well incorporate measures, such as deterrents of one sort or another, which would be acceptable to the people and would make for the better governing of the country under its legal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to look back at statistics. The trend started as far back as 1914. Between 1914 and 1918, there was an escalation of crime in Scotland. Then, despite the deprivations between 1918 and 1939, it is interesting to note that the crime rate had not risen materially by 1939. But after the last war we have had the Criminal Justice Act of 1949, and since then our crime statistics have absolutely soared. We had in addition the Criminal Justice Act 1961 and the Criminal Justice Act (Scotland) 1963.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of those Acts appeared to have any effect on the crime rate. In each case, although the Act was presented as being a law reform, or a law improvement, the only thing it appeared to do for the general public was to make life a little bit easier for the criminal. This, surely, is not the most important part of our function in Parliament. I am much more concerned about the victim of crime than I am about the well-being of the criminal and the convicted man in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
I would go further and say that I do not agree with those who call for the reform of prisons and of conditions for prisoners. While I accept that there is room for improvement, it is not high in my list of priorities. I am much more concerned about improving conditions in prisons for the prison officers who have to look after the criminals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Harry Ewing)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two things go together. If the hon. Member is in favour of improving conditions for prison officers, he must also be in favour of improving conditions for the prisoners. The one cannot happen without the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that I said that I saw room for improvement but I was much more concerned about the welfare and well-being of the prison officer than about the criminal. That is my view. I think I am sure that it reflects the view of the vast majority of my constituents and, I suspect, the constituents of every other member of this Committee. As parliamentarians, we often fail truly to represent the views of our constituents on crime and punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statistics that have been given in 	<i>Hansard</i> are very important. These answers were, regrettably, not available to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) when he opened for the Opposition on Tuesday. My hon. Friend had asked the Secretary of State for Scotland
	<br><blockquote><p>"what was the total number of convictions for murder, attempted murder, rape and culpable homicide, respectively, in the most recent annual period for which figures are available; and what were the comparable totals in each of the previous 10 years."</p></blockquote>
The figures are staggering. In 1968 in Scotland the number of persons convicted of murder was 25; in 1977 the number Was 50. In 1968 the number of persons convicted of attempted murder was 18; in 1977 the number was 50. The number of persons convicted of rape in 1968 was 22; in 1977 the number was 35. The number convicted of culpable homicide in 1968 was 21, and in 1977 the number was 32. My hon. Friend also asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"what were the total numbers of crimes and offences, respectively."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11th December 1978; Vol. 960, cc. 55–6.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
The staggering figures which he received were that the total of crimes and offences in 1968 was 396,393, and for 1977 the figure was 644,804. If those figures do not cause the Committee to have serious misgivings about its activities on law and order in Scotland, I cannot think what can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was distressing for some of us in the Opposition to listen to the remarks of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscad-den (Mr. Dewar). He suggested that in our deliberations we should take account of the views of convicted criminals. The hon. Gentleman need not get excited. He must keep his wool on for a moment. At our last sitting my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rif-kind) said to him:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman is not one to be misunderstood by his constituents or by anyone else. For the record, will he state specifically whether he is seriously suggesting that the views of a convicted—not merely accused—person are a relevant consideration when this Committee is considering appropriate sentences for future legislation?"—[Official Report, 	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 12th December 1978; c. 30.J</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Garscadden very honestly replied "Yes" and gave his reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the views of the convicted man should never be taken into account? If so, will he put down an amendment to remove the condition that there must be consultation between the accused and the sheriff before a probation order is made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His views are given plenty of opportunity for consideration when he makes his plea of mitigation in court. But it is certainly not appropriate that his views can be considered here by us. I disagree entirely with the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has given a misleading example. When a felon is being considered for probation he is not asked "Would you like to go to prison, sonny, or would you like probation or a poke of sweets?" He is asked "Are you willing to obey the following conditions?" Only if he says "Yes" will he get probation. That is not consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made the point to the hon. Gentleman. I shall come back later to some of his other remarks, where I found myself in considerable sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the hon. Member for Garscadden, we had the strange utterance from the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). I am sorry that he is not here today, because I do not like to refer to someone during his absence. He referred to the arming of the police force. He briefly referred to the incident which happened last week when a police officer had to shoot someone carrying a sawn-off shot gun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West is extremely sincere in his views, and perhaps the impression he gave was quite wrong, just as the impression that the hon. Member for Garscadden gives at times is quite wrong, but the point is that the impression given to us and to people outside by Labour Members is that they are always looking for excuses for the criminal and only too ready to criticise the police. That is the impression given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not rubbish. It is absolutely correct. I know that there are some hon. Members on the Labour Benches who do not take that view, but it is always from that side of the House that excuses for the criminal are presented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is not here, but one of the points he made was that it would appear that the police are now armed as a matter of routine, and that is alarming and distressing. I should have thought that it as distressing to the police as to the general public. Is that not a simple proposition? Would not the hon. Gentleman share that anxiety? That is not anti-police. I am sure that that proposition would get a lot of support from the Police Federation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is, if I may say so with respect, a naive view. The police are armed more often than they once were because of the increase in the number of armed crimes. Therefore, it is necessary that the police should be armed more often than they used to be. In addition if, over the years, we as a legislative body—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are too many conversations taking place. Hon. Members should listen to the Member who has the Floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, over a period of years, we as a legislative body in Parliament persist in removing the deterrents which used to exist against the commission of serious and violent crimes, naturally those crimes will tend to increase, and the chief constables of the various forces will find that there will be more occasions on which they would wish their officers to be armed. These are facts from which we cannot escape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great pity that we have not set about reforming the law in Scotland with more consideration towards creating deterrents to crime than we have until now. My hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart has been criticised both from the Front Bench and from Back Benchers on the Government side. But let us make no mistake about it: what my hon. Friend said on Tuesday, and what he has fearlessly said on many occasions, is very much in tune with the general feeling of ordinary people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not talking about the do-gooders that we have on the Government Benches by the dozen. I am talking about ordinary people in Scotland who are worried about muggers and about thugs who beat up elderly people—and not so elderly people, too. My great sympathy is extended to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West, but he is reasonably healthy and therefore survived the ordeal. Had he been an elderly person we might well have had another case of murder on our hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I of the Bill, which is concerned with police powers of detention, has already been dealt with at some length by certain of my hon. Friends. I have some sympathy with the remarks of the hon. Member for Garscadden because I am not convinced that it is an improvement to spell out in terms of time police powers to take somebody to the police station and keep him there for a specific time. I do not know that it is altogether fair to the accused or to the police, and that is something we should discuss in more detail in Committee, if the Bill ever reaches the Committee stage. We do not know—it will depend on events tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give one example of the drafting which lends itself to a certain amount
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
of Committee argument. Clause 3 is concerned with the rights of persons arrested to have informed someone "reasonably named by him". I can imagine, if the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross), were in opposition, the amendments he would put down relating to that type of drafting. He would have us here for about two whole mornings discussing what "reasonably named by him" might mean. We should try to be a little more specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On clauses 5 to 12, concerned with bail, I make the point—although I do not take a particularly strong view on the matter—that at the moment the categories which are excluded from receiving bail are all clearly defined, but I am not 100 per cent, satisfied that by doing away with money bail we should ultimately achieve all that the right hon. and learned Gentleman suggested when he introduced the Bill. However, again that is something which is more of a Committee point which we could argue in greater detail at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to say a brief word about part III and to relate it to my own constituency. It could possibly also be related to the constituencies of other hon. Members who represent rural areas. I take, for example, Clause 20—" Prevention of delay in trials." That is something with which I am sure we should all agree. However, I wonder just what the Government have in mind in order to make that improvement. In my constituency, the courts at both Dingwall and Tain are booked, or committed, until March 1979. From reading the Bill, I take it to be the suggestion that more powers be given to the district courts. I presume that the intention, by doing that, would be that pressure be relieved on sheriff courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it is as simple as that. The additional powers given to district courts should be very small. I certainly should not like to see district courts given very much more powers than they have at present. It is important that the powers of the sheriff courts be maintained and that—to use a popular expression—they are not devolved in any way. Again, that is something for the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if we decide in Committee that we shall not give the district courts
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
more powers, I presume that the Government have in mind either to increase staff, whether by creating more sheriffs or by creating more fiscals. I am not sure what they have in mind. Certainly, the fiscal service in many parts of the country at the moment is considerably burdened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 26 redefines "officer of law" from the definition contained in the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 so that citations may be served by a citation service. That is something about which we really need to know a little more. As I understand the matter, the present procedure is that a citation is served by a police officer. Let us take as an example—admittedly it is an exceptional case—the village of Achiltibuie in my constituency, which lies 23 miles north west of Ullapool and is a fair way from the sheriff court in Dingwall. If a citation has to be served on somebody there, how should one set about it? At present, it would be delivered by the local policeman, a perfectly simple and straightforward operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a citation service, what terrifies me is that it will be another arm of bureaucracy and somebody in a 2.8 Granada will motor all the way from Dingwall in order to serve a citation on someone in a place like Achiltibuie. The same could apply to Torridon, to Shieldaig or to any of the other western villages in my constituency. The provision is straightforward enough for the cities, but I have some reservations about it in respect of rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens to the unfortunate citation officer—or whatever he will be called—if he goes to Achiltibuie in his Granada on eight separate occasions only to find that the chap is out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can relieve the anxiety of hon. Members. The proposal is that citation officers shall be used in the urban areas and I can reassure the inhabitants of Achiltibuie that they will still be cited by the local police officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Lord Advocate for that answer, because I could see great difficulties arising. If that is an indication of his attitude through-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
out the Committee, if we ever reach the Committee stage, he will no doubt be prepared to accept reasonable amendments and constructive suggestions as we go along. I thank him for satisfying me on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to continue any longer because a number of colleagues on both sides wish to participate. I say again that, while I welcome the Bill and accept that it has many good things in it, I am sorry that it does not tackle more positively the major problem of crime in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.57 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that one of the benefits of not having had an October election is that the Committee can consider the Bill at this time. If the country had gone to the polls in October and if there had still been an Assembly in the wings, it would have been tempting to leave these issues to be considered at some future time north of the border. We have been waiting for a considerable time for the Bill, for some 12 to 13 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I speak of matters such as this being considered at some future date north of the border, I emphasise that there is a need now, because of the long delay, for a rolling programme on the English pattern so that we can look at measures of reform year by year. Second, if there were to be a Committee system of legislature north of the border, it would be appropriate that all interested parties, be they the police, prison officers or the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, could be involved in the decision-makng process and speak at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with a few specific matters in the Bill—on detention, interrogation detoxification the under-21s and so forth—but it would be proper, as we are considering the principle, first to make a few remarks about the problems of crime and violence in Scotland. Most members of the Committee would recognise that there is no magic solution for turning Scotland into a non-violent culture overnight. There have to be interim measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no coincidence, and need be no cause for surprise, that while Scotland has 97 per cent, of the areas of highest multi-deprivation in the United Kingdom, an unemployment rate which hovers just below the 200,000 mark, almost a fifth
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
of a total population living below the official Government poverty line and one of the highest alcohol rates in the world, we simultaneously have a higher murder and attempted murder rate than do most European countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the problem of violence is to be brought under control in Scotland, it can be brought under control in the long run only by better living standards, improvements in the environment and so on. Much of the present violence, I believe, stems from sheer frustration and anger by individuals at their wretched environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, I want to touch briefly on punishment. Clearly, there are some offenders for whom the likelihood of detection has no deterrent effect whatsoever. Sentencing, the SNP recognises, is ultimately at the discretion of the judges, but it is our belief that there should be wider use of the recommendation system as suggested in the Emslie report, so that life sentences could mean life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a great deal from the liberals on this Committee about freedom—freedom for the criminal, the need for the criminal to retain his liberty—but at the same time there has to be freedom for the old lady who is in danger of being mugged and freedom not to be murdered in one's bed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, I come to prisons because this is germane to the whole argument. Our prisons in Scotland are an outright disgrace. Most were built in the Victorian era. They are geared to about one-third of their present prison population. Ninety-three per cent, of our prison population is serving time for non-payment of fines, petty theft offences, drunkenness and so on, and five out of six are serving sentences of under six months. It is an appalling Victorian situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prisons should not be used as substitutes for hostels, hospitals or detoxification centres. For that reason, we welcome the proposals in the Bill. There is an urgent need to develop an alternative form of treatment for the alcoholic vagrant, other than the present system of constant fortnightly sentences on the "revolving door" principle. I have seen outside Gatehouse prison, in the old days when it was a women's prison, a prisoner being released, spending her £2 or £3, getting drunk and breaking a telephone kiosk simply to be taken back inside the system. That, clearly, is not the right way
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
to deal with people who suffer from alcoholism, poverty, and friendlessness and so on which should not be treated as punishable crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to Clause 1, which gives power to detain suspects or witnesses for a short period to obtain information. I believe this to be justified. After all, there is a public interest in clearing up crime, and people who find themselves involved in a situation or who know something about it can reasonably be required by law to make a minimal contribution to the clearing up by supplying names and addresses. Of course, in some cases it may lead to harassment of known criminals or to people whom the police regard as criminal types, but it is an inescapable part of police practice to look for those who are capable of the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I should like to see added is that the police officer should warn the suspect, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) said at our previous sitting, that his replies may be used in evidence. In that way the suspect is aware of his legal rights all the time. If, having heard that warning, the suspect does not wish to give an explanation, it is right and proper for the police officer to proceed to the next stage under Clause 2 and take the suspect to the police station while other inquiries are being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That introduces interrogation procedure into Scottish law, and the period recommended by the Thomson committee of six hours detention has been reduced to four in the Bill, again, together with my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East, I believe that to be somewhat on the high side, because these days, with computers, cross-index file and memory systems, four hours are not really necessary. As my hon. Friend suggested, about two hours would perhaps be more appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) on Tuesday with regard to taping. I have a good deal of sympathy for that idea. But when I talked to a senior police officer in my own constituency recently, he made the following comment: "Aye, and as soon as the tape is switched on and the individual is warned that the tape is running, he will say, first, 'Oh that was sore'." There is a danger, if the tapes are running and
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
there is no other form of corroboration, that the experienced criminal can turn it to his own advantage. I would not advocate video systems, although they are used widely in the United States. But I believe that there is cause for some concern in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, the question of the person who is drunk and incapable. The real problem here is the time scale. I am not sure exactly what the clauses mean. Do they mean that the centre is to be an alternative to the night in the cells? The absence of any reference to treatment in the substantive part of the Bill would suggest so. In that case, is it worth paying for special institutions when police cells already exist?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, detoxification is mentioned in the explanatory notes and suggests more than care. This point should be cleared up. When does the threat expire? The person cannot be expected to remain in care indefinitely. Perhaps the answer is—when the drunkenness wears off. But that must be cleared up during the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to two short points which have not been touched upon by other hon. Members. First, I take clause 14 and courts on Saturdays. Perhaps pressure from the sheriff clerk's branch of the CPSA lies behind this. Many public services such as the police have to work on Saturdays, and the proposals here could mean great congestion in the courts on Mondays when the liberated accused and those in custody from Friday, Saturday and Sunday appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, I shall touch upon the provisions for the under-21s. Something useful will be lost if a sentence which is seen to be appropriate to the offence is not publicly passed. There is a borstal in my constituency as well as the detention centre for Scotland at Glenochil, Detention centres were viewed as retributive, as a deterrent, borstals as reformative, and young offenders' institutions as merely custodial. But if we are now to have the powers of anonymous administration of the penal system extended, I believe that this will lead to some distrust and should be reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end on this note. Crime in Scotland, as members of the official Opposition have said, has now risen to such a level that all political parties disregard the subject at their peril. The same principle applies to the shameful neglect of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
penal system in Scotland, which has resulted in some of the worst prison conditions in Europe, although I appreciate that in recent years there have been some attempts at reform. There will be fundamental changes in Scotland with regard to crime only when there is a fundamental change in people's living standards. At the same time, we have to have interim measures. We in the SNP steer a middle course between those reactionaries who would advocate a return to the dark ages and those who shout a great deal for excessive liberalism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.6 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief as I know that many of my hon. Friends wish to speak this morning. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said that all those who are practising lawyers have an interest in the Bill, but I argue that anyone in Scotland should have an interest in the administration of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo what the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Reid) said about the Emslie report. While we very much welcome the Bill so far as it goes, with reservations in certain respects, it seems a notable omission that the Emslie report is not covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three important reasons why the Emslie recommendations should be included under part IV. First, I take the murder record in Scotland. In 1963 there were only two, in 1975 the figure had risen to 37, and in 1977 it was 50. One of the contributory factors causing the rise in really serious crime is the lack of deterrent value of the present life sentence. I had an Answer last Monday which makes clear that a life sentence in fact averages somewhere between six and 10 years. If a judge lays down a minimum recommendation as to the length of time a convicted murderer should stay in prison, that would seem to carry considerably more deterrent value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first reason, therefore, is deterrence. George Watt, legal correspondent for the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> wrote last February.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Emslie Committee's report fairly reflected the public attitude in Scotland … The Emsilie idea certainly has public appeal, and doubtless also political merit, since a swingeing sentence in terms of actual years is much more telling than the indeterminate 'life' which arouses suspicion, especially in the minds of
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
opponents of parole and release on licence, and everything that smells of the soft option."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps, if a prisoner behaves perfectly for 10 years and at that stage it is considered that it would be safe to release him although the minimum recommendation has been, say, 12 years, the Secretary of State might override the recommendation. But I suggest that there is a much heavier onus on the Secretary of State to examine the problem very closely indeed. There was the case of one Mr. Forbes who committed murder, was released from prison a few years later and committed murder again. That kind of event would be much less likely to occur if the Emslie report were implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why the Emslie report should be implemented is that it is far more fair and consistent. Let me deal with the question of fairness. In the summary of conclusions of his report, Lord Emslie said that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in addition to recommending a minimum period the judge should state the factors upon which his recommendation is based so that his view of the offence and the offender, on the basis of the evidence at the trial, might be recorded for future use".</p></blockquote>
What is unfair under the present system is that when a convicted murderer conies up for parole years later, the judge is asked to give his view. Six, seven or eight years after the judge has had all the evidence, that evidence is not fresh in his mind. Even if he reads every single word again and goes into the matter in depth, the actual demeanour of the witnesses and the character of the accused as he gave evidence in the dock is less fresh in the judge's mind, and his opinion, six, seven or eight years after the case, carries less weight than it would at the time of the trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason, therefore, is that the Emslie recommendation is more fair because the judge can give a more accurate impression at the time of the case. In his article in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> Mr. George Watt said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the merits of the Emslie view is that it would introduce some kind of consistency into sentences imposed by various Scottish Judges who are known to hold different views on the recommended minimum."</p></blockquote>
We all know the reason why it is not being implemented. I think it was the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) who expressed the view some years ago that it was not necessary in the light
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
of experience, but we all know that in practice the probable reason is that the prisons are now overcrowded. I suggest to the Minister that the emphasis should be directed towards releasing minor criminals but that the more serious criminals who commit premeditated murder should be treated more toughly. The first aim should be to protect the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on from that to the suspended sentence. In clause 47, part suspended sentence is proposed. It may well be that, in a crime of passion, when a husband tries to strangle his wife after some gross provocation—for example, the wife saying that her baby is by another man, or something of that nature—and the husband then repents, a wholly suspended sentence might be much more appropriate than a part suspended sentence. In practice, the Bill as drafted might lead to a situation where a prisoner sentenced to six months would serve the whole sentence but a prisoner deemed worthy of a sentence of 12 months might serve only three months. Obviously, a man's employment opportunities may be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), in a powerful speech on Tuesday, made clear on clause 4—the provision for alcoholics—that sufficient resources must be made available. I quote now what the chief inspector of constabulary wrote in 1977:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nowadays, police forces do not have the manpower available to patrol streets and public places to prevent some of the mass of petty crime arising through drinking or to make even token inquiry to trace the perpetrators … Society has the choice: either devote substantial resources to tackle the alcohol problem or accept that the nation's crime, disorder and road death and injury problems caused by alcohol will constantly increase."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will bear in mind the importance of providing resources to ensure that there are the necessary detoxification centres throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of bail, the hon. Member for Garscadden mentioned that, as chief reporter for Lanarkshire, his experience was that money bail was not an appropriate form of bail. In fact, there are certain criminals who are extremely wealthy, and money bail could be a useful option in their case. I suggest
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
that money bail should not be ruled out altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most important issue in the eyes of the electorate in Scotland is the treatment of murderers who commit murder with complete premeditation. If life sentence in their case works out at only somewhere between six and 10 years, that is not sufficient, and implementation of the Emslie recommendations would be a considerable source of relief to a great many members of the public in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.13 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Selby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little perturbed about part I. Am I not correct in saying that normally in Scotland it is necessary for two constables to charge or stop someone and take him to the police station for investigation? 1 may be wrong, but it seems that we are giving power to one constable, with no mention of whether he is in uniform or plain clothes, and there are detective constables as well as police constables. I think that this is too indeterminate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right and the power is to be given to "a constable", we could have a similarity with what happens in Northern Ireland. There was the case mentioned last week during the debate on Northern Ireland of one man who had been detained 300 times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to tell my hon Friend that he is wrong. We still preserve the law of corroboration in Scotland. The only departure is in the case of traffic wardens. If my hon. Friend should park his car on a yellow line, it would be all right for one warden to give him a parking ticket. But in all other respects we still preserve the law of corroboration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Selby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied with that answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the past 10 years in Scotland, the crime curve has made an almost vertical ascent. We have had figures quoted this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) showing that the number of crimes known to the police has literally almost doubled in those 10 years from just over 150,000 a year in 1977 to just over 300,000 last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sadness of this Bill is that it will not do much to halt that terrifying rise in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
crime. The measures proposed do not match up to the magnitude of the crisis which now faces us in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that seventeen Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and seventeen Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a time when judges were feared by criminals, when sentences were tough, and nobody laughed at the law. Unfortunately, that no longer applies. Judges are no longer feared by criminals, sentences are no longer as tough as they were, and where they are tough they tend to be diminished by remission and parole. Too many people laugh at the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the hon. Member for Clack-manam and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Reid) rightly implied—he did not develop the point—it is not enough just to detect a crime if, following detection, the punishment is not severe enough. Although we all know that punishment is not the only answer to deterring crime, it certainly is the biggest single answer for most criminals. One of our major regrets about the Bill is that it will do nothing to end the diminishing of deterrence as a factor in the maintenance of law and order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When judges were feared and sentences were tough ordinary law-abiding people could walk the streets for the most part in confidence and safety. We on the Opposition Benches resent deeply and passionately the fact that ordinary law-abiding people can no longer go about their business without fear of being attacked or of becoming involved in brawls. It is shameful that old-age pensioners, for example, are no longer confident that they can go out at night even in the main streets of our cities. Public meetings have to be postponed if they cannot take place before the hours of darkness. That is a shameful change in this country, and I should be very sorry if there were any dispute on either side of the Committee about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member tell us when was this golden age of virtually crime-free society? At one time Members of Parliament could not walk home unless they went in groups
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
accompanied by policemen. That is why, to this day, when the House adjourns the policeman still shouts "Who goes home?" That suggests that perhaps conditions are improving compared with an age gone by.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for his history lesson. Had he been attending at the beginning of my speech, he would know that I do not have to go back more than 10 years to see not a golden age but an age of a metal more shining that than we live in now, when the number of crimes made known to the police in Scotland was only 152,000. Last year it was over 300,000. That is almost double in 10 years. We are not using any loose talk about golden ages. We are looking at statistics. I cannot understand why anybody on either side of the Committee should refuse to look at the facts. They are not party-political facts. I should not want to make this a party-political issue unless the feebleness of certain hon. Members on the Government side made it inevitable by their refusal to do enough about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I want to see—and what, alas, we do not see in the Bill—is that the law must be given back the authority and ability to sustain civilised standards. That is what we want and it is not what we are being given in the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cath-cart (Mr. Taylor) pointed out on Tuesday, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) to day, that when ordinary people are afraid to walk the streets after dark we do not have civilised standards as we once understood them. We are talking not about a hypothetical future but about a known and factual past and present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Member for El Salvador—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: West Salvador.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) should have disputed that, because the fact is that today we have more crimes than we have ever had, we have a greater shortage of police and a smaller percentage of crimes cleared up. It seems to me that those three facts demand of the House of Commons that we take far tougher action than we appear to be getting in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his amiable speech on Tuesday, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
Lord Advocate said—I paraphrase, but I do so correctly, I believe—that we should all welcome there being fewer people in prison and that that should be something to which we should look forward. Yes, indeed, we should look forward to fewer people being in prison if that were a result of fewer crimes having been committed. But we are concerned that more crimes are being committed. In fact, the number of known crimes has almost doubled over 10 years. The idea that we should all approve of there being fewer people in prison cannot be taken outside the context of the fact that there are more crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should say quite clearly that we need more prisons and we need different sorts of prison. I do not think that we should flinch from saying that loud and clear. We should be building the sort of prisons that we need but do not have. First, there should be new tough detention centres where the regime would be one of no nonsense and everything at the double, with not too many dewy-eyed social workers in sight—a type of crash course in learning not to commit offences again. That is the first sort that we need, for the young thugs and the young criminals. It is a frightening fact about the rise in crime that almost half the burglaries now are committed by people of 16 and under. It should make us wonder what sort of generation we are breeding when such a terrifying amount of crime is committed by people of 16 and under.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need new tougher detention centres. Second, there should be a few—perhaps one in Scotland and others elsewhere in the United Kingdom—fortress prisons for the hard evil men who need to be taken out of society for a long time, not because the prime motive would be rehabilitating them but to take them out of society for its protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, we need more and better prisons of the type that we have at the moment where there would be better conditions both for the prisoners through less overcrowding and, more importantly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty said, for the warders, who must, of course, rank much more highly in our sense of priorities than the prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that one cannot do anything to help the warders without helping the
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
prisoners at the same time, which seemed to be the implication of the intervention by the Under-Secretary of State, is ridiculous. There was a strike at Dartmoor the other day when the warders said that their living conditions were actually worse than those of the prisoners. Simply improving the warders' homes is a specific way in which their conditions would be improved, without anything having to be done for the prisoners at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a red herring to say that the two must be done together, or that we do not have much money and therefore cannot do anything, which was the implication of the hon. Gentleman's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman accept that in order to improve working conditions for prison officers—who are just as entitled to have good working conditions as are Members of Parliament—it is necessary to improve the conditions for the prisoners themselves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I agree that one of the ways of improving conditions for warders is to improve conditions in the prisons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Prison officers, not warders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, prison officers. But that is only one of the ways. That is the point my hon. Friend was making. Pay is another. Accommodation, as I said, is another way. I merely seek to nail the sloppy attitude of "We cannot do anything for these people because we do not have enough money to build more prisons and therefore we are not going to do anything."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth sort of prisons we should be building are hostel prisons for the alcoholics, vagrants and social in-adequates. It is totally wrong that so many different types of prisoners should be quite arbitrarily lumped together simply because the Government prefer to spend money on other objectives which I believe should rank as far lesser priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to two specific points in the Bill. First, as regards bail I am prepared to be convinced by the argument the Lord Advocate advanced on Tuesday that money bail is not a satisfactory
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
form of bail. By and large, I accept that he made out a good case for having conditions rather than money. But I hope that those conditions will not be extended too far. At present we do not have enough room in our prisons, and we shall be pretending that we are extending bail for reasons of improving bail rather than admitting that we are doing so because we do not have enough places in our prisons to accommodate these people, although we should like to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that I believe we should not flinch from building more prisons. I certainly want to see far tougher conditions on those released on bail than obtain at present. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) quoted the chief constable of Grampian on the sort of people being released on bail and going on to commit further crimes. I expect everybody in the Committee knows of people being released on two, three or, in one case known to me, four occasions and each time committing a fresh crime. It takes no great stretch of the imagination to think what this does to the morale of the police, who pick up someone they suspect of committing a crime only to find that he has been released on bail and a week later pick him up on a further crime. That must be totally disheartening to the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like no bail granted to anyone who has committed a crime of violence. No bail should be granted to anybody, whatever they may be charged with, who has previously committed either a serious non-violent crime or a violent crime. Neither should anyone be given bail who is already out on bail on another charge. Although there would not be a gigantic improvement in Scotland, it is the one specific and easily made improvement that would raise the morale of the police and encourage ordinary people who feel that criminals get away with too much too easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I refer to clause 36 which provides that courts should take into account the character and circumstances of the criminal. This clause reeks of all the false priorities which have infected far too much of the thinking of those who concern themselves with law and order in Scotland. The clause gets the values absolutely upside down. It states that
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court shall obtain information about that person's circumstances".</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that the circumstances of the criminal should be a major factor in the court's decision. The court should judge on the crime, and the punishment should fit the crime, not the individual's circumstances. There may be odd occasions—the odd 5 per cent.—but basically every man and woman, if he or she commits a certain crime, whether he or she be an MP or a millionaire, a dustman, a pauper, whatever—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A life peer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—should know what the sentence will be. The circumstances should not influence it in any way suggested in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts are not in the compassion business. The courts are in the justice business. If it should happen that compassion and justice are opposed in any case, which they often are, justice must win. Justice is the most precious—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Too many conversations are going on in the Committee. In fairness to the one who has the Floor, hon. Members should pay attention to what he is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Doig. I was making the point that if compassion or mercy are in opposition to justice in public life, justice must win. What I dislike about the clause is that it is softening down that concept. Justice is almost the most precious commodity that we have in our democracy. I do1 not believe that it is the duty of courts to take into account all the individual circumstances and say "We shall be lenient in this case because the man had a terrible time the night before, his wife has just left him" or whatever. If he commits a crime he should receive the punishment for that crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential thing which must be done and which this Bill, good enough as it is as far as it goes, alas, does not do, is to give back to the law the authority which it needs to sustain civilised standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat). I find it incredible that in all his utterances he seems to put his brain into neutral and lets his hatred take over. All that seems to come out of him is sheer hatred, and very few constructive suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read some of Tuesday's debate. Some of my hon. Friends and hon. Members from the other side, particularly the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) tried to look at the Bill and the whole problem of crime, with a certain amount of detached attempt to get to the bottom of the problem. Of course the figures are high. They have increased greatly and indeed all over the world, not just in the United Kingdom. Different methods have been tried all over the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was in the United States in the summer, and visited the fortress prison in the bay outside San Francisco. The fabric of the building is rotting and is now a tourist attraction, because it just did not work. These tough methods have been tried in various parts of the world. I am not saying that some of them would not work here and at certain times would not work in other places. But, as many of my Friends said on Tuesday, this is an incredibly complicated matter. We do not quite know what is happening in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, and some of his hon. Friends, continue to spread the mythology of tough sentences on the lines "If only we could do something, everything would disappear". My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) mentioned the origin of the phrase "Who goes home? ', and underlined the fact that Members of Parliament used to be escorted home. I have heard this all my life from sheriffs and law people. One of the first letters I ever wrote to a newspaper I sent to the old "John Bull". It contained an article on Glasgow with a picture of Bridgetown Cross, which I knew extremely well, telling the people of Britain that any stranger who was seen near that area was noted and followed until he ultimately left the area. This was supposed to be a serious article.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another article concerned a sheriff in Glasgow 20 years ago who was alleged to have told people that no person could possibly walk along parts of Shettleston Road after 10 o'clock at night. That was

a nonsensical statement. I am not saying that there are not and have not been muggings, but I am stressing that continual exaggeration does no good at all. Society has experienced enormous changes, not just here, but all over the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know the answers, but many provisions in the Bill will help us to get closer to the answers.

Several hon. Members have visited prisons in Scotland, some of which are showing great hope. Some prisons are putting new ideas into practice. Those methods must be an improvement on the old Peterhead, Inverness and Dartmoor type of prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will deal with the problem that besets prison officers. In spite of the view of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South and some of his hon. Friends that prison regimes are too soft, I believe that far too many of them still operate with a nineteenth century philosophy—engendered partly by the type of buildings in which prisons are housed, and partly by the conditions of prison officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of matters which should be put to my hon. Friend and his Department. For instance, I feel that it is merely a matter of convenience that prison officers are still tied to accommodation prison houses. In the days when Dartmoor was built, and even in Barlinnie in Glasgow which was considered a long way from the centre of the city, houses were built to enable the officers to live near the prison. This is deeply resented by many of the prison officers. They, in common with every other member of the community, would like to have a certain amount of freedom. As long as they live in a prison house they feel tied to the service. This does not lead to their giving of their best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a great deal more training of prison officers. Officers to whom I have spoken are conscious of the fact that the six weeks intake training they receive is not sufficient. One assumes that the punishment of prison begins when the door slams behind the new entrant, and that from then on that person's freedom is restricted. The true punishment arises from the fact that that person is cut off from the rest of the world. Once that door slams, the prison officers should be equipped to rehabilitate many of those

	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
prisoners. Unlike some Opposition Members, I believe that the vast majority of people who go to prison are recoverable. Yet the recidivist rate in Scotland, which has one of the most severe prison systems in Western Europe, is amongst the highest in Western Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cannot the hon. Gentleman see that because of that kind of attitude, we are not getting on top of the problem? We have allowed ourselves to be influenced by this psychiatric society. Psychiatrists now play a much greater part in dealing with criminals than they ever did previously, and it is not succeeding. The figures are worse than they have ever been. This has happened because we have removed all the disciplines and deterrents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carmichael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman believes that, he is reading the wrong sort of material. The amount of real rehabilitation work in Scottish prisons is minimal. In terms of material conditions, and staff ratios, the United Kingdom still has one of the harshest prison systems in Western Europe and among the highest recidivist rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am always amazed at people's attitude to psychiatrists and do-gooders, I have always thought of St Francis of Assisi as the classic do-gooder, but he has been dead so long, that we can look back on him with a certain amount of nostalgia. But in his day he was a do-gooder. Sometimes those whom people call "do-gooders" improve the lot of the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with the argument about harshness and example. Many years ago pickpockets in London had a field day at open-air galas and the public hangings—even when the hangman's victim was a pickpocket. Since the offenders were not deterred, it proves that the sheer deterrent works with some people but not with many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) will give some facts about short, sharp sentences—a remedy about which I am still doubtful about. There is no evidence to show that mere punishment on the lines of the sort of hatred poured out by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South will do the job. I want to get rid of crime and seek to reduce it as much as anybody else. But I believe that the methods advocated by the hon. Members for Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) and
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
Aberdeen, South will not do the job. There is sufficient evidence throughout the world to bear out my argument. I do not have all the answers; I have very few. We shall need to grope towards those answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to speak for a few minutes on the short, sharp sentence. All of us—and this is a psychiatric evaluation—probably have a point at which we say "I shall never do that again." But I do not know how one decides that point. For me one night in Sauchton prison would be enough, but perhaps after a fortnight I would change my mind. Many of my friends have been in concentration camps and it is amazing how the human being adapts. How does one determine that psychological point—if that is not a dirty word in this Committee with some Members—when one says" That is the crucial point. Let that lad out now and he will be all right." How do we determine these considerations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have met many who in earlier days experienced the short, sharp sentence, with everything being done at the double and with no smoking being allowed. A great deal of resentment was built up while they were in prison. They were glad that they stopped smoking while in prison but, in almost sheer defiance of the regime, the first thing they intended to do when they got out was to have a cigarette. They did that in defiance, instead of saying "Thank God, I have broken the habit." Therefore, there is no easy answer. If there were, I should jump at it. I should love to find an easy answer, but I do not believe that one exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some speeches made by Conservative Members were cheap and vote-catching. I do not know the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South well enough, but I do not believe that he is as bad as he sounded from his speech today, or from other speeches I have heard him make. The hon. Gentleman has a very slender majority and his speeches will not do him any good. He will not be back with us—at least as the Member for Aberdeen, South—after the next General Election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winifred Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being here on Tuesday. I was speaking in another Assembly. I must also disclose an interest, as I am a practitioner in Glasgow in the solicitor branch of the legal profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill. We have waited a long time for it. Some of my remarks will be specific, and I shall welcome comments on them in the winding up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the provisions which seek to prevent delay in trials. Obviously, that must lead to an improvement in the quality of the test that a trial is. Memories fade, and if a court case is delayed very much after the incident which causes it, memory is not accurate. One can easily do tests—I often do them myself—to see what the quality of my observation would be. It is not very impressive for most people. All these provisions must be welcomed by anyone who has had experience in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also very much welcome a specific provision which takes away some of the disadvantage from which the defence suffers—the right to have witnesses cited for the defence. That is an enormous improvement. Many defence cases could succeed in obtaining acquittals if only witnesses could be found. When I was a practitioner engaged in criminal practice, I applied many a time for citation of witnesses and many a refusal did I have. I think that it was a famous American judge who said that there would always be more voices in society to call "Punish the guilty" than voices to say "Let us make sure that we acquit the innocent." I might be forgiven if I concentrate on the latter, because there seem to be far more voices on the other side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may stick for the moment to the question of the disadvantage suffered by the defence, I am disappointed that we have not cured one serious disadvantage—the lack of preparation time between the first and second diets. I wonder if that point could be looked at again. It seems to be a very simple point that could be put in the Bill, and I assure the Committee that it is sometimes impossible to do a good job without more time. I am sure we all hope that both prosecution and
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
defence are conscientious in their preparation. If we want that, I can assure the Committee that the time allowed is not long enough in many cases. We have even known cases as serious as a murder case—the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fair-bairn) will agree with me—where the Crown have used the lack of time almost as a punitive way of stopping the defence having the possibility of proper preparation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties is that the defence cannot necessarily get access to the list of the Crown witnesses in time. If one is faced with a list of 140 witnesses, for example, one cannot in conscience in the short time do an efficient job for the defence. It seems to me a pity that there could not be a provision even yet added to solve the problem. There does not need to be a great extension of time. I shall welcome comments on this point from both sides in the winding-up speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to appeal and the failure of the Bill to do anything to stop the absurdity of the stated case, I hope that that can be looked at again. This is a bad aspect of Scottish law. It is a blot on the fair escutcheon of a rather good system of criminal procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already given an undertaking on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad to hear that that point has been taken already. I shall not labour it. I am sorry that the interrogation principle has been introduced into Scotland. I think it indefensible and wrong that this has been done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a member of her party, the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To some extent, that is a quibbling answer. When one appears with a client in solemn procedure, of course there is the theoretical provision of a judicial examination, and that is why the formula is used—"No plea or declaration", but the hon. and learned Member knows very well that he will hardly ever see a case when a declaration is made or where judicial examination is actually car-

	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
ried out. With all respect, I do not think that that answer was very serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should welcome a real extension or application of the judicial examination. I do not object to that, because the quality of the evidence then would not be the subject of all the arguing that takes place when evidence is obtained by policemen. It is unfair to the police that we should allow them to interrogate and extract evidence in conditions of secrecy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, if the accused is subsequently going to trial to plead not guilty, the defence is almost always put in the position of having to attack the credibility of the police officers. That is a very unpleasant kind of examination to conduct. It is not good for the police, it is not good for the defence, and I think that we shall open the door to more evidence of that kind. It will give us more trouble in the foreseeable future than if we were to make plain that suspects could not be interrogated by the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to go back to the quite permissible use of the judicial examination in a proper way by a sheriff, with the accused represented, then I do not think that anyone could quarrel with the evidence that would then be produced. Anyone who has read Ludovic Kennedy's book on the Christie case will remember that one of the nasty features there was the number of hours that this fairly stupid accused—someone not of full intelligence, if I remember—was kept in an English police station. I always thought that in Scotland, at least, we cannot interrogate the accused and we have a much fairer system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an accused is an experienced criminal, he will have the wit to keep his mouth firmly shut during the four-hour period. Two hours is surely long enough to check names and addresses, and I deplore the introduction of what I have chosen to call the interrogation principle. I take the point that we have always accepted the judicial examination, but we do not apply it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to bail money, I have read the record of the previous sitting, and it seems to me that to take away the alternative of money is to take away what can in some cases be a useful enough device. It reflects rather poorly on the opinion held by the Lord Advocate of the Bench if the argument follows the line that if there is a possibility of imposing money then it will always be imposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument was not used by me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was used by another hon. Member. I discount that argument, and I see no reason for not leaving bail money as one of the alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see the powers of punishment in the sheriff court increased. I should like to see the legal aid position for the criminal accused improved. It is not right that there is no appeal against the refusal of grant of criminal legal aid. Again one comes back to the fundamental principle of society wanting to ensure a fair trial. The moment one takes on the burden of trying to ensure fair trials, one has to be most careful of denying the right to be defended, particularly when the plea is "Not Guilty".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation of criminal legal aid is patently unsatisfactory in some sheriffdoms. It is quite fair in others. Much depends upon the attitude of the sheriff. Too much power, in my opinion, rests with him in this arena. The Law Society of Scotland has undertaken the burden of administering civil legal aid and, I understand, is prepared to undertake the burden of similarly administering criminal legal aid. It would be an onerous burden, but it would cost society nothing and I seriously ask that this be looked at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases people are deprived of a fair trial by not being legally represented due to the whimsical behaviour on the part of certain sheriffs who, not knowing how the other half lives, in many instances make pronouncements along the lines of "Save up your money to pay a lawyer", when we know perfectly well—those of us who do know how the other half lives—that such people have no hope of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see an end to that. I should like to see a proper system of financial assessment. I am not suggesting we make it easier or more available, but I do not think it would be made more available. I should like that to be looked at again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to what we have heard about giving back authority and vague remarks about the courts being in the justice business, surely, the essence must be to temper justice with mercy according to the circumstances. The moment such phrases are used by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
he immediately demeans himself and his mind by giving utterance to such vague remarks. Let him tell us what he means by giving back authority. What does he want? Does he want greater powers of punishment for the sheriff? Does he want an end to short prison sentences? Does he think that these are a waste of time? Let him make specific proposals, not the emotive phrases like "giving back, authority to the court".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat), I would point out to the hon. Lady that this is Second Reading, and no doubt my hon. Friend will develop his theory in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope he will. He owes it to his own intelligence to do so. I am quite prepared to offer practical suggestions, and I offer this to the two Front Benches. In my opinion, short prison sentences accomplish nothing very much for society. I am not a great believer in prison sentences accomplishing very much except to lock up nuisances for a period of time. Personally, I am not convinced that short prison sentences are a deterrent after the first time. I believe that a short prison sentence is a deterrent to the man who has never been in prison before, but the man who has served a prison sentence has already been stripped of his dignity, the sanction has been enforced, and he has been branded in the eyes of his friends and family as someone who has been inside. After that, I question whether it is much of a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be looking at the reformative aspects of prison. I believe, in common with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Mr. Carmichael), we could retrieve many people in prison and turn them into good citizens. But it is not the fault of the prison officers, who have a dedicated attitude towards their charges. I pay tribute to many friends in the prison service. I am amazed that we can find people to do such a difficult job with such dedication. But I believe that because of the horrors of the buildings we are not retrieving people. We have a huge recidivist incidence in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that Scotland has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
particularly violent society. It is not as violent as society in Italy. It is certainly not as violent as the society in America and many other parts of the world. In many parts of Scotland people do not lock their doors at night. In most parts of Scotland most people do not have peepholes in their doors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is to much emotionalism about crime, as if there were something drastically different, though I take the point of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South that we have to look at the horror of increased crime among the very young. That is something to which we should be directing research. It looks bad for the future if so many housebreakings are committed by such young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the court has authority. On the whole, the processes of the court deter. The courts have dignity, and if I can see some of my proposals incorporated in the Bill I feel I can give it a considerable welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has made a moderate and constructive speech. Would she, on reflection, consider that it is fair to describe clause 2 as empowering the police to interrogate when all that a suspect need do is to give his name and address?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the period of four hours that worries me. I say that with many years of exacting experience of criminal defence. I know that the police often break the rules. Anyone who pretends that they do not is naive. We almost gear our rules to make it necessary for them to do so. To have a person for four hours in a situation where he is helpless, locked up, is certainly encouraging the hours to be used for some purpose. We all know, or we can all suspect, that some of those hours will be used for the understandable motive the police have to get at the facts of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady note that in clause 2(2)(	<i>b</i>) one of the specific reasons for this four-hour period is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to enable the police to put questions to that person in relation to the offence"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is precisely what I object to. I do not think I am out of order in suggesting that we are introducing a startling new principle into the law of Scotland. I have always regarded it as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
one of the most excellent aspects of our law that if a person was genuinely a suspect he could not be interrogated. I do not see what the four-hour period is to be used for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now the modern methods of fingerprint cross-checking for identity. We have motor cars which make quick checking of addresses possible. We have telephones and all manner of things that we did not have at one time. I cannot see the purpose of holding accused people for four hours. It is not sensible. I do not think it is in the interests of the police. I am perfectly certain that many senior experienced police officers would agree with me. It is almost tantamount to encouraging the creation of the kind of evidence that will be attacked in court. More and more we shall have the suggestion put to the police, as I put it to the Committee, that evidence is extracted improperly or by force and so on. This is encouraging evidence of that kind to be on the increase, and for that reason I am against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is little that is objectionable in the Bill, and that there are many important points of detail which will undoubtedly improve criminal procedure and justice in Scotland. However, those who have said that there is little in the Bill to make a significant contribution to reducing the overall rate of crime in Scotland are justified in their view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvin-grove (Mr. Carmichael) suggested that some of my hon. Friends had exaggerated the increase in crime. The statistics show that one cannot exaggerate the seriousness of the problem even if one wishes to do so. Hon. Gentlemen object to certain of the provisions as endangering the civil liberties of the subject, but they must remember that the civil liberties of the subject include the right to freedom from crime, freedom from muggings, and freedom from serious abuses on their liberty. It is necessary to strike a balance between the legitimate requirements of the police and society and any question of endangering the liberty of the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members have referred to the desirability of reducing the prison population. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
Sproat) that the most acceptable way to reduce it is to cut the level of crime. However, there are other considerations to be borne in mind. Most hon. Members on both sides of the political divide, including my hon. Friend, will agree that it is not appropriate that drunks, for example, should swell the prison population. They are not criminals and they only impede prison officers in the proper performance of their duty. Prison statistics show that 42 per cent, of admissions to prison in the last year for which figures are available were for non-payment of fines. That clearly is also an intolerable burden on the prison service. An enormous bureaucracy is required to deal with people for whom originally the court did not envisage a prison sentence. Changes in the Bill seeking to reduce that figure are to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make a few short comments on clause 2, which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) strongly opposed. First, one must realise that at present it is not unusual for persons suspected of criminal offences to spend time in a police station.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Voluntarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says voluntarily. I suppose it is correct to say that they are invited to the police station. Very few members of the public are aware that it is voluntary and that it is possible for them to decline the invitation. The only people who are so aware are the professional criminals, or those who have been invited on numerous previous occasions and are aware of their legal rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary to say that a right should be abolished because people do not exercise it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is whether there would be a significant effect on the liberty of the individual. At the moment the vast majority of people—certainly all those who have no previously committed crimes—would attend police stations. It is normally better to regularise the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember an American lady, visiting Britain for the first time, commenting that she believed that the people of Britain were extraordinarily law-abiding. When I asked why she said that, she replied that every time a serious crime was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
committed, within a couple of days she read in the newspapers that people were assisting the police with their inquiries. The truth is that that is exactly what happens—although, strictly speaking, it is voluntarily and people can decline if they so wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden said that if the police feel that it is necessary to detain someone at the police station, that person should be arrested. That is one way in which it can be done, but the hon. Gentleman knows that the police cannot arrest a member of the public without sufficient evidence to justify an arrest. The cases in which difficulty arises are those in which the police have suspicions and believe that in the interests of justice it would be desirable to detain suspects at the police station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Moray •jnd Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) and for Garscadden concentrated their attack on the possible abuses that arise when questions are put to a suspect. However, clause 2 gives one of the main grounds for which a person may be detained at a police station—namely, where the police have reason to believe that if he was not detained at the station he might tamper with the evidence and thus impede police investigations. We know that that can happen, particularly with a professional criminal or a person who has previously committed serious offences. If such persons know that suspicion is beginning to focus upon them, they will do everything possible to destroy the evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only four hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "Only four hours," but that is the point—namely, that it is not such a massive invasion of the rights of the citizen. We are not debating a proposal to lock up people for two or three days with at access to their solicitor in order that all sorts of terrible abuses can be inflicted upon them. It is a very limited number of hours, and I do not doubt that there are many who believe that the period should be longer than four hours. However, because one needed to find a balance between the rights of the citizen and the legitimate requirements of the police, the figure of four hours was recommended by the Thomson Committee. [Hon. Mem-

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we consider the very short period that is provided for in the Bill. When the hon. Member for Garscadden says that it was a package deal that Lord Thomson's committee offered and that the proposals to allow detention in a police station were dependent on the tape recording and on the new procedure for judicial examination, he really should re-read the committee's recommendations on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Thomson committee dealt with the question of detention in a police station for several hours, it stated three general rules that should govern that detention. One was that detention should not be longer than the interests of justice required; the second was that it should be succeeded as soon as is reasonable either by release or arrest; and the third was that it should not exceed a fixed period of time. The fact that later in its report the committee made other recommendations which it did not state were in any way dependent on the earlier recommendations does not entitle the hon. Member to make the allegations which he did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that in one respect I agreed with what the hon. Member for Garscadden and others said. One of the recommendations of the Thomson committee that I should have liked to see in the Bill is that when information questions are put to an accused in a police station there should be a tape recording of the questions and of the answers given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Thomson committee went into that in some detail. It could not see any technical objection, any objection in principle or any objection for any other reason as to why it would not be appropriate. The committee commented that it might be difficult for there to be tape recording of general interrogation by police of suspects outside the police
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
station because of the non-availability of the necessary equipment. However, in a police station there should be no difficulty of that type and the recommendation would answer the legitimate concern of many hon. Members who know perfectly well that on occasion—I hope that it is only on a few occasions—questioning that goes on in a police station is not entirely consistent with the high principles that are normally complied with by the vast majority of police officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will indicate in his reply why the Government did not include the Thomson recommendation concerning the taping of questions and answers in police stations and whether they will be prepared to reconsider their initial dicision in that respect, in the light of the comments from sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a Queen's Counsel in Scotland, I declare an interest. I have had a practice which, since I have never had the benefit of the patronage of any Lord Advocate, has been restricted to the defence rather than to the prosecution. I have always had the benefit of the assistance, or perhaps I should say cooperation, of the Lord Advocate and of his advocate deputies, and of the Crown Agent and his staff, but I have never had the benefit of that patronage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a debate of immense importance. I regret greatly that we are falling into the habit of having important recommendations made to Parliament, at Parliament's request or command, and failing to put them into effect when so serious a matter as human life may be protected if such legislation is put into effect. I urge upon the Government—I should like to see it as a matter of habit—that shorter and more frequent Criminal Justice Bills would be infinitely more sensible than big Bills which, as this does, leave so much out because of the size that they reach with what they already contain. Without, I hope, being too bitter, I think that the Government have lost a great opportunity to make some absolutely essential reforms that were recommended by Thomson and others that were not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome such matters as the right of the defence to cite witnesses, or to require the procurator fiscal to cite them on his behalf. I welcome the fact that a case
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
must be brought within 12 months or not at all, because that is an extension, or a parallel to the 110-day rule. If one is in custody, one must under this Bill be brought to trial within 110 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it a sensible amendment that it be related to the start rather than the finish of the trial. I recall appearing for a gentleman who had put an axe into the pate of another citizen—it happened to be the same citizen into whom he had put an axe, for which he had served seven years—and he got out because of the technicality that his trial was not over within 110 days. That is not in the interests of justice. I do not know the origin of the figure 110 or how we came to it. I have been trying to work it out. I do not know whether any historian can tell us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the dissociation of drunks, or alcoholics, from criminals. It is said that the difference between a drunk and an alcoholic is that a drunk is a man who cannot hold his drink whereas an alcoholic is a man who cannot hold his glass. However, whatever category such people fall into, I should like to see whether we can in Committee find a better English or Scottish term for these places than "detoxification centre". That is an abominable expression. Can they not be called "drunks' bunks" or "dry houses"? Anyway, please, not "detoxification centres".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the matter of detention. There are two things that frustrate justice in Scotland. One is the silence of the guilty man, and the other is the inability of the police to disarm a man whom they do not have positive evidence is armed. I want to consider these two matters very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members are properly concerned with the rights of an accused person not to be forced to say things by torture or pressure. It is undoubtedly the fact, however, that it is vastly in the interests of a guilty person to keep his mouth shut and to sit in the dock and listen to' the evidence, so that he can give some sort of an explanation, if he comes to give evidence. It is easy for someone to sit in the dock with the intention of saying "I was never out of the house when the fight occurred"—as I heard someone say in a case last week—but when a witness says "I saw you looking at the body of the dead man"—he who would say that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
he had never been out of the house, if he goes into the witness-box will be called a liar and may not be believed. He may then say "Well, I did go out, but just to see if he was all right." It is too easy for an accused person to sit in silence and squint justice thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the origin of the caution to silence? I hope that hon. Members will think very seriously about this. The origin of the common law caution to silence in both England and Scotland arose because, before the Criminal Evidence Act 1898 in Scotland and whatever the equivalent Act was in England in 1896, the accused was not entitled to give evidence, and therefore he had to be cautioned to silence; he would never have an opportunity to enlarge on or subtract from or explain what he had said. That is well illustrated by the famous case in which Marshall Hall was defending. It was a case of infanticide in which the woman had said to a witness "How could I kill my baby?" Marshall Hall said "Did she not say 'How could I kill my baby!' One is an inquiry in anticipation of murder; the other is in exasperation at the very thought of it. That was the reason for the caution to silence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once a person is entitled to give evidence, silence frustrates justice. One knows whether one did or did not do it. One knows whether one did it in self-defence or was somewhere else and can prove alibi. The accused, the suspect, knows. Therefore I believe that we should return to the previous system in the law of Scotland whereby a person should be cautioned if he is charged with an offence to give an explanation there and then and that his failure to do so will be used in evidence to detract from any defence he may then give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, if he does not wish to give that explanation in a police station, he should be brought before a sheriff or magistrate immediately for judicial examination as to his explanation of his part in whatever events are being investigated. That would not do one whit of danger to an innocent person. It would result in the conviction of many more people who have committed serious crimes. I ask the Committee to consider that perhaps stark proposal very carefully. There is no justification for the caution to silence. It is entirely historic and is now inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter with which we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
concerned is detention. If the caution to silence was abolished, there would be no question of being asked questions in a police station under detention. That is an area of grave dispute and nothing does the law more harm, as the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) said, than the business of lawyers constantly, on the instructions of their clients, having to accuse policemen of dishonesty. The reason that policemen may force people to say things or not obey the rules is the caution to silence. I believe that it should go. It is archaic that we still have the vestigial part of the procedure where the accused, after being charged, is brought before a sheriff to say nothing. That is the vestigial procedure. He should be brought before the sheriff to give his explanation under controlled questioning, as the Thomson report recommends, and if he fails to give an explanation or gives an explanation which is different from any he gives later, that may be used in evidence at his trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal next with another power which I believe is of equal importance, the power of search. The power of search in this Bill is restricted to a policeman taking a person to a police station. I do not understand the logic of that. What is the point of taking a child from Nitshill to the central police office in Glasgow in order to see whether he has a weapon on him?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only last week in a case the following evidence occurred. A number of youths, all under 21, murdered a man and inadvertently failed to murder the son of the man they murdered. They did it with knives and bottles. The police were called to the incident out of which that case of murder and attempted murder arose. The police were told by a witness that a certain person had a knife, and in answer to my question in cross-examination—it which was not really relevant to the case but is relevant to us, and that is why I asked it—'both police officers said that they did not consider they had power on that information to arrest the person with a knife or to search him to see whether he was committing an offence under section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act. That victim would be alive today if the police had been able to search the youths on the street then and there to see whether they had a knife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Youths carry a knife or get a knife late
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
at night because it is a psycho-sexual symbol of virility. In the sub-culture of some of our vast and barren estates, it is a sign of virility. The psycho-sexual significance of the knife—if anybody wishes to read about it, it is described in "Cold Comfort Farm"—is a potent cause of the murders and attempted murders that happen so often in Scotland. I see no invasion of liberty for a policeman to come up to a person and say "Let me frisk you". It is common at airports or when people come into certain parts of this building, and I see no reason why it should not be done at Nitshill. I see no invasion of privacy—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—or, indeed, in Morningside or in Fordell Castle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. and learned Gentleman is again getting into the habit of answering questions himself. The questions will not appear on the record, I hope. Such cross-talk will not make intelligent reading. The hon. and learned Gentleman should refrain from answering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I plead guilty and hope not to go to prison. When we are dealing with crime and its causes, the factor which disturbs me most is that when I started practice about 20 years ago I rarely defended anybody who was not a mature adult, a professional at whatever crime he committed. Today one rarely sees in the High Court dock anybody who is a mature adult. Almost all the serious crimes—certainly the vast majority—are being committed by people under 21. That is the problem which we have to try to solve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the view that there are certain inevitable factors which have led to this deterioration, in the behaviour of people of that generation. They are the first television generation. Violence, fact and fiction, good and bad, right and wrong, are given equal viewing with no distinction. Second, along with that, the increase in the power of the State and the decrease in the power of the family have loosened the ties, disciplines, prides and loyalties of the family. All these are factors, but long-term solutions are needed and at present we are dealing with short-term remedies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely disturbed by the provisions in the Bill for the abolition of
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
detention centres, young offenders institutions and borstal training. We want to enlarge, not decrease, the battery of options open for sentencing. In. a prison policy—prison is not working—we should detain those who are a serious threat to society, perhaps without limit of time, perhaps for an indeterminate period until they have reached an age when the fire of passion, which seems to fizzle out about 55 according to the statistics, has passed. [Hon. Members: "Speak for yourself."] I am speaking of the fire of criminal passion. Some Labour Members may not have had any fire of passion at any age. I cannot speak for whether they have had criminal passion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that if prison is to serve a purpose it must be the initial shock that does it. Therefore, those who are not to be detained for the protection of society should serve a very short, hard time. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Mr. Carmichael) that one gets used to it in a week and does not care about it. A short, sharp sentence is very good, and when the detention centres were introduced the amount of recidivism was very little. It was then a harsher regime than it is now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how a judge or sheriff can possibly sentence if all that he can give is a length of time, without being able to anticipate in advance what view the anonymous prison committee will take on whether to give the person borstal training, detention or young offenders' institution. I think that that will be quite impossible. A sheriff will say to himself "I do not trust them to send him to a detention centre if I give him three months, so I shall give him 18 months". It will make sentencing that much more difficult and that much more wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to list a few of the matters that we should undertake in the Bill, but before doing so I shall make one more criticism on my last subject. I find it strange, when most serious crimes are caused by people under 21, that we are trying to protect that group from going to prison. Far too often the process goes: warning, warning, fine, fine, bigger fine, 10 days, 30 days, three months, and continues as with counting or going through the alphabet. Had it started with a short sharp lesson, I believe that the child might never have gone on in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
The first thing that I should like to see in the Bill is a real fixed diet. It may be better to do some things by act of adjournal, but I think that we should consider them carefully. It is quite absurd that we have a first diet in the High Court at which counsel who is to represent the accused is not present, the plea which eventually will be realistically advanced cannot be put forward, and any preliminary plea that is put forward—that the indictment is incompetent or whatever it may be—cannot be argued. The judge who tries the case is not the sheriff who hears the first diet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are recommendations by the Thomson committee to have a real first diet. Again, that is another part of our procedure that has become vestigial and ought to be revived. It would save time and mean that we did not have the farce in the Glasgow High Court, which now sits almost continually—and very often overlaps with the next circuit—that one comes on Monday when one's case is supposed to start yet it does not because an expected "not guilty" plea has not arrived. Alternatively, all the witnesses are there for trial no. 1, yet there was never any prospect of its going for trial; there was bound to be a plea of some type. The witnesses and jury have to go away and come back again the next day, so there is nothing for the court to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the pleas were adjusted at a pleading diet, before the judge who will hear the case at the first diet, that would clear the courts of a great deal of unnecessary waste of time. Second, as the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn said, it would give the defence proper time to prepare its case. It is unfair that the Crown can see all its witnesses, with the fiscal tapping his finger on the table and saying "You come in and give me a statement for three months", yet the defence is frustrated. After all, one office may have 10 cases. It may be necessary to see perhaps 1,000 people—to find them sober and at home in all the outstretched parts of a city. That is a change which I should like to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like us to say that there is no closed list of special defences and to see some safeguard on the power of each party to call one another's witnesses. That seems to me a dangerous innovation, particularly because if one
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
sits in a line one has lost one's chance once one has sat down and called one's evidence; one does not know what no. 5 will do. We must be cautious about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like us to abolish the peremptory challenge of jurors. I find it quite absurd—although I admit that I have done it myself—indeed, every time I decide who I shall have on a jury. If "Mr. William Ross (teacher)" comes up on the list I do not need even have to look round to see whether it is the right one. The fact that he is a teacher is enough—I shall not have him—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is a wise man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—because I know that he would convict. As the magistrate said, "If there had been any evidence, I would be sending you to prison as well". In a rape case, I always try to get a majority of women because women know what rape is about. They know how to resist. They know it is farcical to say that somebody is able to have intercourse when a woman is struggling and trying to stop it. Women know that. Men just think that a woman is a soft thing and will be overwhelmed. Women know that they are tough. No one could rape the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn, even if there was anyone who had a fancy to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I should like to see the abolition of peremptory challenge to jurors. I see no justification for it. It is quite wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see the announcement of the jury's majority to make sure they do not bring in a majority that is not a majority for guilty—like 5, 5 and 5. I should like to see the application for leave to appeal abolished and just have the appeal. These are all recommended by Thomson. I should like to see the judge's report available to both sides. It is very bad in an appeal that the judge is able to tell the appeal court who should win but not the appellant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Crown to be able to appeal on a point of law, not to upset a conviction but to establish a point of law which needs to be discussed and arises out of a case. I should like to see the stated case procedure reformed, and the Lord Advocate has given us that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
I should like to see the right to increase sentence in summary appeals. There is no better deterrent from frivolous appeals. Just jack up one sentence and the others quickly fade away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also I should like to see in the Bill sensible reform on the law of pardon. After the absurd situation which arose in the Meehan case, Lord Robertson's judgment stands presumably as authoritative law on what pardon means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the suggestion from the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) that the Emslie report should be put into effect. I welcome also the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cath-cart (Mr. Taylor) that vandalism should be a crime on its own. We have a manifest number of assaults. Murder is just an assault. Attempted murder is just an assault. Rape is just an assault. But they are specific assaults. I see no reason why the crime of vandalism should not be specified on a person's record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have detained the Committee long enough. I believe we can put a great deal more into the Bill than is there already, but the two matters which are most urgent, which frustrate justice and the police most and cause their difficulties—if anybody suggests they cheat, they are cheating—is, first, that they cannot search a person to see whether he has a weapon, whether or not they know he has one, and second, the caution to silence, which seems to me to be out of date and to frustrate justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one, I hope, is more jealous than I am of the rights of the individual when he is challenged by the State as to his guilt or his liberty, but I am equally conscious of the right to live and the right to go about in peace. Therefore, anything which can obtain conviction and which can frustrate crime is to be preferred. It will not interfere with the rights of the individual. It will not interfere with the rights of the innocent if we abolish the caution to silence. That does not mean that he has to go into the witness-box. But I believe a caution to explanation and the judicial examination would be a major and liberal reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Harry Ewing)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will wish me to say how grateful we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
to the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fair-bairn) for his contribution this morning, bringing with it all his own experience in his long service in the courts. I say that in all sincerity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I openly admit that many of the things that the hon. and learned Gentleman has asked should be included in the Bill, recommended by Lord Thomson and various other committees, are not included there simply because we feel we ought to do what we think we are able to do at this stage and not be too ambitious. But I accept the criticism that has been levelled on that score. I repeat that many of the things not in the Bill are not in for precisely that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it abundantly clear at the outset that the Government consider the fight against crime to be of the highest priority. I want that to be absolutely understood, because as the debate has proceeded, both on Tuesday and this morning, the Opposition—I exclude the SNP Members who spoke—sought to give the impression they are anti-crime and that the Government are pro-crime. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow Cath-cart (Mr. Taylor) and his hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat), and many other hon. Members, laid great stress on the drastic increase in crime during 1977. It is true that the report on crime statistics was late and should have been published in June. The reason it could not be published in June was that we discovered errors in the returns made by the police. No one would want false statistics published. Once these errors had been corrected, we ran into printing difficulties, There were, therefore, legitimate reasons why the crime statistics were delayed, and none of the sinister reasons suggested by the hon. Member for Cathcart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first three-quarters of this year all crime in Scotland had gone down by 6.3 per cent. I do not want to place too much emphasis on figures for nine months, because the year is not yet over and we must analyse all the returns, but it is a welcome sign that crime is declining. That particularly applies in the area that has given the greatest cause for concern to the Committee, namely, vandalism and so on. I must caution the Committee that there has been an increase in the first nine months in serious offences,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
though not in crimes against property, although there is a welcome downturn sign in the crime pattern over the past 10 years that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South referred to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the role of the police. The hon. Member for Cathcart was less than fair both to the Government—I do not complain about that, because that is in character—and to the police. Far from police morale being low in Scotland, in the four years I have been in this job I have never known police morale to be as high as it is now. We now have a greater number of policemen in Scotland than ever before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have a better equipped police force than ever before, which is more technically able to combat crime. For the first time ever we have been able to stem the wastage of policemen. In Strathclyde—an area in which the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray), who I am sorry is not with us at the moment, made the point that the 1961 and 1963 Criminal Justice Acts merely led to an increase in crime. They were Acts brought in by a Conservative Government, and the hon. Member was complaining that those two Acts led to an increase in crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lest there be an indication that the Minister might be giving an impression that there can be complacency, would he not agree that, despite a dramatic rise in crime, we had a situation in the United Kingdom two years ago where the number of police resignations were the highest ever recorded?

While we are delighted at the increase, because of Edmund-Davies, there was a very serious situation two years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The position in Scotland at the moment is exactly as I have given it. We have been able to stop the resignations. Indeed, one of the redeeming features of the past two or three months has been the number of police officers who have been out of the force for a year or under and have made application to re-join, so we are getting many experienced officers coming back into the force. Morale in the police force is high-

	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
er than I have ever known it, and I have a very close relationship with all the police associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was raised about the detention powers under clauses 1 and 2. The Government considered the Thomson proposal for a six-hour detention period. The SNP Members and other hon. Members have suggested throughout the debate that the six-hour period should be two hours. We did not anticipate that a two-hour period would be suggested. That was not what made us come up with a compromise suggestion of four hours, but the Government considered that it was right and proper to get a balance between the needs of the police force to pursue their rightful duties in trying to apprehend criminals and prevent crime and the proper rights of the citizen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one thing that has not been mentioned on the question of detention for four hours is the other aspect of the purpose for detention. It is not only true to say that it is to prove that someone was involved in a crime. One of the purposes is to prove, if possible, and if it be the case, that someone was not involved in the crime. The purpose of proving innocence is much more important, in my view, than the purpose of proving guilt. For that reason, the Government came down in favour of a four-hour detention period. We are convinced that with proper and expert police practices, there will be no abuse of this power that we intend to give in clauses 1 and 2. Obviously, this will be a matter for detailed debate as we go into Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire spoke of stop-and-search powers. This power in clauses 1 and 2 ought not to be confused with the Thomson proposal for stop-and-search powers. Stop-and-search powers are not in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart made great play of the fact that the Thomson proposal was a package. With respect, I thought that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) dealt with that. Even if the Thomson proposals on tape-recorded evidence, judicial examination, powers of detention and stop-and-search powers were accurate, it does not mean that the package is indivisible. We can easily—this has been the case in so many aspects of policy—take parts from a package and come up
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
with a good legislative proposal. My view is that this is what happened in putting together the drafting of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The admissibility of evidence was another aspect of the problem. One purpose of the limited power of detention conferred by clause 2 is to enable the police to ask questions of a person who is suspected of having committed an imprisonable offence. Such questions may be appropriate to allow the police to continue the speedy and efficient investigation of the crime in question, for example, to discover the whereabouts of the suspect's known associates, to check on the suspect's previous movements and to recover stolen property or a weapon which is being sought. Powers may also be necessary to allow the police to confirm by further immediate investigation their suspicion as to the suspect's connection with the crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both those aspects of questioning are at present part of current police practice and the purpose of the clause is to regularise what happens now. The clause does not make changes in the present law relating to the admissibility at his or her trial of answers given by a suspect in response to police questions. Therefore, I hold that that clears the point on the admissibility of evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, as he was good enough hot to interrupt me. The law, as I understand it—perhaps the Lord Advocate will correct me—is that once a person becomes a suspect no further questions are admissible. That is my understanding of H.M. Advocate v. Chalmers. If I have misunderstood the law for so long, perhaps I may now be corrected. That is the major change which the Bill proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. It is very important at this stage in our proceedings to define clearly the problem about the admissibility of evidence.

I turn now to a side-issue, the question of prisons and prison population. The hon. Member for Cathcart spoke about the cut-back in expenditure. We have not been able to do as much as we should have liked in providing better accommodation for prison officers whilst working, which must mean as a consequence better conditions for prisoners, but we have been able to do something. Under phase one of the new Shotts prison the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
new laundry has been built and is in operation. The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Reid) knows that he has the new Glenochil institution in his constituency, including a detention centre providing nearly 700 places between the young offenders and the detention centre combined. There is also the new women's prison at Cornton Vale. At the moment we are rebuilding the old prison for women at Greenock. Various other minor modernisation schemes are going on. It is not accurate to say that nothing has happened, but the hon. Member for Cathcart tries to give the impression that nothing is happening in providing better prison accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn quickly to the question of money bail, to which the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) and others referred. Thomson was clear on the question of bail conditions. In his report Thomson makes clear that he thinks, and we agree, that bail conditions are much better than money bail. The accused person, on being released on bail conditions, will be given a statement of the conditions on which he is being released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that one condition is that the person should surrender his passport or that he should report to a police station every so often. There is a whole host of bail conditions which could be attached to a person being released on bail. My view is that the bail conditions will be much more effective and give a better guarantee, if that is possible, of the offender appearing when his court appearance is due. Money bail has not been successful in this respect, and we feel that moving to bail conditions will be much more successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point made by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn was about the time between the first and second appearance on an indictable offence and giving time to defence counsel to prepare the defence. That is dealt within schedule 4, in" which the time has been extended from six days to 19 days in order to give more time for preparation. If the hon. Lady consults schedule 4 she will see that the point has been dealt with adequately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the wholly suspended sentence was raised extensively on Tuesday. Our reason for not going for wholly suspended sentences is that here in England and Wales there is a policy of
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
wholly suspended sentences which has not been successful. The temptation before the court in sentencing an offender is to say that the offender will be sentenced to a year but that the sentence is suspended, but then, lo and behold, the offender commits another offence. Although the year's suspended sentence was passed in order to deter the offender from committing another offence, it has not worked. England and Wales are finding that many more people are entering prison as a direct result of the wholly suspended sentence than would otherwise have been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have gone for a part-suspended sentence under which the offender will serve part of the sentence and the other part will be held in suspense, which we feel is a much better approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the police and their authority to taken drunken people to what we call "places designated by the Secretary of State", I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire on the name. The title 'detoxification centre "is not a good name for these establishments. I have been given a very nice brochure today by the Salvation Army. The brochure describes the 256 men admitted to its programme last year as being "admitted to the alcoholic rehabilitation programme". I think that is a much better approach than calling these places detoxification centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But clause 4 merely gives power to the police to take a drunken person to a place which will be designated by the Secretary of State. If the question is asked—What kind of place will be designated?—the answer is, a place where the Secretary of State is satisfied that there is adequate social work support, adequate medical coverage and adequate facilities generally for these persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not necessarily a State facility. We have had talks with voluntary organisations and with various other groups of people, and clearly there is a great area for co-operation between the public bodies and the voluntary bodies, to which I want to pay tribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to making resources available, at present this could be covered by the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. It could be covered also under the urban renewal programme and, as the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) knows, there is an institution to be set up in his constituency which will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
be wholly funded by central Government funds for the purpose of rehabilitating drunken people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also been looking at the possibility of funding joint funding projects between area health boards, which are totally responsible for dealing with their own priorities, and the social work departments. At present, the Strathclyde regional council and the Greater Glasgow health board are examining the possibility of setting up such a centre in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Emslie committee on murder penalties has been discussed extensively. The reason that the Government have not seen fit at this stage to accept the Emslie proposals was clearly explained by my right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) when he was Secretary of State in a Written Answer given in 1977. My right hon. Friend the present Secretary of State has also explained the reasons why we do not think the Emslie committee proposals would be acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the youth institutions can best be answered by saying that there will be different regimes within the youth institutions. All the present institutions—the borstals, young offenders institutions and detention centres—will become known as "youth institutions" under the new legislation. But they will not all have the same regime. Once a youngster has been sentenced by the court to a determinate sentence—the indeterminate sentence will not apply as there will be no more indeterminate sentences—it will be for the assessment centre to allocate that youngster to an institution. We envisage an assessment centre at the Pol-mont institution. The assessment centre is where the youngster will go first to be assessed and then be allocated to one or other of the youth institutions. But each will have a separate and different regime, and the youngster will be allocated to that kind of regime which best suits him.

If I thought for a moment that it was easy to get a statutory definition that covered vandalism and therefore create a crime of vandalism I should be attracted to the idea, but that is not possible. The kind of acts of wilful vandalism that occur could not be covered in any circumstances by one statutory definition. It is better to give the courts the flexibility they have at the moment on prosecuting what people describe as crimes of
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
vandalism under malicious damage offences. That is best left as it is.

The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) started this morning by threatening us with an election. I do not think we shall have one yet, but should we have an election I forecast that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) would stomp the country on his usual bandwagon telling us about fining, searching and all the rest of it. I think it is unfair the way that the press misrepresent the hon. Member for Cathcart, because he is not really the hard man that he presents himself to be. Constituents who visit the hon. Member are not turned away and told "Your husband deserves all he gets", "Your brother deserves all he gets", or "Your boyfriend deserves all he gets". The hon. Member writes to me and asks me whether there is anything I can do to help. He is so interested, in helping people of this kind that he even writes to me about people who are not his constituents. Far from being the hard man that he presents himself to be, he is really just a wee softie at heart. I have been describing him lately as the "Kleenex tissue" of the Tory Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that the Press have painted an unfortunate picture of a man who really has a kind heart and does not have the hard approach to criminals which is the impression that he seems to give. I know that his problem is that he has to compete with the glasshouse attitude of his right hon. Friend, he has to compete with the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South—by heaven, that is some competition—and he has to compete with various other people as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the hon. Gentleman's problem. But, just in case there is an election, I want the people of Scotland to know that at heart the hon. Member for Cathcart is just a wee softie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
