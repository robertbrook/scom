FISHING BOATS (FAROE ISLANDS) DESIGNATION ORDER 1979</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.40 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Fishing Boats (Faroe Islands) Designation Order 1979 (S.I. No. 256).</p></blockquote>
I must apologise to the Committee, for my late arrival, Miss Fookes, because I had a notice when I was selected for this Committee which had stamped over it the word "cancelled". My secretary telephoned me on Monday to that effect, and I spoke to the Minister of State this morning saying that I did not think that the Committee would take place. I seem to have been misinformed and offer my apologies.</span></p>
<p>10.41 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The order before the Committee today is very narrow, and I am sure you, Miss Fookes, would draw my attention to order if I were to go beyond its bounds. It relates to interim arrangements for fishing by Faroese vessels in United Kingdom waters. It is precisely the same in form as the Fishing Boats (Faroe Islands) Designation (No. 4) Order 1978. The sole difference is in the duration of the order.<br><br>
The latter order was discussed in Standing Committee on 24 January 1979. As I explained to the Committee at that time, the intention of the order was to give effect to a Community agreement that arrangements for reciprocal fishing with third countries should be rolled forward for two months from the end of 1978. Thus, the Faroese were allowed to fish in United Kingdom waters until 28 February 1979 on the same basis as they had fished in 1978 but taking account of the revised total allowable catches. In the case of Norway, Sweden and Spain, the 1978 designation orders had not been subject to a specific time limit and therefore did not require extension.<br><br>
We had hoped at that stage that fishing agreements with third countries for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
1979 might be finalised sufficiently early for us to be able to lay consolidated orders before the House by the beginning of March. In the event, this assessment proved too optimistic, and the Council of Fisheries Ministers meeting in Brussels on 19 and 20 February agreed that 1978 arrangements should be rolled forward for a further month until the end of March. The 1979 designation order therefore has the sole purpose of substituting the expiry, date of 31 March for that of 28 February.<br><br>
Having dealt with the interim situation, it may be of some assistance to hon. Members if I now say a few words about the EEC—Faroese agreement for 1979 which will supersede the measures in force during the first three months of this year. Negotiations between the Commission and the Faroese were completed at the end of February. The outcome was disappointing in a number of respects. In particular, there has been a further reduction in Community quotas of cod and haddock, the species in which the United Kingdom is most interested. Only 5,000 tonnes of these species will be available as against 7,000 tonnes last year. But almost all of this will be allocated to the United Kingdom. The reduction in the amount of saithe, a species in which we also have a substantial interest, is even more severe.<br><br>
Despite these reductions the Government would be reluctant to forfeit the available fishing opportunities off Faroes, which offer access to relatively scarce white fish resources, unless they had to be purchased at too great a cost. The price for our access to Faroese waters has been the offer of reciprocal opportunities for Faroese fishermen in waters under the jurisdiction of the EEC member States. It is important to note, however, that a significant proportion of the most valuable quotas are fished in Danish waters and the majority of the quotas offered in United Kingdom waters are of low-value industrial species.<br><br>
The most valuable offer from waters around the United Kingdom is of mackerel. The Faroese will be able to fish 10,000 tonnes in the North Sea and 30,000 tonnes off the West of Scotland. This represents a significant quantity of an increasingly important species, but again it is important to bear in mind that, if Faroese fishing were to cease, not all the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0578">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
mackerel the Faroese might otherwise have taken would be taken by British fishermen. The French and German fishermen, who would lose substantial fishing opportunites at Faroe, might divert to fishing this stock more heavily.<br><br>
That is an important point, that this is to our advantage. It is in the interest of both the EEC in general and the United Kingdom to relieve pressure on the waters round our coasts by seeking opportunities for catching white fish in distant waters. In this context the agreement with the Faroes has a contribution to make even though it is not as advantageous as we would have wished.<br><br>
After those few words of explanation I will deal with any questions which arise.</span></p>
<p>10.46 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Miss Fookes, for calling me on the last meeting on fishing matters of this Parliament. It is almost an end of term get-together to discuss outstanding matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Torney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where is the champagne?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Torney) is offering to provide champagne. No doubt you would rule that out of order, Miss Fookes, and say that it will have to wait until a more appropriate time.<br><br>
We are glad to see the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) here to represent the Scottish Office. Fishing connected with the Faroes has been of great concern to the Scottish industry for a long time.<br><br>
I find myself in difficulty with this order, as I have with previous orders, in that we get these orders independently off a total structure. Often it is difficult to relate them—although the Minister has tried to some extent this morning— to an overall pattern.<br><br>
We were all rather depressed when the Minister said that there has been no real advance in making final fishing arrangements for 1979 and that we are staggering on on a month-to-month basis with the 1978 arrangements. Perhaps the Minister will give us a little more information on how discussions are proceeding and when the fishing industry can expect to see more definite arrangements for 1979. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
are now in the fourth month of the year and even in the Common Market one would have expected that we might by now have come somewhere near a definite arrangement for 1979.<br><br>
The Minister gave us some figures. It would be useful if, in future, the Explanatory Note attached to orders of this kind included an estimate of the effect on the industry of such an order quantified in terms of the amount and value of the fish. The Minister pointed out, quite rightly, that we would get opportunities for white fish in Faroese waters. I think that it would be possible to estimate monetary value as well as an estimate of the quantities, so that we could weigh up the value of such a deal on a reciprocal basis and ask how much we would be paying out and what quantities of the species would we be allowing to the Faroese boats compared to the opportunities in return for our boats in terms of quantity and value. It would make it easier to evaluate such orders if we could see in the Explanatory Note what we were giving away and what we were getting in return. This is a quid pro quo, as the Minister pointed out.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned that Faroese boats will be allowed to take 10,000 tonnes of mackerel from the North Sea and 30,000 tonnes off the West coast of Scotland—if I have the figures wrong I will gladly give way to be corrected. Does he think that Cornwall is off the West coast of Scotland and will Faroese boats be allowed to fish off Cornwall?<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will know that our fishermen are concerned that they were required to discontinue fishing off Cornwall on 10 March on conservation grounds. Forty to fifty boats belonging to constituents of mine were involved in this and have had to seek fresh opportunities, but to their amazement they see EEC boats continuing to fish off Cornwall without, it would seem, even the minimum of supervision over the quantities and quality of catch.<br><br>
The <i>Fishing News</i> last week referred to mini-sized mackerel being landed by foreign vessels in our ports, which is a very serious matter. I have written to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on this but naturally have not yet had a reply from him. I wonder whether the Minister could give us some enlightenment on this this morning and let us
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0579">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
know what arrangement there will be for ensuring that there is fair play for our boats in terms of controlling what foreign boats are taking. I hope that he can give us some assurances on what is being done to ensure that the Faroese boats will be adequately policed and whether these quantities are purely figments of the Minister's imagination—figments of everyone's imagination—or real quantities which are effectively controlled.<br><br>
That is an assurance we desperately need and one that the fishing industry feels has not yet been given by the Government in any realistic form. It is the Achilles heel of any order of this kind. It is all very well to say that the Faroese will be allowed to take 10,000 tonnes of fish out of the North Sea. With respect to the Minister, who is checking that they have taken 10,000 tonnes and not 100,000 tonnes? I hope that we shall hear a more robust statement of Government policy than we have had so far.<br><br>
If the Faroese are being given these facilities in our waters, it may represent —particularly in the case of mackerel—a reduction in opportunities for our own boats. It may not be easy for boats fishing for mackerel to change to white fish and fish off the Faroes. I want to ask the Minister what alternatives he holds out for our boats which will not be able to take the quota that is given to the Faroese boats.<br><br>
I must tell him that there is a strong suspicion that this order, and others like it, are a method which the Government are using to bring about a restructuring of the fleet. The Minister knows that the White Fish Authority has been preparing a report on the possible restructuring of the fleet over the next few years. Many fishermen believe that this restructuring is going on at the moment in the way that these orders are being implemented and that the Government will force many boats out of business by not giving them the fishing opportunities they need. The Minister will know too, that the White Fish Authority itself—not by its own volition but because it does not have funds—is not able to give grants for the building of new boats because there is no money in the kitty.<br><br>
In my constituency a skipper asked to replace a 15-year-old boat which fell into category 2 of the White Fish
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Authority's scale of priorities. Category 1 covers a boat that has been lost completely; category 2 covers a boat that is 10 years old or more. In normal times the request for replacement would have been fair and legitimate. The request has been turned down because there are no funds in the White Fish Authority's bank account to pay out grants.<br><br>
If the Minister is saying that this is the Government's way of restructuring the fleet I think that he should come out into the open and say so. He should be honest and say "We are not going to give the White Fish Authority money because we want to restructure the fleet and this is one of the ways in which we can do it." If we are talking of restructuring the fleet I should have thought that there were better ways than that. I hope that we can have an assurance from the Minister that the restructuring is not being done by the back door by cutting off funds to the White Fish Authority.<br><br>
The order is necessary because of our position on the common fisheries policy. As the Minister rightly said, if the Faroese did not get these fish no doubt the French and other Common Market countries would.<br><br>
It might be appropriate, on the closing day of this Parliament, if the Minister were able to say how he sees the common fisheries policy negotiations proceeding and to give us the assurance that no final agreement will be reached until the new Parliament assembles.</span></p>
<p>10.55 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make a short intervention in support of my hon. Friend, if I may call him that, the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson). I apologise for being late and perhaps it is a little cheeky for me to intervene as I did not hear the beginning of the hon. Member's speech. But I heard what he said about fishing at the south-west peninsula. As he continued I got the hang of his speech. I saw the article in <i>Fishing News,</i> as he had. The Secretary of State came to Hull more than a fortnight ago to attend our international conference in the presence of Mr. Gundelach. He went down to the dock in my constituency and saw skippers such as Dick Taylor and others. These men had been fishing off the south-west peninsula and when the whistle blew on 10 March they got out. Being English,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0580">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Welsh or Scots, and being honest and honourable men, they would not fish beyond the date.<br><br>
But what narked skipper Taylor and other home men, who were well known in the past for their stand in the cod war off Iceland, was that they could see the Dutch steaming in almost on their heels. I have spoken about this matter to the Under-Secretary of State for Defence for the Royal Navy. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food can talk until he is blue in the face about conservation, but unless there is enforcement against these people the whole scheme is a mockery. It is just a false shilbboleth, to talk about conserving our stocks if alien fleets are allowed to fish as soon as our men leave.<br><br>
I do not know what distance they are fishing off the coast, but I should like the Minister to explain what we are doing in this matter. It makes no sense to fishermen from Yorkshire, Humberside, Scotland or anywhere else to be told by their Minister to get out for the sake of future stocks and to see others coming in to make a nonsense of the whole exercise.<br><br>
There is no equity or natural justice. It is most unfair and our people feel that they are getting the dirty end of the stick. I should like the Minister to say something about this because it affects what were Hull distant water boats which used to fish there but which have pulled out because they have played the game. But other people apparently cannot play the game, whether they are Gaullist or some of the people we think most highly of in the EEC, such as the Dutch. They are much closer to us in culture and behaviour than are certain other members of the Community.</span></p>
<p>10.58 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamish Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not range as widely as my colleague the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson). This is a very doubtful deal.<br><br>
The order says that, in return for 5,000 tonnes of cod the Faroese can come into our water to take some 40,000 tonnes of mackerel. I fully realise that Her Majesty's Government are a bit tender on discussions with other nations. We all look back with some horror at the mishandling of the Icelandic negotiations. We doubt whether we have been as strong
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
as we should have been in our negotiations with Norway.<br><br>
To get 5,000 tonnes of cod the boats from Aberdeen have to put up with much harassment from the Faroese authorities.<br><br>
The Faroese have been less than fair in their dealings with the Aberdeen boats. They board a boat one day and allow the nets to pass the regulations, whereas on the next day the nets fail to pass the regulations and are confiscated or the boat may be taken into harbour and the catch confiscated. We have a ridiculous situation in regard to 5,000 tonnes of cod. It is 5,000 tonnes, not 5,010 tonnes. Indeed, it may be something less than 5,000 tonnes. The Faroese make sure that the Aberdeen boats never exceed the quota. I hope that Her Majesty's Government will see to it that the Faroese do not exceed their quota of 40,000 tonnes, generous as it seems to be.<br><br>
I turn now to the situation which may occur in a year's time—let us hope that it will be less than that—when we see a return to a slight amount of herring fishing in our waters. In other words, the quid pro quo will be not necessarily mackerel, but herring when herring fishing starts again. Are we to see a ridiculous amount of herring—40,000 tonnes— given away in return for about 5,000 tonnes of cod? Will it be a more realistic figure? Will it be tonne for tonne?<br><br>
I am concerned that the policing of Faroese and other vessels is not nearly strict enough. We have had about five years of constant shouting in this Parliament to get a better fishery protection service for ourselves and to get Her Majesty's Government to stand up for British fishermen. They seem to have failed to do that all the time. I know that the position is improving, but we have a long way to go in properly protecting our fishing interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, like myself, listened to the defence debate. To be fair, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence for the Royal Navy gave us figures. He said that there had been 1,600 boardings and that about 30 vessels had been hauled into port. The Under-Secretary is doing his best. I am certain that the new class of vessel that has been ordered will improve matters. Does the hon. Gentleman feel that the situation is so hopeless? Does he not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0581">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
think that there has been some amelioration? Is it not sufficient to suit him?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a bit more optimistic than I was, but I am still far from satisfied. I understand that there are instances when Navy men go aboard foreign vessels and do not know exactly what they are looking for. That is a pity, because it demeans our men in the eyes of foreign fishermen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Hugh D. Brown)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interfere but the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Watt) and his hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) keep making unspecified allegations. There are no members of the press here, so I do not suppose that it matters. Nevertheless, the allegations are most unfair. Can the hon. Gentleman give us chapter and verse of Navy boardings when the men did not know what they were looking for?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be extremely difficult to prove to the satisfaction of the Under-Secretary of State that the Navy men did not know what they were looking for.<br><br>
I was about to say that it would still be better if the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had inspectors aboard these vessels. In that way we could be quite certain that the job was being done properly. I should have thought that during the last five years the Under-Secretary would have had sufficient letters from me not to seek to encourage me to continue for the next five years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not be here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: However, if he wants chapter and verse on such matters, he will most certainly get it.<br><br>
My final point is that we need a concise and exact fishing policy so that we all know where we stand. We need to know what tonnage of fish can be taken, whether the tonnage is there, and by which boats it can be taken. We cannot allow the present free-for-all to continue. It is ridiculous to see foreign vessels, particularly pursers, being bought from Denmark and Norway to step up the size of the catching fleet when we are not stepping up the size of the possible catch. The fishing industry will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
go through an extremely lean time unless we have a sensible licensing policy.</span></p>
<p>11.04 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that one of the idiosyncrasies of this order is that it expired on 31 March, and it is now 4 April. I am still not certain from what the Minister said whether he is talking about the reciprocity between the amount of cod and haddock which we are allowed to catch, and the amount of mackerel which can be caught. Does this mean that the Minister will have to lay yet a further order to extend this order again for a period of months? It is obviously unsatisfactory to work on such a hand to mouth basis. We have discussed that point in Committees previously. I hope that after the general election it will be possible for whoever is in charge of the fisheries policy of the United Kingdom to try to get a much longer-term arrangement.<br><br>
I should like to reinforce what has been said by several hon. Members about fishermen from other countries continuing to fish for mackerel when our own fishermen have been debarred from such fishing. I thought that the whole essence of any regulation to safeguard stocks was that it should be completely unilateral and should cover all fishermen. If it is necessary to protect mackerel stocks by withdrawing our fishermen, then surely all fishermen must be withdrawn, or what point is there in our making the regulation?<br><br>
In two of the ICES areas mentioned in Schedule 2—areas IV and VIA—fishing for Norway pout is allowed. What is now the position with the EEC, concerning the legality of the pout box that we have established? Is it still in dispute with the EEC, and subject to any ruling from the European Court?<br><br>
I apologise again, that through some fault of mine, the start of the proceedings of this Committee was delayed.</span></p>
<p>11.07 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have the acknowledgement of the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour). Although his party laid the prayer against this order, my party mainly gave the Committee the opportunity of a debate. We feel that such a debate is useful, as other hon. Members will appreciate. Also, the Government have stressed the importance

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
of this occasion by the presence of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who is always willing to back the interests of the United Kingdom fishermen generally, and the Scottish fishermen in particular.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) said that we should get out the champagne this morning. But we do not want champagne. We want water—an access to more water than ever before—because waters provide our fishermen with their livelihood.<br><br>
Over the years we have been pressing the Community very hard to try to reverse some of the damage which was done before we took over. We have been trying to ensure maximum access to our waters by our fishermen, and, failing that, better access to other waters. That is the essence of the matter which we are discussing today. Although we have made some progress, we have not made all the progress that we had hoped. But my right hon. Friend the Minister cannot be accused in some places—and I am not sure if anyone here is accusing him—of not doing enough in Brussels, and elsewhere of taking too hard a stand and upsetting relationships. But he has the whole industry behind him and, I am sure, the support of all parties in this House.<br><br>
But today, as the hon. Member for Fife, East said, we are concerned with a rather small order, insofar as it is an extension for the month of March. The time until the end of the year is covered by the new EEC-Faroese agreement. There are some advantages in that, to which I may refer later. We feel that this is the best deal that we can obtain in the circumstances. It is a matter, not of getting the ideal, but of getting the best for our fishermen.<br><br>
This agreement with the Faroes covers the whole year—it is not a short-term agreement—as does the agreement with Norway, Sweden and Spain. It has the approval of the Council of Ministers and has been given effect by regulations. As the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East and the hon. Member for Fife, East have pointed out, a further United Kingdom order will be necessary and will be made as soon as possible. I look forward to the occasion when some of us can meet here again and can proceed with that good work.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
I turn briefly to other third country fishing opportunities. The Community and Norway have reached agreement on reciprocal fishing arrangements for the whole of this year. Both sides quotas are reduced compared with 1978, mainly because of the poor state of certain key stocks such as Arctic cod. The United Kingdom will obtain 34,000 tonnes of cod and haddock at northern Norway this year, compared with 41,700 tonnes last year. We have slightly improved our share of the Community quota, even though the absolute quantity is reduced. This is an important point when we talk about figures being lower.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East referred to putting more in the Explanatory Note. It would be difficult to do so unless it was part of an agreement. We have to look at our position relative to that of others. Even though the quantities may be less, if we have a bigger share of a smaller quantity which is to be shared by the whole Community, we are not doing too badly.<br><br>
The Norwegian agreement also covers the division of North Sea stocks shared between Norwegian waters and member States' waters. The larger part of the total allowable catches is allocated to the Community. In the Norwegian sector our fishermen should be able to pursue their traditional activities.<br><br>
Agreement has been reached with the Faroes on reciprocal quotas for 1979. They are somewhat disappointing in that the quotas of cod, haddock and saithe, which are of particular interest to the United Kingdom, have all been reduced.<br><br>
Despite the reductions in the Community quotas at the Faroes, the Government have decided not to block the agreement negotiated by the Commission. In reaching that decision, the Government have taken account of the fact that a large part of the quotas offered to the Faroese is in waters outside the British fishery limits. A considerable quantity also consists of low-value industrial species. The opportunity to fish for cod and haddock at the Faroes is of considerable value to particular sectors of the United Kingdom fleet. That applies especially to the Scottish sector and, notably, the middle water trawlers based at Aberdeen.<br><br>
Reference has been made to Iceland. That belongs to history. The negotiations
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0583">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
were taken over by the Community. There has been no recent change in the situation. The Icelanders remain unwilling to offer the Community access to their fishing grounds.<br><br>
I shall do a Cook's tour of the fishing scene in third countries for the benefit of hon. Members. With Spain, fishing by Spanish vessels in member States waters is being progressively reduced to the low level justified by reciprocal arrangements. In 1979, the number of standard vessel licences issued for hake fishing will be 200 compared with 240 in the last three months of 1978. The Spaniards have, however, been allowed to carry over part of the last year's hake quota which they failed to catch, as an addition to this year's quota. The fisheries implications of Spain's possible accession to the Community will be a matter for discussion during the accession negotiations. As for Sweden, the Swedish vessels have only small quotas in the North Sea and west of Scotland—1,600 tonnes of demersal species, 3,750 tonnes of mackerel plus sprat and blue whiting. This is part of a reciprocal deal which benefits Danish and German fishermen, thereby helping to divert some of their effort away from British waters. That factor must be taken into account and one cannot put it in detail into explanatory memoranda.<br><br>
With regard to the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic and Poland, fishing in member States waters by these countries' vessels was ended in 1977 following abortive negotiations. Up to now there have been no further developments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Watt) spoke about harassment at the Faroes. We have been aware of complaints from our fishermen that the Faroese enforcement has been unduly rigorous. The EEC-Faroes working group, including United Kingdom representatives, is meeting today to discuss the problem. We have made it clear that we expect some improvement in the situation this year, and in the very near future.<br><br>
I have dealt with the matter raised by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East about the balance of advantage to the United Kingodm at the Faroes. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
United Kingdom has gained from the Faroes a quota of cod and haddock of almost 5,000 tonnes and has also secured 4,000 tonnes of the Community quota of saithe. These high value white fish are paid for mainly in mackerel and lower value industrial species.<br><br>
On balance, we feel that the deal was the best we could have negotiated. Overall the Community has secured 32,000 tonnes of high-value demersal species at the Faroes, plus 30,000 tonnes of blue whiting.<br><br>
Enforcement has been raised by hon. Members. The Scottish fisheries organisations are known to have written to my hon. Friends the Scottish Ministers, as reported in the press. Our inspectorate are cross-checking the allegations that foreign vessels are catching large amounts of small mackerel. We have a fisheries protection vessel in the area and are making special efforts to police the 12-mile limit within which foreign fishing for mackerel is prohibited. I refer to mackerel in the south-west particularly, where the Scottish fishermen are also concerned.<br><br>
Norwegian vessels fishing for mackerel off the south-west are subject to a quota of 35,000 tonnes, granted to Norway by the Community. We have no evidence to suggest that the Norwegians are exceeding their quota.<br><br>
We are monitoring foreign fishing very closely indeed and are seeking to assess the size of the fish being caught. The Government will make representations if it is seen that the Norwegians are not respecting their western mackerel quota or if other member States do not have regard to the standstill agreement. It is the Government's objective that the United Kingdom should catch a reasonable share of the TAC and in the CFP negotiations the Government are working for arrangements which will ensure that other member States' fishing of the stock also bears a reasonable relationship to the TAC.<br><br>
I should stress that no foreign fishing for mackered is permitted within 12 miles of the south-west. Our fishery protection forces are making a special effort to police those regulations. We should bear it in mind that the Government are very concerned about enforcement. It is

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
a matter of concern to hon. Members and the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister of State telling the Committee that, off the coast of Cornwall, within a belt of, say, six miles or 12 miles, when our men have left, we are preventing Dutch or any other vessels from fishing for mackerel in those waters? Is that the position? Our people do not seem to think so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite clear what my hon. Friend has in mind. What I said was that the existing agreement and quotas are being enforced as stringently as possible. We are using our inspectorate in order to check on the allegations that have been made by the Scottish press and by Mrs. Lawry and others in the south-west.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that this is important. I have talked to our skippers —I mentioned Skipper Dick Taylor earlier—and I understand that our men left those waters, in totality, on 10 March. From listening to our people in Hull, it appears that the Dutch in particular, and others, simply steamed in and caught fish, whether within the six-mile belt, the 12-mile belt or whatever it may be. I imagine that the Cornishmen, line fishers or not, would have a lot to say about that if they were here. Is the Minister able to repeat that no Dutch vessels, or, indeed, any other vessels, are fishing there since our men have left? Conservation is so important, and it is argued that, if we stop fishing, we shall build up stocks for two years or four years' time, as the case may be. It is important to assure people about this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I can do is to assure my hon. Friend that no third country is fishing inside the 12-mile limit off Cornwall. That is what I have just said. Some member States may have historic rights but that would need to be checked. I shall check my hon. Friend's complaints from <i>Hansard</i> and write to him, if that would be helpful.<br><br>
Perhaps I can say a little more about the south-western mackerel fishery. As I say, we have been closely monitoring the progress of the fishery, and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea recommended a TAC for 1979 of 435,000 tonnes from this fishery. In the light of the level of catches in the first six weeks of 1979 and bearing in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
mind the requirements of the further phases of the fishery off the west coast of Scotland in the summer and off the south-west coast of England at the end of the year, my right hon. Friend announced on 23 February that fishing for mackerel by vessels subject to the mackerel licensing scheme would be suspended from 10 March to 2 June—the period with which we are concerned. Hand liners and vessels of less than 40 ft. registered length are not subject to licensing and are able to continue fishing for mackerel.<br><br>
I hope that those comments will give some reassurance. We shall keep the matter very much in mind.<br><br>
As for the Faroese, whom we are here discussing, they have no right to fish off Cornwall, where they have not fished in the past. The Norwegians, on the other hand, are permitted to catch their 35,000 tonnes of western mackerel, either off Cornwall or the west of Scotland, and our enforcement vessels keep a very close watch on the progress of this fishery.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, East asked about the pout box. The case before the European court has not yet been heard; that is the state of play at present on that item.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East spoke about restructuring. This is a wide subject outside the scope of today's debate, but I have noted his comments.<br><br>
As for his specific point on the Faroes, there is no question of United Kingdom boats which have fished for mackerel having to revert to fishing for white fish at Faroe. The Government's aim in the negotiations on the EEC-Faroes agreement, to which I have just referred, was to secure white fish for that part of the United Kingdom fleet which has traditionally fishing at Faroe. Those boats are based mainly at Aberdeen, and Grimsby has a strong interest at Faroe. To repeat what I said earlier—the white fish that we have obtained at Faroe, although not as much as we would have wished, represent a valuable increase in the fishing opportunities available to these fishermen; that is very important.<br><br>
The hon. Member also raised a question about the White Fish Authority's advising the industry that it cannot issue any further approvals for new vessels
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0585">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
which would incur grant expenditure before 1 April next year. I am aware of the advice given by the Authority to the industry and hon. Members will appreciate that there are general constraints upon public expenditure.<br><br>
The funds made available to the White Fish Authority cannot, of course, be made an exception, and details of the grant and loan moneys to be made available to the White Fish Authority in 1979–80 must await publication of the Government's estimates for 1979–80, but, in general, the provisions will reflect the actual spending in 1978–79 and the expected outturn for 1979–80.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister appreciate the serious situation that has arisen in boat yards all round the coast through the cessation of these grants? Could not money be made available from the contingency fund to the White Fish Authority to enable it to make small grants? The stop-start system is unsatisfactory. Men are laid off and leave the industry—some even have to leave the area—never to return. Instead of the present stop-start system of payment, would it not be better to allow a continuous, strictly phased system of grants so that some work would always be available, rather than none at all?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the concern of the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Watt) and I have sympathy with his views. The matter has engaged the attention of Ministers. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and I met boatbuilders from Buckie a week ago to discuss the matter. This is entireley a matter for the White Fish Authority. It knows the allocation for the present year and is awaiting the allocation for the coming year. It is for the WFA to phase out the grants and loans in whatever way it sees fit. I know that there has been too much work on the stocks. However, it is a matter entirely for the WFA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How are boatbuilders to get out of their present difficulties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend and I met boatbuilders from Buckie and representatives of those areas, we stressed the importance of submitting a case regarding their needs. That information having been received, is now being considered by Ministers. We appreciate the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
need for long-term planning to create confidence in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a purely factual point, the Minister said that we would not know how much money had been made available to the WFA until the estimates had been published. Could he say when that is likely to be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That matter will be left in limbo, due to the election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Until immediately after the election?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The information will be made available as soon as possible. That is all I can say. As I said, details of the grant and loan moneys to be made available to the WFA in 1979–80 must await publication of the Government's estimates for 1979–80. But, in general, the provisions will reflect the actual spending in 1978–79 and the expected outturn in 1979–80. It is a matter for the White Fish Authority. The Government are doing their best.<br><br>
The situation is not of the Government's making. The Authority has had its allocation and it knows where it stands. Hon. Members accept that situation. How the WFA distributes its funds is its own affair, but we are in touch concerning these points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue the matter—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister giving way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say any more on the matter. We all know the situation, and the Government have policies which will come into effect as soon as the election is over. Hon. Members must answer for any other changes. However, we are responsible until the election is over, and we anticipate that we shall continue after the election.<br><br>
With regard to any further assistance that the Government may give to the industry in the long term, the fish-catching and processing industries have made submissions seeking Government assistance with longer term restructuring programmes. We accept that some adjustment will be necessary to ensure that the United Kingdom takes full advantage of the fishing opportunities available. Officials are considering the submissions urgently and an announcement will be made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0586">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
in due course. I think that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East, made reference to the survey being undertaken by the White Fish Authority, which has been in touch with the industry.<br><br>
With regard to the overall position of the CFP, past and future, the Government have maintained close and frequent contact with all the sectors of the industry, and are fully aware of the difficulties created by the Council's failure to agree on the revised CFP. The Government have continued to seek a settlement throughout these protracted negotiations and have adopted a flexible, pragmatic approach to the way in which their essential objectives on quotas, access and conservation can be met.<br><br>
Unfortunately, as we know, other member States have not been prepared to discuss our requirements constructively and the Government have been assured by the industry that no settlement at all is preferable to a settlement that does not meet those requirements. I think that we are all agreed on that. But at the end of the day, I stress the point that we are approaching not 1984, but 1982, and it was agreed before we came to power that, at that stage, other member countries of the Community would have equal access to our waters. That is the kind of situation that we can foresee and that we want to try to avoid. My right hon. Friend has been prominent in his leadership, with British fishing industry support, in getting changes.<br><br>
I end on a note about the progress of the CFP negotiations. There have been no substantive discussions of the CFP since the Council of Fisheries Ministers on 23 and 24 November 1978, as other member States have refused to discuss the United Kingdom's essential requirements for a settlement.<br><br>
However, I can say that arrangements for member States' fishing in third country waters have been agreed, as I have just said, for the whole of 1979 and, in general, have provided the United Kingdom with an acceptable share of the reduced total quantity available to the member States. Pending the settlement of the CFP, the Government have maintained in force the existing national conservation measures, as announced to the House on 22 March.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
We intend to introduce further measures on increased minimum mesh sizes for white fish and nephrops, and related provisions on the minimum permitted landing sizes of nephrops if adequate measures cannot be adopted on a Community basis. As regards the future timetable, other member States have not indicated that they are prepared, at present, to move from their positions expressed in the Fisheries Council on 23 and 24 November, and no date has yet been fixed for the next Fisheries Council.<br><br>
I need not stress that my right hon. Friend, who has been pressing for a revised CAP, is equally adamant that we have a revised CFP, which will take into account the substantial contributions that our fishing industry makes to the Community resources. We want to ensure that the settlement, when it comes— we hope it comes soon—will reflect the considerable contribution made by our fishermen; on that depends their future. It is important that we have all been moving in the same direction, with no less determination to ensure a successful outcome.<br><br>
As this is probably the final get-together of fisheries Members before the recess, perhaps I might say that I am pleased that the hon. Member for Fife, East, is here. I understand that he will not stand for Parliament again, so I will say that we have always enjoyed his presence and his contributions at our meetings, and hope that he will be able to follow our future progress with some pleasure, whoever will be responsible for that.<br><br>
I also give to you, Miss Fookes, a word of thanks for your chairmanship this morning. We know that you also have a fishing interest, and hope that you will be able to fish in less troubled waters in future.</span></p>
