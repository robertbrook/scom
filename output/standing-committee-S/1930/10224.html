	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Protection against damage by game.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Without prejudice to Sub-section (3) of Section ten of the Act of 1911,—
	<ol>
	<li>the tenant of any holding to which the Landholders Acts apply shall, any law, or custom, or agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, have full right to kill and take on his holding any deer, game, vermin, or other wild animals or birds, so far as reasonably required for the protection of his land, and of any crops or other produce of, or on, his holding against injury or damage;</li>
	<li>Where a holding includes a right of common grazing over hill ground the landholders holding the grazing rights shall have full right to kill and take thereon ground game so far as reasonably required for the ,protection of their holdings;</li></ol></p>
	<p>Provided that the right hereby conferred shall be exerciseable only by two of their number appointed by them for that purpose.—[	<i>Mr. Scott.</i>]</p>
	<p>Brought up, and read the First time [	<i>19th February, 1931</i>].</p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed [	<i>19th February, 1931</i>], "That the Clause be read a Second time."—[	<i>Mr. Scott.</i>]</p>
	<p>Question again proposed.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for SCOTLAND (Mr. Johnston)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This question opens up tremendous possibilities for discussion. It is a question upon which there are very strong feelings, and Members on this side have given very strong pledges on the matter. I am going to make a suggestion which may expedite matters. The Clause is in .two parts. The first deals with deer,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1936</span>
game, vermin, and other wild animals and birds, and the second deals with common grazings. We find it difficult to accept the first part in its present form. For example, a landholder is only to be allowed to protect his land so far as reasonably required for its protection. The interpretation of what is reasonably required for the protection of his land would undoubtedly open up very considerable disputations in the law courts, and it is unfair that the small landholder should have put upon him the onus of either proving or defending his action in such a case. Secondly, it would apparently give power for the destruction of wild birds even in the season when they are protected. I could give other reasons, but for those two alone the Clause, in our judgment, is inadmissible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a more valid reason why it should not be accepted. One of the first steps the Government took on assuming office was to arrange for a complete examination of the deer forest problem, to see how far we could get agreement among the interests concerned to have admitted grievances remedied. At the instance of the Secretary of State, a conference was called at Edinburgh, which I attended on his behalf, representing deer forest proprietors, farm servants, breeders of black-faced sheep, the National Farmers' Union, and every interest we could think of. We had a long and very amicable discussion, and finally I suggested that this joint conference should itself select a small committee, representing all the interests concerned, which should draft the heads of an agreed policy, if any agreed policy could be arrived 'at, which we might put into legislation at once. We have the heads of an agreement from this committee, and the Law Officers are now examining them and the legal consequences which may follow from some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee would take our advice, they would negative the first part of the Clause and leave the Government and its legal advisers the right and duty of bringing in legislation to deal with this problem. If the Clause is accepted as it now stands, it means that the small landholders will have power to destroy, under certain circumstances, deer, wing game, and so on, which come to invade their crops, but the larger farmers have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P2I0969">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1937</span>
no such power, and you would have this extraordinary situation of so many smallholders dotted about the county with powers to destroy marauding deer, for example, which are not held by their neighbours in other parts of the county. I hope the Committee will agree that this form of Clause will not do and that the problem of marauding deer, for example, is a much larger question which must 'be dealt with nationally and not piecemeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the second part of the Clause, we think there is an urgent necessity to have the matter dealt with, and we hope to deal with it in the Bill. We think the crofters should have the right to destroy ground game upon their common grazing, which is part of the farm—the same power that is held by any other agricultural tenant—and I hope the Committee will leave my right hon. Friend and his advisers in this position, that on Report stage we will bring in a Clause dealing with the second point substantially in the same form as the present proposal, subject to some technical and legal amendments. I hope the Committee will also agree to negative the first part of the new Clause on the understanding that we are dealing with the subject in a much more comprehensive way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl of DALKEITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Under-Secretary of State if he intends to deal with the first part of this new Clause in this Bill or in another Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is utterly impossible to deal with the whole question of deer forests in this Bill. We have the heads of an agreement, as I have said, from all the interests concerned, and they are being discussed by the Law Officers of the Crown. Great complexities with regard to valuations have to be considered, but we are hoping to be in a position to bring in comprehensive legislation on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the whole, the proposal of the Under-Secretary of State is reasonable, and I am satisfied that the Government do intend to take some action to deal with the difficulties which are constantly arising through the depredations of game on holdings in Scotland. I quite see his point that it is impossible to introduce a Clause into this Bill dealing with large farms. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>1938</span>
seems to be unfair that smallholders should have rights which are not given to large farmers. In my view, we should have a Clause in this Bill dealing with smallholders and a Clause on the agricultural side dealing with farmers. The answer, of course, to that is that the question is bristling with difficulties and that the Government are seeking time in order to consider the problem to a greater extent; but there must be a limit, because the conference was held nearly two years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In December, 1929.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over 12 months ago, and during all that time this problem has been within the scope and vision of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were waiting for the agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty is that you may wait until the Greek Kalends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then there cannot be very much delay in bringing forward the proposals suggested by the Under-Secretary of State. I should like to know whether the Government propose to introduce a Bill, upon the lines of the agreement reached at the conference, during this Session. I do not propose to press that question, but I should like to know whether that is their intention. There is no reason why they should not bring in the Bill this Session. This question was discussed during the War, and at that time there was general agreement that something in the nature of this new Clause should be placed upon the Statute Book. As far as this party is concerned, we are prepared to accept the suggestion of the Under-Secretary of State provided we can get a definite pledge from the Government that they will introduce a Bill this Session upon the lines agreed upon at the conference in Edinburgh. I hope they will give us that promise. It is not a binding promise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The SECRETARY of STATE for SCOTLAND (Mr. William Adamson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought the Under-Secretary of State had made the position very clear and that the right hon. and learned Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Macpherson) was going to accept the assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1939</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted the assurance to be made as definite as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ADAMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the right hon. and learned Gentleman was going to accept the assurance that has been given. Now he asks me to go a little further and to assure him of our good intentions so far as legislation of this character is concerned. The fact that very shortly after we came into office we took this step proves beyond doubt that we are anxious to deal with this difficulty. I can assure him that, with a view of being able to produce legislation which will deal satisfactorily with the problem, not only from the point of view of the smallholder but from the point of view of other sections of agriculture, the Law Officers of the Crown are closely examining the nature of the legislation which will be required; and, as far as I am personally concerned, no time will be lost in producing the necessary Measure. I am as anxious as any Member of the Committee to get this problem straightened out. No one recognises more than I do that it requires to be dealt with. Having given the right hon. and learned Gentleman this assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Kincardine (Mr. Scott) will withdraw this new Clause and allow us to deal with the problem in the most satisfactory way possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. STUART</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Secretary of State misunderstood the remarks of the right hon. and learned Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Macpherson). He asked for a promise, but he said he did not want a binding promise. I do not know what the difference is; I should like to know when a promise is not binding. If it is not binding, it really does not matter, and I suggest to the Secretary of State that he should give the promise at once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir FREDERICK THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the landholder with grazing rights over common land should have the right to kill ground game, but it should be on the same footing as other occupiers of agricultural land under the Ground Game Acts. This Sub-section in the new Clause will hardly be appropriate in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept the definite pledge given by the Under-Secretary of State in the sense which I

On that understanding, and also on the understanding that the question dealt with in Sub-section (2) will be considered on the Report stage, I am prepared to withdraw the proposed new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Amendment of s. 7 of principal Act.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Section seven of the principal Act shall be amended by adding the following words:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that nothing in this Act shall free or relieve any landlord from liability for any compensation payable to his outgoing tenant, and any agreement to transfer such liability in whole or part to the incoming tenant shall be null and void unless a definite maximum limit is agreed to in writing."—[	<i>Mr. Scott.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of the Amendments suggested by the National Farmers' Union. It is an Amendment of Section 7 of the Agricultural Holdings Acts, 1923, and it refers to the transference of claims for compensation. May I remind the Committee that Section 7 of the principal Act deals with the right of a tenant who has paid compensation to the outgoing tenant, and provides that where the incoming tenant has paid compensation, then the incoming tenant shall be entitled on quitting the holding to claim compensation in like manner. What happens is that an incoming tenant offers a rent on the general appearance and condition of the farm, without any means of knowing particulars of the outgoing tenant's claim. He may offer a high rent based on the good condition of the farm, and when he enters may find himself faced with a claim to pay over again the value of what he has already included in his rent. He may find himself saddled with a heavy compensation c-Mm which he did not anticipate, and I suggest that this provision is necessary to prevent an incoming tenant being saddled with an unknown liability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had representations from the National Farmers' Union on this subject. On the face of

	<span class='label label-info column'>1941</span>
it, it seems reasonable, and we promised to examine it and see if we could meet the difficulty. But there is one point which we have never been able to settle, and I observe that the hon. Member has not explained it. In his new Clause he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unless a definite maximum limit is agreed to in writing."</p></blockquote>
Obviously, any proprietor who desired to impose upon a new tenant would simply insist upon a very high maximum limit in writing. The object which the hon. Gentleman the Member for Kincardine (Mr. Scott) has in view could quite easily be got round by the simple expedient of making a very high maximum limit in the initial agreement between the landlord and the incoming tenant. To the general proposition that the incoming tenant should know his liabilities, we are quite agreed, and in equity that should be arranged. But so far we have been unable to get a Clause, or a suggested Amendment of the Clause, drafted in such a way as would make the matter clear beyond dispute and would achieve the result which the hon. Member for Kincardine and every other Member in the Committee would desire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell him frankly, that on most other Acts of Parliament we would have accepted right away a new Clause such as the proposed Clause, but the extraordinary complexities of land legislation in Scotland are more and more borne in upon us, and we hesitate to accept anything which does not appear to us to be absolutely watertight, lest by so doing we should simply be opening the door to fresh evasions and fresh legal difficulties in the Court of Session and elsewhere. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied that we are in agreement with him in principle. We accept the principle he is trying to get at, and if we can get a. form of words which will achieve the end in view, the Secretary of State for Scotland will, between now and the Report stage, very gladly consider the matter, but the form of words which the hon. Member has drafted in sticking in a definite maximum limit in writing, is so clearly capable of evasion that we are advised that the Clause would be useless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal with the points which have been raised by the hon. Gentleman? I do not think that there is so much weight in his argument as per-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1942</span>
haps he is inclined to think, and for the following reason: If a landlord were to take up that attitude and set a very high figure, he would discourage any tenant from coming forward. It is quite as much in the landlord's interest as it is in the tenant's interest to see that he puts the figure at a reasonable sum. I only want to justify that position in the wording of my Clause. My hon. Friend will see that if the landlord really wants a new tenant and sets the maximum compensation at a fairly reasonable figure, it will be fair to the landlord and also to the incoming tenant, because he will know approximately the amount he may have to pay and will offer rent accordingly. I am prepared to leave it on the basis suggested by my hon. Friend, provided that he will put down on the Report stage a Clause similar in principle to the proposed Clause, with approved wording, if he can find the words. I suggest to him that he might reconsider the value of the words which are in my proposed Clause. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask the Under-Secretary of State a question, if this matter is to be considered with a view to something being done on the Report stage. Would not the Government take into consideration afresh the question of whether the proper solution is not that the outgoing tenant should give some notice of his claim at some period before he goes out? I put the question in a general way, as it would be out of order to go into detail. Is not that a very much simpler solution? I recognise the difficulties which the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, but I am sure that the other solution is simpler.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<div class='clause'>NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Amendment of s. 8 of principal Act.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Section eight of the principal Act shall be amended by adding after the word "tenancies" the words "either under leases or year-to-year tenancies or tacit relocation," and there shall be added at the end of the said section "For the purposes of this section any tenant who is in the tenancy by reason of succession or bequest shall have the same rights to claim compensation as the previous tenant would have had if he had remained in the tenancy."—[	<i>Mr. Scott.</i>]</p>
	<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause is an Amendment of Section 8 of the principal Act, which deals with the provision as to change of tenancy and provides that a tenant who remains in his holding when there are two or more tenancies shall not, on quitting the tenancy, be deprived of his right to obtain compensation under this Act by reason only of the fact that the improvements were not made during the tenancy on the termination of which he quits the holding. The Amendment proposes that in the second line of the Section there should be included certain words, and the opening words of the Section would then read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A tenant who has remained in his holding during two or more tenancies either under leases or year-to-year tenancies or tacit relocation shall not, on quitting his holding be deprived of the right of compensation,"</p></blockquote>
and to add, at the end, the following words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section any tenant who is in the tenancy by reason of succession or bequest shall have the same rights to claim compensation as the previous tenant would have had if he had remained in the tenancy."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the Amendment is to safeguard the tenant's claim for compensation to improvements against being invalid because of his entering a new lease. The simplest case, of course, is where a son succeeds his father in a farm and the son takes on a new lease in his own name. The risk at present is, that the son will thereby lose all the rights of compensation, claims to which he would have succeeded if he had simply carried on his father's lease. It is clearly inequitable that he should lose his rights of compensation, and the Clause is intended to prevent that leakage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1944</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Kincardine (Mr. Scott) is not going to persist in putting forward this Clause, as the Amendment which he proposes to add is quite unnecessary for two reasons. It is unnecessary, because it would add two unnecessary things to Section 8 of the Act of 1923. By that Section the tenant who remains in the holding during several tenancies has secured to him the right of compensation for improvements made during any of the tenancies, and the tenancy would include a lease for a term of years, or from year-to-year. The first part of the Amendment proposes to make the Section read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"During two or more tenancies either under leases or year-to-year."</p></blockquote>
That is quite unnecessary, and further it reads somewhat oddly, for tenancies under year-to-year arrangements are by no means clear. The second part of the proposed Amendment is therefore not required, and its insertion might well be undesirable and lead to repercussions which it is very difficult for the Committee to comprehend. I hope that we are not going to have too much time spent over a Clause which we consider to be very undesirable indeed, and which would lead to complications, and therefore I hope that the hon. Member will see his way to withdraw the Clause, having had an opportunity of stating his case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the right hon. Gentleman has scarcely appreciated the importance of this Clause. I do not think that he understands that at the present time the landlord has the right—and I understand, on occasion exercises it—to the particular improvements not only to which he is entitled but to which the tenant is really entitled. He takes it when a father dies leaving the lease to be taken up by the son. If the son takes a, new lease in his own name, he runs the risk, and I believe incurs the risk repeatedly, of losing his right to compensation to which the father would have been entitled. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the words "two or more tenancies." In the Section these refer to the tenant himself, and it might quite well be that this Section protects the tenant who has taken one 19 years' lease followed by another 19 years' lease, but it does not protect cases which are dealt with in the proposed Clause where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P2I0973">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1945</span>
a son succeeds his father. It is necessary to be explicit with regard not only to ordinary leases of, say, a period of years but also with regard to year-to-year tenancies, keeping in view that even a majority of large holdings at the present time in Scotland are held on year-to-year tenancies and on tacit relocation after a long lease has expired. I think that the first words of my Clause are very necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the last words proposed to be added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any tenant who is in the tenancy by reason of succession or bequest shall have the same rights to obtain compensation,"</p></blockquote>
I cannot imagine that my right hon. Friend wishes to leave open the door for a landlord to claim compensation to which he is not entitled. If I can convince him, as I am trying to do, that this Clause prevents a leakage of that sort, I trust that he will reconsider his attitude to the Clause and between now and the Report stage endeavour to give effect to the purposes of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Member for Kincardine (Mr. Scott) that we have considered the aspect upon which he has enlarged in his second speech, and we are advised that the case which he has put is on a wrong assumption. For example, if we take the case which he has stated—the case of a son who follows his father under a new lease. That is a new tenancy, and compensation for all improvements could be demanded at the change of tenancy. Therefore, we do not consider that the new Clause which has been put forward is necessary. I am quite as anxious as he is to close any door that would lead to injustice, but this Clause has been closely examined, and, as advised, we cannot see our way to accept it. I hope that the hon. Member will see his way to withdraw the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Lord Advocate whether a tenant who is in the tenancy by reason of succession or bequest referred to in the proposed new Clause is covered by the definition of "tenant" in Section 49 of the Act of 1923? He seems to be, and, if so, that would make the matter quite clear and satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major McKENZIE WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that the argument or the explana-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1946</span>
tion of the Secretary of State for Scotland does not seem to be at all satisfactory. He says that the case is already met by Section 8 of the Act of 1923. Section 8 of the Act of 1923 simply says that if a man has two tenancies, one after the other, any improvements carried out during the first tenancy will rank for compensation even at the end of the second tenancy. No doubt that is very desirable and is of great assistance to the tenant, but that is not the case with which the new Clause is designed to deal at all.

It is the case where the two tenancies are held by different persons, for instance, the father and the son. In cases where two tenancies are held, first, by the father and, secondly, by the son, they do not come under Section 8 of the Act of 1923. Everyone knows perfectly well that, in the case of smallholdings especially, it is the usual thing for the tenancies to be handed down from father to son for many generations. This new Clause is to protect improvements that have been carried out, nominally by the father but really by the son, from being appropriated by the landlord. That is the specific case which the new Clause is meant to deal with, and I cannot understand why there should be any difficulty in the matter. The reply made by the right hon. Gentleman does not meet the case, and I hope that we shall have some fuller explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACPHERSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Government adopt this attitude in regard to the Clause. It is obvious that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State came prepared to turn down the new Clause with reasons which were not altered by the speech of the hon. Member for Kincardine (Mr. Scott). If he had listened carefully to the speech of my hon. Friend and the speech of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Banff (Major Wood), he would have found that the arguments with which he came prepared were knocked to smithereens. The fact is, that Section 8 of the Act of 1923 does not cover this particular point. The hon. and gallant Member for Banff made it perfectly clear that the new Clause deals with two different tenancies, and that there is case after case in the Highlands of father succeeding son, with two quite distinct tenancies, where the compensation is not

payable. The hon. and learned Member for South Aberdeen (Sir F. Thomson) suggests that Section 49 of the Act of 1923 covers the point, but it does not. That Section states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tenant' means the holder of land under a lease."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Lord Advocate will bear me out in the legal interpretation that we seek to give to the new Clause. The matter is of such importance that we ought to be given a pledge from the Government that if they cannot deal with it now, they will raise it on the Report stage. With respect, I submit that our speeches have shown that the arguments adduced by the Secretary of State are arguments which were prepared last night, without any reference to the arguments which we have produced to-day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Lord Advocate asks whether there has been any difficulty in practice. He is, by inference, accepting our principle. If he wants cases, I cannot give them at the present moment.

It has nothing in the world to do with it. Let us clear from our minds any idea that this is a question which concerns either crofters or smallholders. Having disposed of that extraneous matter, I do not see much substance in the point which has been put forward. The situation seems to be this, that if a son succeeds to an ordinary agricultural holding—not a croft or a smallholding—he gets a new lease. Why should he not at that time—I ask for information, because I am not certain what the answer will be—when entering as a new tenant, claim compensation What is to prevent him from claiming compensation like any other new tenant? Is it contended that if the son, "B," succeeds the father, "A," in the holding, by taking a new lease, and he asks for compensation, he is not to get it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It cannot be said that there is a definite exclusion of rights in such a case. The people who get the compensation at the end of the father's lease are the father's representatives, and a new tenant comes in and he makes a claim for compensation. That is the ordinary course of agricultural operation. Why should not that operate in the case of father and son? The matter requires far closer analysis. I suspect that by postponing the right of compensation to the end of the second tenancy, you are entirely inverting the whole law in regard to compensation. It would seem to be clear that the proper time to fix compensation is at the end of one tenancy and the beginning of another. This matter has a far wider implication than has been suggested, and I Would urge the Government to consider what is the legal effect of postponing compensation until the end of the tenancy of tenant "B," when you are dealing with the situation that arose, and should have been settled, at the exit of tenant "A," that is, the father. It would be perfectly simple then. I believe that at the back of this there is a good deal of unconscious hanky-panky.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Lord Advocate asks whether there is any evidence of cases of hardship.

It is only there because they have evidence of hardships of this kind. The second answer that I would give is, that if the law definitely says that certain claims will not be admitted, or it does not allow them to be admitted, you will not get tenants going into Court or in any other way making public their claims. Consequently, there are no claims that you can give in evidence. I think the argument put forward by the Lord Advocate that there is no evidence of hard3hip falls to the ground. I still hope that the Government will deal with the matter ether now or on the Report stage. I cannot, see any argument against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Section ten of the principal Act shall be amended by adding at the end thereof "and provided that compensation shall not be payable under this section unless a record of the condition of the holding has been made under the principal Act, or any Act by that Act repealed, or in respect of any matter arising before the date of the record so made."—[	<i>Mr. Scott.</i>]</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 9 of the principal Act provides compensation for the tenant, and there is a proviso that a record of the condition of the holding must be made before the tenant can claim compensation. When you come to Section 10, which gives the landlord power to claim compensation from the tenant for deterioration upon the holding, there is no such restriction upon him, although a record must have been kept. That is obviously unfair, and my Clause remedies a clear injustice. One can quite see how a tenant can be prejudiced by the fact that no record has been kept. If he has it in view to make a claim, it is in his interest to see that a record is kept, as, otherwise, the claim may fail, but he is at a disadvantage compared with the landlord if the landlord can come forward at the end of the day and make a claim alleging that he has deteriorated the holding and the tenant has no record to which he can appeal to show that he has not deteriorated it. I suggest that the Committee should accept the Clause in order to put both tenant and landlord on the same footing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, everyone agrees that this is a desirable and a necessary thing to do, hut a reference to the proviso in the 1923 Act, of which this would become a part, shows that it would become meaningless. We hope, with the aid of the Government draftsman, to get a, Clause drafted for consideration on Report which will meet
	<span class='label label-info column'>1952</span>
the point, but these words obviously would not meet the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that there is no reason why this new Clause should be accepted, because the landlord has to prove to the satisfaction of the arbiter that the value of the holding has been deteriorated during the tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are you not in favour of keeping a record?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A record is always an advantage, as it will be easier to prove, but I do not see why, simply because a record has not been kept, the claim should be turned down. High farming is rather a different thing. High farming means the continuous adoption of a system of farming which has been more beneficial to the holding than the standard required by the lease. By the lease the tenant has to farm according to the rules of good husbandry, but this is something more. Sir Isaac Connell, in his book on agricultural holdings, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the tenant were continuously to have land much longer in grass than his contract requires, if he were continuously to follow a five-course shift while he was at liberty to follow a four-course shift, if he were to greatly improve his pastures, e.g., by sowing down and specially nurturing wild white clover, if by the exceptional bringing in of very large quantities of dung he were to improve the mechanical quality of the soil as well as its fertility."</p></blockquote>
These are all things which may entitle a man to compensation for high farming. They are all difficult to prove. You have to start from the standard where the man is bound to farm his land according to the rules of good husbandry. The cases are not on all fours. It is an advantage to have a record, but that the landlord should be discharged from the onus of proving deterioration does not seem reasonable, as I do not think there is a complete analogy between this case and claiming compensation for high farming. I do not see that it is necessary to hold that compensation shall not be payable unless there is a record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P2I0977">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1953</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member recommended the Clause on the ground that this was just treating like things in a like way and that, if you have a record for compensation for high farming, so it was proper that you should have a record for deterioration. But, although I agree with the Government as to the advantage of a record, the two things are not the same. If you were going to have them on all fours, you would have at present no record necessary for ordinary improvements and no record necessary for ordinary deterioration, but records necessary for special improvements and for exceptional deterioration. It is not true that at present what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander, and, if a new Clause is being framed, that should be kept in view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause suggests to me that it is retrospective in character and that a claim for compensation emerging, say, next November would fail because there has been no record kept, the lease having begun several years ago. That seems to be most unfair. That is why I say you have to compare like with like, and, if you are going to admit a record only for high farming, 	<i>per contra</i> it should only be added for exceptional deterioration. If you are going to introduce the system of a record, which has very much to commend it, let it be introduced universally and so that its operation will be for leases entered into after the date of the passage of the Clause. That seems to me to be essential. I demur from the no doubt innocent logical misrepresentation of the hon. Member in commending the Clause on the ground that it is only treating the gander as you treat the goose. It is not so. Words to effect that purpose would have to be "any exceptional deterioration."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Duchess of ATHOLL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add a few words to what my hon. Friend has said. It seems to me that it will be very difficult to make a record in case of deterioration. Exceptionally good farming depends on certain acts done by the tenant. It is easy for him to keep a record that he sowed white clover or put in an extra quantity of manure. Those are definite acts done on
	<span class='label label-info column'>1954</span>
a definite date. But deterioration, surely, comes from failure to do things, or not doing things in the best way or at the right moment, or not choosing the right kind of seed for the particular soil. I do not see how you can keep a record of negative things. You could not expect the tenant to keep a record that he sowed his seed too late or that he did not choose the best kind of seed. It seems to me that to ask for a record to be kept of acts which have caused deterioration is an impossibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>NEW CLAUSE.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Amendment of s. 12 of principal Act.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>The first paragraph of Sub-section (6) of Section twelve of the principal Act shall be repealed, and the following paragraph shall be substituted:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The compensation payable under this section shall be a sum equal to not less than two years' rent, and not exceeding four years' rent of the holding."—[	<i>Mr. Scott.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Brought up, and read the First time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 12 of the principal Act relates to compensation for this purpose, and Sub-section (6) specifies the basis on which compensation is to be given to a tenant on being disturbed in his tenancy. It provides for compensation representing such loss as has been directly attributable to the quitting of the holding. In order to obviate dealing with various items of expenses of that kind, it provides for payment of a round sum representing one year's rent or, in other circumstances, a maximum of two years' rent of the holding. The reason for my proposal, to which I understand farmers attach the greatest importance, is that one year's rent has been proved by experience to be absolutely inadequate compensation to a tenant who is turned out of his holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Imagine the case of 'a man who has been in occupation for several long leases, and some wealthy man comes along, takes a fancy to the holding and offers a big rent. The landlord, either the new one or the old, proceeds to give notice to the tenant to quit. Is it suggested that the life's work of this man is represented by the payment of one year's rent? Has he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1930-1931V000P2I0978">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1955</span>
acquired during all that time no greater goodwill in the farm than can be measured by the payment of a year's rent? The farmers of Scotland have no hesitation in saying that the payment is quite inadequate and that it should not be less than two years' rent, with a maximum of four years' rent. The intention of the principal Act was to give some substitute to tenant farmers for the lack of security of tenure which they did not and still do not possess. This new Clause is intended to provide adequate compensation. The compensation under the principal Act is inadequate. I shall be much interested in the attitude of the Government towards this proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member tell us of one case in which the arbiter has awarded up to the maximum of two years' compensation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for what the arbiter has done, but I do know that this new Clause has been put down because of representations by the National Farmers' Union. I have no particulars of cases myself, but I assume that members of the National Farmers' Union have themselves been affected by the inadequate compensation given under the principal Act. Naturally the arbiter usually fixes compensation on the basis of one year's rent. The National Farmers' Union have put forward this new Clause because they have had representations made to them of hardship which has occurred because of inadequate corn pensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member says that he does not know of any case in which the arbiter has awarded a maximum of two years' compensation, but that the National Farmers' Union are in favour of this proposal and would not have urged an extension of compensation to four years' rent unless there were valid grounds for so doing. The Committee is entitled to some better reasons why this new Clause should be inserted, and we should run the risk of losing the Bill. We are advised by our officials that they know of only one case where the arbiter has awarded up to two years' compensation, and, if that is true, there is no use in seeking to put a highly contentious new Clause into this Bill and run the risk of losing the Measure upon a point which has no substance at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1956</span>
I happen to know that the National Farmers Union of Scotland are so satisfied with the Bill as it stands—it meets the claims which they have been making for years—that they are intensely desirous of its reaching the Statute Book as soon as possible and that nothing should be done, by introducing theoretical points and new disputations, which would run the risk of losing the Bill. Unless we can get evidence that there is serious grievance, I hope the hon. Member will not overload the Bill either now or on Report stage and risk losing all the valuable Clauses which are actively and enthusiastically supported by the agricultural community in Scotland and by the Farmers Union, whose representatives have pleaded with us to do nothing which would run the risk of losing the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I put down this new Clause I understood that the Under-Secretary of State had had meetings with the National Farmers Union and that they had supplied him with cases.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only wanted to make the position of the Government clear. I do not say that there may not be hard cases which might necessitate a widening of the Section, but as far as we know there has only been one case, and we do not think it worth jeopardising the fate of the Bill for one case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rather ludicrous that this new Clause should be put down without any evidence to back it. Only one case has been given where an arbiter has awarded up to two years' compensation, and if the new Clause was passed, it would really amount to confiscation of a considerable part of the value of a holding, and it would be almost impossible in those circumstances to remove a bad farmer from his holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This new Clause relates to a tenant's right to claim compensation for improvements. Cases arise where a tenant, in order to avoid expense, makes no claim for improvements; if he made a claim, he would have to give notice before the termination of the tenancy. He leaves his holding, and he then finds that the landlord comes against him with a claim. Had the tenant known this, he would have been alert enough to have put in a claim on his own account. The result is that while the landlord may
	<span class='label label-info column'>1958</span>
claim against the tenant, the tenant finds himself barred from making a counterclaim. The purpose of the new Clause is quite clear from the wording. The principle contained in the latter part of the new Clause is well recognised in the Smallholdings Act. If a smallholder acts in contravention of one of the statutory provisions, it does not deprive him of his right to compensation, yet, in the same way, if a large farmer commits a breach of one of the conditions of his lease, it may involve him in penalties or a claim for deterioration. On the other hand, it should not preclude the tenant from himself making a claim for compensation for improvement. The equity of the new Clause must be apparent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope this new Clause will not be pressed and that we may dispose of it in a few minutes. It is in two parts. The first part allows a tenant to make a late counter-claim. That is open to two objections. In the case mentioned by the hon. Member for Kincardine (Mr. Scott), the tenant could have made a claim if he had chosen to do so, and if he does not, I do not think he should be allowed to come along and make it at a later stage when he finds that the landlord has exercised his right and made a claim. Apart from that, the new Clause runs counter to the whole law of compensation. It is well established that you cannot set a non-liquid claim against a liquid claim, and to introduce a provision of this kind into this Bill is to introduce an anomaly into the law of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the second part of the proposed new Clause, I could not countenance a provision in those terms. It is proposed that
	<br><blockquote><p>"no contravention by the tenant of any condition of his lease, or contract of tenancy, shall deprive a tenant of or diminish his right to compensation in respect of improvements which he has executed."</p></blockquote>
With all respect, I think that that is much too wide in its terms. I do not see why this Committee should put a premium on a breach of any contract or upon a contract of lease. Accordingly, I submit that the Clause, however honourable the intention may be, would merely have the effect of adding a certain amount of lumber to the Bill, and it would not have the slightest chance of going through in another place.

I demur at once from the suggestion made that the new Clauses which I have put upon the Paper are not valid and real. This is an instance of an absurdity which has arisen where the landlord gave a notice to quit to the tenant. I assure the Lord Advocate that there are many instances of the kind, so I am informed, where a landlord has given notice to quit to a tenant. The tenant has acted upon the notice and left the holding, and then proceeded to claim compensation for unreasonable disturbance. Then the landlord has come down and said, "Oh, there was a mistake in the notice to quit which I gave you. You did not require to leave after all." Then the tenant has found that his claim for disturbance was invalid, and in the meantime he had left the holding and taken another holding and was obviously greatly prejudiced. It should not be possible for such a thing to occur, and I suggest that the Clause is necessary to meet a known grievance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is quite common in all kinds of leases that a clause is inserted to provide for an eventuality of this sort. It is obvious that if subjects which are left to tenants are destroyed by fire and the landlord gets the insurance money, if the tenant has been paying the premium for insurance, the landlord ought to be bound to replace the buildings.

This Clause is practically identical with a Clause which stood in the Agriculture Bill of 1920 when it left the House of Commons and went to another place, where it was rejected. The Committee may, therefore, assume that there is 	<i>prima, facie</i> evidence of something material in the Clause. It refers to a tenant who has a perfectly just claim against his landlord, but, at the end of the day, the landlord goes bankrupt, and the tenant finds that he cannot recover one penny of his claim from the landlord. That is obviously unjust. The new Clause proposes that some steps should be taken to protect the tenant who is landed in that situation. In the case of the landlord refusing to pay, or being unable to pay, the tenant ought to have some remedy. The remedy that the Clause proposes is that it should be competent for the Minister, that is, the Department of Agriculture, to make as a first charge on the holding the amount of the sum that is due to the tenant, and the costs that he has properly incurred. It may be that the Department will have to regulate other claims besides the claim of the tenant against the landlord, and the Clause carefully provides for that. In the first place, however, it is provided that the Department must give the tenant the first charge upon the holding in respect of the amount of the claim due to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the hon. Member has in view, I am bound to say that there are very great difficulties in the way of accepting this Clause. The purpose of the Clause is to create a priority in favour of the tenant. I have a good deal of difficulty in regard to that. Why should the tenant be given priority, if there is a prior creditor? There may be prior creditors. I do not know under the Clause how the charge is to be adjusted, and, if there are competing creditors, how the adjustment is to be effected, and I do not know how the charge is to be enforced. I sympathise with the view that the tenant who has a claim for compensation, the amount of which has been ascertained, and is unable to effect the claim, should be protected, and while I also sympathise with the view that it is desirable to give him some kind of remedy that would be simple and effectual, I do think that a charge of the kind proposed in the Clause should not be assented to without very carefully devising appropriate machinery to meet the situation. Accordingly, as the Clause does not contain any machinery that would deal with the matter, I hope that my hon. Friend will see his way, having brought the matter to the notice of the Committee, not to insist on the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major WOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite understand that there is difficulty of the nature referred to by the Lord Advocate, but he has admitted that there is something in the Clause and that there is a, grievance to be dealt with. It is a very great grievance, and in same cases it acts very hardly upon the tenants who have spent a great deal in improving their land. It is up to the Government, with their advisers, to find a way out of these difficulties. If they agree that there is something behind the new Clause, and they are unable to accept the Clause in the words in which it is put forward, we have a right to expect them to put forward something in its place. The heritable creditor will get the benefit of any improvements made by the tenant, and he has no greater right to it than the tenant. I hope that we shall have an assurance from the Government that in the near future they will look into this matter and take steps to meet what is a real grievance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is my view. If I am wrong, there may be something to be said for the Clause, if it can be made legally watertight. Surely, the cases where the tenant suffers in the way suggested must be very few, because compensation is usually paid. We had an eloquent speech on a previous new Clause as to the new tenant who comes in and has to pay compensation to the outgoing tenant, and as to his having been misled regarding the value of the farm.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The bankruptcy of the landlord does not prevent the new tenant from having to pay compensation to the outgoing tenant. Surely, that must be so in practice. If that be so, what a fantastic farrago of propaganda this Clause becomes! Everybody knows that it would undermine the whole capital arrangement of land tenure in Scotland if bonds, which are necessary very often for the improvement of the permanent buildings, should become a secondary security, the primary security being the compensation which the outgoing tenant should get from the ingoing tenant. This is one of those bucolic attempts to alter the law which should never have been encouraged by the hon. Member for Kincardine (Mr. Scott), who is himself a. lawyer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that where no question of law arises there should be no appointment of a lawyer as clerk to the arbiter. In most of these agricultural references the matters are purely practical ones, and the arbiter is perfectly competent to dispose of them himself, unaided, but the regular practice is that an arbiter almost immediately on his appointment appoints a clerk of reference, who is usually a lawyer. That

	<span class='label label-info column'>1969</span>
is a matter which has caused a great deal of heart-burning among the farmers of Scotland, because of the expense which has been laid upon them unnecessarily by the appointment of clerks or law agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told of one case in which an arbiter employed a man as clerk to the reference when no points of law were involved and the arbiter's fees were fixed by the Department on an exorbitant scale. I have another instance where an arbitration did not involve more than two days' travelling, and the fee of the arbiter, who was a farmer and valuer, was 14 guineas. That is more than a lawyer receives per day. In addition, the clerk appointed by the arbiter charged 10 guineas. The total cost of the arbitration, including travelling expenses, was £30 4s. It is not for me to suggest the correct charges but, obviously, these arbiters' expenses can be considerably reduced if it is not understood that it is a matter of general practice for the arbiter to appoint a clerk to the reference. Surely the parties who bear the expense of the reference ought to be con-suited, and, assuming that one of the parties withholds his consent, in the opinion of the other party unwarrantedly, it should be open to the other party to appeal to the Department of Agriculture, and, if the Department in its omniscience thinks a clerk should be appointed, it may be possible to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to mention one other case. I have been asked so often for particulars of cases that I should like to justify this one where I am in a position to do it. The arbiter was a civil engineer and a practical farmer, recognised as one of the foremost land valuators in the North of Scotland. He inspected the farm, fixed the amount, employed no clerk and fixed his own fee at six guineas. Naturally the parties to that reference did not grudge the fee. In an almost exactly similar case the Department fixed a farmer-arbiter's fee at nine guineas, and, in addition, the parties had to pay over £8 for his lawyer clerk's fee. It is clear that the expenses of these arbiters have been bounding far too high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir PATRICK FORD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am filled with some alarm by the hon. Member's speech. To begin with, this blacklegging of the legal profession by one member of it, although camouflaged by some statement that the table of fees was on a more
	<span class='label label-info column'>1970</span>
moderate scale, really seems to me to portend evil and to indicate the breaking up of the whole trade union movement. I am not sure whether the hon. Member represents the great Liberal party in the Trade Disputes Bill Committee, but, if so, I should think it would fill hon. Members opposite with some alarm if he carries out these sinister suggestions. Apart from that, it seems to me that to attribute omniscience to any Department is also a somewhat startling innovation. It is just that sort of secondary legislation brought in by hook or by crook, one way or another, giving too much power to Departments, that we on these benches, together with the Lord Chief Justice, have been protesting against for years. On these two grounds, I hope the hon. Member will see his way to follow what has become almost a habit with him, and withdraw the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The LORD ADVOCATE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also hope the Clause will be withdrawn. There may have been isolated cases of abuse, but the Clause will interfere with the freedom of the arbiter in a matter in which be ought really to be given a free hand. I think the remedy proposed is worse than the disease, because you will spend far more than the amount of the clerk's fee in arguing the thing out before the Department. There is really no substantial grievance to remedy. It is very much better that the matter should be left to the common sense of the arbiter, who will not employ a clerk or a law agent, unless it is necessary for the work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir F. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One feels a good deal of sympathy with the Clause. At first, of course, one remembers that under the Bill we have largely extended the scope of arbitration. Every conceivable case that now arises between landlord and tenant during the whole course of the lease goes to arbitration. It may seem rather absurd that the arbiter, who is given such wide functions, should not be allowed to appoint a clerk or a law agent to assist him except with the written consent of the parties, but the expenses of arbitration have been worrying the agricultural community a. great deal. We sometimes find that the clerk's fees and travelling expenses amount to as much as the fee of the arbiter, and the amounts chargeable against those who are arbitrating are very high. The Clause adds:

	<span class='label label-info column'>1971</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that where the consent to any such appointment is withheld … the Department shall decide whether such appointment is necessary."</p></blockquote>
There is a good deal to be said for it, and I am prepared to support the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. C. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very excellent Clause, and I am sure the hon. Member must have had it drawn up by the hon. Member for Leith (Mr. E. Brown), or he would have not got it so clear. When hon. and learned Gentlemen on my left and opposite attack the hon. Member for being a blackleg, I cart assure him that in this case I shall stand by him and do everything I can to prevent this appalling form of intimidation that is being exercised. I hope everyone will support the hon. Member, so that he may have one new Clause added to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WESTWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that there s an appeal from both sides of the Opposition to do the lawyers out of these fees, which evidently are an encumbrance to everyone associated with the land, I hope the Committee will accede to the request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that all sides are evidently agreed that there is something in the. Clause, I am prepared to accept the principle of it, but I am again advised that, as drafted, it will not suit. On the understanding that we will have it re-drafted between now and Report, I hope the hon. Member will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SCOTT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the right hon. Gentleman's assurance, and I ask leave to withdraw the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKINLAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to know why the Department of Agriculture should be the arbiter instead of the Land Court. Perhaps the hon. Member will explain. You cannot, I think, get a square deal from a bureaucratic Department! I have listened to the whole of this Debate and I fail to see why the Department should be introduced instead of the Land Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Motion and Clause, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. ADAMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee adjourns, I want to suggest that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1972</span>
we should hold our next meeting tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock. My reason for suggesting this is that nearly all the Standing Committees are now in session. This morning two important agricultural Bills have been considered in Committee and a number of hon. Members are on both Committees. If we adjourn until this afternoon we clash with the important Committee which is considering the Trade Disputes Bill, upon which a considerable number of hon. Members of this Committee are also sitting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ERNEST BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And there is a Select Committee on Procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ADAMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the circumstances, I think we should look for a time which is clear, and to-morrow afternoon will be the best time for this Committee to meet, as no other Standing Committee is set down for that day. I therefore suggest that we should meet to-morrow afternoon at four o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BARR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not raising any objection, but I think the Secretary of State has forgotten that there is a rather important meeting of his own party at four o'clock to-morrow, and if the faithful and loyal Members who are on this Committee are absent, it may have serious consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could meet later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir P. FORD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another sitting of the Committee will conclude the Bill. Why could we not sit next Tuesday morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Personally, I prefer the suggestion of the Secretary of State. We recognise the courtesy and pleasant way in which this Bill is being conducted, and we want to help both the Secretary of State and the Under, Secretary of State. If there is an important party meeting to-morrow afternoon, why not meet at half-past five?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ADAMSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think five o'clock would be the most convenient hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
