RATES (REGIONAL RATE) ORDER (NORTHERN IRELAND) 1984</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Butler)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Rates (Regional Rate) Order (Northern Ireland) 1984.</p></blockquote>
The order was made by the Department of Finance and Personnel for Northern Ireland on 27 February 1984 and laid before the House on 6 March. It is short and uncomplicated. It has the dual purpose of fixing the regional rate for Northern Ireland for the year beginning 1 April 1984 and also the amount by which that rate is to be reduced in respect of domestic hereditaments. That would usually constitute the totality of my opening speech in a debate such as this, but it may be of use if I give a little background and explanation to help the Committee in its consideration of the matter.<br><br>
The total rate liability of ratepayers in Northern Ireland is made up of two components. First, there is a district rate, which represents the contribution towards those services provided by the 26 local authorities, such as parks and cemeteries, recreation, cleansing and sanitation. Secondly, there is a regional rate, representing the contribution towards the cost of services now administered by central Government, but which before local government reorganisation in 1973 were administered by local authorities. That includes such matters as roads, housing, education, planning, health, water and sewerage and personal social services and child care.<br><br>
When responsibility for the major local authority services was taken over by central Government in 1973 considerations of operational and administrative efficiency dictated that they be integrated with existing services already under central Government control. It therefore became difficult—and within the conventions of central Government accounting, unnecessary—to separate expenditure on the individual services, which before 1973 had been rate-borne. Yet it was demonstrably right and proper that ratepayers in the Province continued to contribute towards the cost of those services in the same way as ratepayers in every other part of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The Government were at all times seized of the necessity to ensure that determination of the regional rate took proper account of special circumstances affecting the Province, did justice to Northern Ireland ratepayers and yet did not cause an excessively high share of the cost of the services to fall upon the generality of United Kingdom taxpayers. But, understandably, dissatisfaction about the initial mode of fixing the regional rate was often given expression by elected representatives, ratepayers' interest groups and individuals. This dissatisfaction arose not so much from informed judgment that levels were too high as perhaps
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
from a lack of clarity about the basis for the annual determination.<br><br>
There were several attempts at reform over the years, but these did not lead to radical change, chiefly because of the complexity of the matter and the apparent elusiveness of an objective, quantitative method that would satisfy all requirements. Nevertheless officials of my Department persevered in their work on the problem, in which they had the helpful and constructive advice and participation of elected representatives from the Association of Local Authorities in Northern Ireland, and in January 1983 published a consultation document proposing a new method for fixing the regional rate. Copies of that document were placed in the Library of the House in January 1983 and copies were also sent individually to hon. Members representing Northern Ireland constituencies.<br><br>
Essential features of the new method—which was used for the first time to fix the regional rate for 1983–84—are: first, that it establishes a clear relationship between estimated expenditure on "rate relevant" services and the fixing of the regional rate; secondly, that it provides for the calculation of notional rate support grant, by analogy with practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, to decide how much of rate relevant expenditure should be regarded as met by the taxpayer rather than the ratepayer. This takes account, among other things, of special features such as concentration of social problems and other components of disadvantage particular to Northern Ireland; thirdly, that the new method takes account of particular factors which make invalid the direct comparison of certain services in Northern Ireland with the analogous services in England and Wales. A good example is the police services in the Province. It would clearly be unfair to attribute to the ratepayer the whole of that burden because of the special security circumstances. Therefore the majority of that expenditure is set aside when calculating the regional rate. Finally, it provides a basis for fixing the regional rate that is more readily understood and transparent. Elected representatives and ratepayers who wish are now able to see for themselves the basis of the charges they are asked to bear and judge for themselves the fairness of the determination.<br><br>
This is the second time that this new methodology has been applied in respect of the year to come. The level of the overall Northern Ireland rate increase, that is of the regional and district rates combined is determined by the level of rate relevant expenditure in Northern Ireland and by the level of rate support grant for 1984–85. The decisions on public expenditure on rate relevant services were made in the context of the 1983 public expenditure survey, and details were announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in December 1983. The level of notional rate support grant at 84.3 per cent is by a considerable margin the highest of any region of the United Kingdom. The rate support grant levels in England, Scotland and Wales are 51.9 per cent, 60.2 per cent and 69.1 per cent respectively. The figure of 84.3 per cent illustrates very clearly the special circumstances and special needs of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
The result of the calculation based on the 1984–85 expenditure and on rate support grant of 84.3 per cent is an increase of 6.7 per cent in the overall Northern Ireland rate. The relative contribution to the overall Northern Ireland poundage of the district and regional rates is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
determined by the size of the average district rate. When the increase in the average district rate is below the increase in overall Northern Ireland rate, as happened this year, the regional rate increase is automatically higher than the increase in the overall average Northern Ireland rate. For 1984–85 the regional rate will increase by 7.8 per cent and this is provided for in the statutory rule being considered by the Committee.<br><br>
Domestic ratepayers benefit from domestic rate aid grant which reduces the poundage payable by domestic ratepayers, to a level similar to that in Great Britain. For 1984–85 this grant has been maintained at 12p in the pound, and provision has been made for this in the statutory rule.<br><br>
In a debate on an appropriation order in March 1983, the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) gave, I am glad to say, a broad welcome to the new system, but he expressed a desire that an explanatory document should accompany each rate demand. We have not lost sight of that proposal, but there are significant difficulties because of the short time available to determine the regional rate after all the necessary data have become available. I cannot make any specific announcement about this today, but I am considering the proposal further with my colleague, the Under-Secretary with responsibility for the environment, and I shall inform the right hon. Gentleman and any other interested hon. Member of the outcome. It is reasonable that we should see how far we can explain to individual ratepayers how the system works. I am not sure whether we can go as far as drawing attention to particular figures, as would be the case in Great Britain, because we are talking about notional rather than specific amounts. Nevertheless, I shall take the matter forward with my hon. Friend and see how far we can go.<br><br>
I have given some detail of the new method of determining the regional rate. It will have the benefit of relating directly to local authority spending incurred in Northern Ireland, and of ensuring through the definition of rate-relevant expenditure and the application of the rate support grant formula, that Northern Ireland's special needs are taken fully into account. It is fair to both the Northern Ireland ratepayer and to the United Kingdom taxpayer, who both make an appropriate contribution towards the financing of local authority type services in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I shall sum up briefly and, I hope, even more clearly. What now happens is that, as far as possible, Northern Ireland is treated in the same way as any other region of the United Kingdom in determining what the rate should be. Accordingly, I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.42 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Fatchett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his explanation of the order. As I stand here, I feel a certain sense of irony, because I vividly recall the 1979 general election when the Minister and I stood on opposing platforms. At that time, I hoped that the Minister would not be here to offer such a full and useful explanation to us this morning.<br><br>
My comments will be brief. There is no doubt that the Labour party is committed to a policy of public spending in Northern Ireland and throughout the economy in general. A lot of work needs to be done in housing, social services and the Health Service. Therefore, although my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
comments will be specific and will recognise the special needs of Northern Ireland, they will also be general because the Labour party is committed to an economic policy that stresses the importance of public spending. We derive some satisfaction from that fact that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland seems more committed to our economic philosophy than his colleagues in other Departments.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to reply to three brief topics. First, why has the rate level been set above the rate of inflation? The Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget statement referred to a rate of inflation of about 4 or 5 per cent, but the Northern Ireland ratepayer is expected to meet an increase of 6.7 per cent. In other words, the rate increase in Northern Ireland will be greater than the general level of inflation.<br><br>
My second question may offer an explanation to my first: why are the Government shifting the burden away from central Government to the Northern Ireland ratepayer? The figures provided by the Minister shows that the ratepayer's contribution increases from 15.18 per cent in 1983–84 to 15.67 per cent in 1984–85. In other words, the burden has been shifted from central Government to the Northern Ireland ratepayer, and that may be why the increase in the rates is above the general level of inflation.<br><br>
The shift towards the ratepayer is worrying, because we have seen it in England. When the Government took office in 1979, the general level of rate support in England was about 60 per cent. Now that figure is 51.9 per cent. Is it the Government's intention that there will be a similar reduction in Northern Ireland, and is it part of the Government's overall economic policy to shift the burden away from central Government on to ratepayers?<br><br>
There is a warning for the ratepayers of Northern Ireland from the experience of those in England. We have had many arguments in the Chamber about the increase in rates in England and the major reason for that increase was the reduction in Government support to ratepayers. If the same process is taking place in Northern Ireland, ratepayers there can look forward to no increase in services but a great increase in their rate burden. Will the Minister say not just why the shift has taken place but whether it is part of a long-term shift away from central Government support towards casting the burden on the ratepayer?<br><br>
Finally, will the Minister comment on what the shift in burden and the inrease in rates mean for industry in Northern Ireland? One often hears from the Conservative Benches that the increase in rate burden is generally unattractive to industry, that it leads to a loss of jobs and that it means that industry will not have the confidence to invest in new jobs, machinery or factories. Will the increase in rates and the shift in the burden away from central Government on to the taxpayer lead to a reduction in industrial confidence and to a loss of jobs? Conservative Members are keen on that argument in other parts of the United Kingdom. Does the Minister believe that it also applies to Northern Ireland?<br><br>
Those are my three specific questions. I welcome this opportunity, however brief, to debate rates in Northern Ireland. The matter is important because we are talking about substantial expenditure and a substantial burden on families and ratepayers. I believe that Parliament should have the opportunity of making that expenditure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
accountable, and by debate we can exercise that responsibility.</span></p>
<p>10.47 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Down, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How delightful it is, Mr. Leadbitter, to be able to come upstairs from the tumultuous and contentious debates in the Chamber on the subject of rates in order, in quiet and calm under your chairmanship, to be able to discuss rates.<br><br>
I was grateful to the Minister for agreeing to make a preliminary statement which was in many respects helpful to the understanding of the order, although I thought that perhaps he went beyond the permitted limits of understatement when he described it as uncomplicated and said that the method by which the rate was assessed was transparent. Apparently the Minister attaches different sense to the terms "uncomplicated" and "transparent" from those which probably most hon. Members do.<br><br>
The Minister's last remarks rather took away the edge of the first request that I intended to address to him, which was that we should have a rather better explanatory memorandum for such an order than that which appears on the verso. Admittedly it would be awkward and perhaps unusual if the explanatory note exceeded the order in length, but I think that this is one of those cases where that anomaly would be permissible.<br><br>
I appreciate the Minister's assurance that methods of offering an explanation intelligible to the ratepayer are still being considered between himself and his colleagues, but I should have thought that for the purposes of the House considering this order, annex .1 to the paper submitted to the Northern Ireland Assembly showing the heads of calculation would have been appropriate as an explanatory memorandum, and I hope that that may be considered in subsequent years. Certainly I found that annex extremely helpful in re-working the calculations and in arriving at one or two of the ponts that I want to put to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In those remarks, am I right in thinking that the right hon. Gentleman in concentrating solely on a better and fuller explanation to accompany the rates order itself? Would he have preferred to see an explanatory note that was somewhat longer and clearer than what has been provided for the purposes of this debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two issues. One is the enlightenment of hon. Members, and the other is the enlightenment of ratepayers. I appreciate that it is to the latter that the Minister and his colleague are addressing themselves—and very necessary and desirable that is. I was saying, as we are considering the order itself, that I feel we could have been helped more by a more extensive explanatory memorandum, and I hope that that hint may be taken.<br><br>
However, that being said, one cannot but agree that the new method being applied now for, I think, the second year following the consultative document of January 1983, is less opaque than the old method and that in some sense it attempts to relate the rate burden to expenditure upon services which in whole or part coincide with rate-borne or rate-related services in England and Wales.<br><br>
Nevertheless, there still remain obscurities, and I hope
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
that the Minister will be able to take the opportunity to clear up some of them. One is the mystery—at least it is a mystery to me—of how the percentage figure applied to rates-related expenditure, in this case 15.67 per cent, is arrived at. I think that that percentage was 14 per cent when the original calculations were made on the basis of the year 1981–82, and it was a lower figure in the current year when the new method was actually applied. Of course, this percentage is crucial. It purports to represent the ratio of rate to rate support grant in carrying the rates-related expenditures.<br><br>
However, I think that it would be helpful if the means by which that exact percentage was calculated could be displayed and perhaps briefly explained by the Minister. He said that it represented for Northern Ireland a higher rate support grant than that available in England and Wales but that still left us not understanding how the particular precise figure of 84.33 per cent. for the notional rate support grant in Northern Ireland was arrived at and why it was different from the percentage in previous years.<br><br>
I come to a second point of difficulty and, it may be, of inequity. The Minister explained very candidly that as for the purpose of these calculations we put together district council and the Northern Ireland Department's expenditure as one total, if the demands made by the district councils are less, the regional rate increases to make up for any restraint on the part of the district councils. On the face of it, it seems that if the district councils in Northern Ireland had complied with the main wishes of the Prime Minister and made every possible endeavour to keep their rate demands down in the coming year, the ratepayers would simply have been penalised by an automatic corresponding increase to fill the vacuum on the part of the regional rate. That may be implicit in the method of calculation, but it is a manifest inequity which I think will not be conducive to due economy and restraint on the part of the district councils in administering those relatively humble matters which are still left within their control.<br><br>
The third point that I would ask the Minister to deal with is the treatment of interest costs. For the purpose of these calculations, a sum is added to rate-related expenditure to represent what would have been the cost of interest on capital expenditures if the interest had been paid on the money borrowed to meet those expenditures. As those expenditures are met out of current Government funds, it is thought equitable that a notional rate of interest should be imposed upon Northern Ireland ratepayers. If I have followed that argument correctly, I beg leave to differ from it. What is happening is quite different. The Government are not borrowing the amounts which they spend in Northern Ireland upon capital projects.<br><br>
Of course if the Minister says, "Yes, we are, because we arbitrarily allocate part of the public sector borrowing requirement to the Government's capital expenditure in Northern Ireland," let him have joy of that argument. But if he chooses to use that argument, let me warn him that we shall claim that, at the most, even on that argument, only that percentage of the CGBR in respect of Northern Ireland capital expenditure which the CGBR bears to total public expenditure in the United Kingdom as a whole should be laid to the charge of the Northern Ireland ratepayer through these calculations.<br><br>
The ratepayer is being charged for interest which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Government are not paying. Consequently, the calculation is being shifted to the disadvantage of the Northern Ireland ratepayer. I am not sure whether I can see the Minister anxious to hop off his perch. I see that I was under a misapprehension, and I can well understand his readiness to retain the relative safety of the telegraph line, but perhaps he would count this as one of the matters that he would be good enough to clear up either when he replies to the debate or, if it is too difficult, later on.<br><br>
The de-rating of domestic premises is taken into account in the fixing of the rate in the calculations to arrive at the figures in the order. Would the Minister explain what happens about industrial de-rating? That may partly answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett). As I understand it, industrial premises in Northern Ireland are totally de-rated as one of the Government's measures to assist the economy of the Province. I am sure that it has been made clear that no part of the burden of that de-rating falls on Northern Ireland ratepayers. However, I cannot understand how that is achieved when industrial de-rating does not appear to have been taken into account in the calculation, although domestic de-rating has been.<br><br>
Finally, I come inevitably to the major subject of the fundamental impossibility, which all our endeavours go to illustrate, of running rate-borne services in the absence of the elected representatives of the ratepayers. I shall preface what I have to say on the subject by referring to a point made by the hon. Member for Leeds, Central, who asked why the rates continued to rise in Northern Ireland faster than the rate of inflation.<br><br>
Part of the answer may lie in the Minister's answer to my inquiry about why the assumed percentage representing rate support grant has diminished between next year and this year. But surely the main reason for the phenomenon to which the hon. Gentleman drew attention is that public rate-related expenditure in Northern Ireland has grown faster than the rate of inflation. If that were so it would, on these calculations, automatically produce an increased rate.<br><br>
In principle, I do not think that ratepayers in Northern Ireland would be disposed to quarrel if that were the significance of the increase in their rates and it corresponded with a greater effort of public expenditure in Northern Ireland than accorded with the rate of inflation. But they would still be justified in contrasting their lot with that of ratepayers in the rest of the Kingdom. They would say, "Satisfactory or not as this increase in public expenditure may be, it is an increase in public expenditure which owes nothing to our own decisions or those of our elected representatives, and we are therefore paying a tax which does not arise out of the decisions of those whom, as ratepayers, we elect to control and to explain expenditure."<br><br>
The Government are here confronting the consequences of one of their most paradoxical attitudes. They persistently state—this was in the Queen's Speech at the beginning of this Parliament—that their heartfelt desire is to give the people of Northern Ireland more control over their own affairs. There could be no more obvious or simple method of doing that than to entrust more services to the administration of the elected representatives of the ratepayers.<br><br>
It may be that it is a giant step that cannot be taken at once to shift rate-related expenditure as shown in this analysis from the control of Government and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
responsibility of this House to the control of elected bodies in the Province and therefore of the representatives of the ratepayers. But because all cannot be done at once, that can be no justification for doing nothing so resolutely year after year. I have to put on record on behalf of my colleagues and myself that at least part of the rate-related expenditure which underlies the calculations ought to be in the course of being transferred and ought to be perceived by the people of Northern Ireland as being transferred to the administration and the responsbility of those whom they elect locally.<br><br>
There is no substitute—so the Government have discovered—for the rating system if we are to have local government, but we in Northern Ireland turn the point of that proposition against the Government themselves and say that there is no ultimate justification for rating without local government. The two hang together, and the divorce between the two, however it arose historically—I know that it did not arise out of a decision of this House—in Northern Ireland is ultimately unjustifiable and ultimately results in an unintelligible burden being placed upon the ratepayer.<br><br>
So this morning we are doing two things. First, as parliamentary representatives of Northern Ireland ratepayers, we are trying to render more intelligible to ourselves, and thus indirectly to them, the method in which these arbitrary calculations are made. Secondly, we are inviting the Government to address themselves to a number of inequities which I have tried to define and which still appear to exist, despite the improvement in method introduced a couple of years ago.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will take the constitutional portion of my speech in the spirit in which it was meant, and that he will be able to deal fully and accurately, as is his custom in such debates, with the difficulties that some of us have encountered.</span></p>
<p>11.5 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(Londonderry, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with care to what the Minister said this morning. I have rarely heard, either in Committee or on the Floor of the House, a speech which so clearly exposed the absurdity of our present local government structure. The people of Northern Ireland elect an elaborate structure of local government, whose main functions are then calmly bypassed when it comes to the major concerns of local authorities on this side of the Irish sea, but the Minister has done the Committee a service by exposing that absurdity. Like my right hon. Friend, I hope that the Government will now start trying to improve the set-up.<br><br>
The ratepayers of Northern Ireland are being taxed, but are unable to decide how their money should be spent. It is all very well to say that the roads authorities, the housing executives, the education authorities and all the rest are open to consultation, and that officials sometimes come along to talk to local councils about their plans for the coming year. That is a very far cry from the elected representatives determining priorities for expenditure.<br><br>
We, as Members of Parliament, so often find ourselves doing what could—and most certainly should—be the job of county councillors and local councillors in Northern Ireland, and burdening Ministers with local problems. Decisions are being made at ministerial level that a middle-tier level of local government would make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
not only more quickly and easily but with far more sensitivity. There would be much more support from those on the ground, who would be able to put their point of view to a councillor with a detailed knowledge of the subject under consideration. At present, it is impossible for a Member of Parliament—with duties in the House and outside—to have a detailed knowledge of what is, in my case, a very large geographical area. We do our best, but we cannot help feeling that our constituents suffer from the lack of a proper system of local government.<br><br>
I listened with interest to the Minister's explanation of how the regional rate was decided, and how the total of regional plus local rate was calculated. I shall read his speech with care, and I think that all Northern Ireland Members should give it their consideration.<br><br>
I am not yet sure what is the Government's policy on the regional rate. In 1976–77, the regional rate was 48p in the pound. It is 93.33p for the coming year. That is rather below the overall level of inflation for that period, which can only mean that expenditure on local government services in Northern Ireland is being met in some other way. I do not think that the Minister will say that total expenditure over that period has dropped very much, but what one can say is that the local councillors have run a very tight ship in most local councils in regard to local government expenditure.<br><br>
For the coming year my own council—I could have checked the other councils in my constituency if I had known the reason that the Minister would give this morning—has a 1.6 per cent increase in the local rate. The Minister told us this morning that, when the average local council rate increase is below a certain figure, all that happens is that the saving is shifted over to the regional rate, and the regional rate plus the local rates on average reach a certain percentage figure, which, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) said, is well above the current level of inflation.<br><br>
If one looks at this from the point of view of my local Limavady council, one discovers that inevitably, because it has held its local rate down, it must be subsidising other councils, because apparently it is reckoned on the average local council increase. If that is not so, I shall be glad to hear it, and so will my local councillors. If it is as I have expressed it, one must expect that in future years those councillors who have deliberately been running a very tight ship will have the incentive to do so taken away. It is a very serious matter that, when a council tries to make a saving and to hold the rate down for the benefit of its own people, it then finds that it has been wasting its time because the Government will get their pound of flesh in any case through the regional rate. It is quite unfair and it is something that the Government must take a careful look at, because it will store up an enormous number of problems for the Minister once the local councillors discover what is going on.<br><br>
I cannot understand either what the Government's long-term policy is in regard to the regional rate. Do they intend to increase the overall rate burden purely in line with inflation or have they another intention? Perhaps we could be told exactly what their policy is in that respect. Real increases in expenditure do not take place uniformly in the different councils in Northern Ireland. Each council has different expenditure and different peaks and troughs from year to year. We should like people in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
councils to have a clear understanding of what is going on and where savings can be made.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will recall that in the Northern Ireland appropriation debate I raised what I saw as an inequity in the Coleraine council area because of the vast number of tourists who visit that area each summer. The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that the tourists brought a lot of money into areas such as Coleraine as well—as costing money in additional services which had to be provided. Tourists may come and spend money in such tourist-related areas, but the difficulty is that the money they spend does not go into the pockets of the rates office but into the pockets of the shopkeepers and other retailers in the area. Given the weather in Northern Ireland, the tourist season there is at most only three months long each year, and the shopkeepers naturally have to make hay while the sun shines. But for the rest of the year the tourist trade does not exist and retailers in that area depend on the local population.<br><br>
The Government cannot get away by saying in such a case, when the population increases by 50 per cent for two or three months of the year, that it is just their misfortune that they have to provide extra services for tourists for that short period. There is a case to be answered. A good case has been made by the Coleraine council—especially by the council officers—regarding extra help for the area in the provision of those services.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will go back and take a careful look at the problem to see what can be done to help, because the local rate in Coleraine is rather higher than in Limavady, and I think that that can largely be attributed to the costs of providing services and so on for the tourist industry.<br><br>
I have always had the problem of the inequity created by a regional rate and a local rate in my mind. The valuation officers in one local council district show equity, I am certain, to all ratepayers regarding the valuation of their premises. This is an old chestnut with me; it has been raised before, and I have never been satisfied with the answers which I have received.<br><br>
The problem arises because the regional rate is taken over Northern Ireland as a whole, on the poundages in each individual council area. But the valuation officers who do the valuations in Belfast are not the same officers who do them in Londonderry, Armagh, Strabane or wherever; different people are involved. While officers in the local areas show equity within their area in regard to the valuation levels, it canot be true that the valuation levels for similar premises are the same throughout the Province. But everyone pays the same regional rate.<br><br>
There is a problem in that, which can probably only be resolved in the long-term by two methods: first, by having very careful, close interaction between the valuation officers in the different areas and, secondly, by having a system of local government for Northern Ireland where those matters may be aired and the views in the various areas may be fed into the central body, so that measures can be taken to alleviate inequity and the difficulties of ratepayers throughout Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I finish as I began by saying that a lot of the difficulties—in the rating structure and of convincing people in Northern Ireland that the rates are properly spent and that rate expenditure is held down as much as possible—arise from the fact that the folk there cannot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
see a direct link between the rates which they are asked to pay, especially at regional level, and the expenditure of those rates on the services which the electorate demands.</span></p>
<p>11.18 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been accused in the House on occasion of introducing local government business into the House of Commons. The reason for that, of course, is that we have no other forum where we can raise certain matters in connection with the problems of our constituents.<br><br>
On this occasion, we are dealing with the items which refer to the district councils as well as to the United Kingdom. Perhaps I may tell the Committee what a council does when striking the rate. The finance committee sitting to strike the rate is working in a complete vacuum because it deals only with recreation, emptying bins and burying the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And bus shelters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not bus shelters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have disagreements while we are debating these crucial matters, but in the end we agree to strike a rate. The council of which I am a member generally tries to stay within the guidelines laid down by the Government and we do not increase it by more than the suggested percentage.<br><br>
During our debates we never know what the other part of the equation, the regional rate, will be because that cannot be struck until we have decided what the district rate is. Therefore, we work in a complete vacuum. The district councils look after about three items, but the regional rate looks after 19 items. I should like to know whether items such as travel concessions for pensioners come into the calculations for the regional rate, because they are included in it for the rest of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
This subject is definitely not uncomplicated or transparent. We could probably discuss it for hours and hours and many people would not understand what we were talking about. However, my main problem as a councillor is with the regional rate in Northern Ireland and the items covered by that: education, roads, housing, rural drainage and urban drainage. I am not referring to the police service or civil defence. Incidentally, we do not expect much civil defence in Northern Ireland because the money allowed for it is very low. Perhaps that is a bonus. Of the money allowed for the police service, only one third is for normal policing; the other two thirds are for the present situation in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) said, if district councils try to keep their rate down they are faced with the prospect of regional rates being higher. I do not go all the way with what he said because there are benefits for a council that keeps its rates down. However, although it is not strictly true, they feel that they are in the situation that keeping rates down will mean higher regional rates.<br><br>
I know that it was suggested that the new methodology of assessing the rates should last for one year so that we could examine it and see what we thought about it. The Minister referred to this being its second year. Are we going to look at it before it continues or does he intend to let it run for five years? It was also said that we could look forward to lower rates when the new methodology was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
used. The Minister shakes his head, but I have a document which infers—I put it diplomatically—that we would have a lower rate with the new methodology. That has not happened this year.<br><br>
It has been said that the Government are shifting the burden from the central Exchequer to the rates. We are in greater difficulty in Northern Ireland, because if we have to raise more on the district than on the regional rate, we shall be looking for greater representation for locally elected representatives than we have at present.<br><br>
Personally, I favour a different method of raising the money for the Exchequer. One thinks of a widow living in a house that has been the family home. She is paying the same rates as the family next door in a similar house, where there are four wage earners. It seems unfair that her burden should be the same.<br><br>
I support what my hon. Friends have said about local council powers. I have suffered—I use the term deliberately—as a district councillor in Northern Ireland for three or four years, the slings and arrows of constituents who have complained to me about matters of housing, roads and so on over which we have no control, at least in Northern Ireland. I have suffered at times the indignity of pursuing problems with Departments and trying to get a problem resolved, and being given the runaround—on occasions, not all the time.<br><br>
The time has come when we in Northern Ireland should be given more power to look after the interests of our people.<br><br>
May I make one specific point about valuation rather than the rate lifted by the valuation? A shop in a redevelopment area which has lost 50 per cent to 60 per cent of its trade has to pay the same rate as it did during the years when it did 100 per cent trade. It will be paying the same proportional rates as a larger shop, or the same size of shop in a better area. That is most unfair. Is there any way in which we could give those people some relief, other than by a general revaluation?</span></p>
<p>11.29 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make only a short intervention to ask the Minister for guidance on two issues.<br><br>
First, during his opening remarks, the Minister made reference to the notional rate support grants for Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales. I am not questioning his figures, but he will be aware that I have constantly asked for more specific figures when making such comparisons.<br><br>
Recently, I gather that in <i>The Times</i>—admittedly among other matters—figures were produced showing that per 1,000 people Northern Ireland did not head the grand list. Could the Minister give some clarification about regional support? As I understand it, Northern Ireland was related to Humberside in an attempt to strike an equitable rate. I was told that that was the region used, but I should be happy to have guidance if I am wrong. Is it possible to compare an area in England or Scotland with an area in Northern Ireland, so that the notional rate support percentagewise can be compared with Northern Ireland?<br><br>
There is another aspect on which I have not yet found a satisfactory answer, for when colleagues have raised the question of reduced fares or free transport for pensioners in Northern Ireland we are constantly told that elsewhere
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0089">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
in Britain it comes from rates. Will the Minister tell us whether any consideration has been given to calculating the amount needed from district or regional rates and whether consideration has been given to introducing support for pensioner travel in Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p>11.31 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. K. Harvey Proctor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to intervene briefly so that the record does not show that the voices calling for greater spread of responsibility to councillors in Northern Ireland only comes from the Opposition. On the Conservative Benches there is a feeling that it is absolute nonsense to continue with the position whereby councillors in Northern Ireland deal only with the limited range of matters set out by Opposition Members—recreation, burying the dead, emptying of bins and a small number of other issues.<br><br>
The Government should move towards transferring additional responsibilities on what are now regional matters back to the districts, and indeed think of setting up a regional tier of local authority in Northern Ireland. I am sure that Conservative Members do not believe that councillors in Northern Ireland do not have the expertise and common sense to run their affairs. It is nonsense that, however well right hon. and hon. Members from Northern Ireland represent their constituencies on local government matters, these matters should not rightly be considered, debated and decided by local elected councillors.</span></p>
<p>11.33 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take the opportunity to express my own frustration, the frustration of the Larne borough council and the members of other councils in Northern Ireland where a deliberate effort was made to hold the rates, only to find that when the regional rate was struck the overall rate went through the ceiling.<br><br>
I also serve as vice-chairman of the North-Eastern Education and Library Board, a completely undemocratic body which would not be accepted anywhere in England, Scotland or Wales, which we have somewhat timidly put up with for the past 10 or 11 years, but which we feel should be seriously looked at to enable the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland to determine how moneys should be raised and how that money should be spent for the benefit of the citizens there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to respond as fully as possible; however, before I do so, may I reciprocate the pleasant remarks made by the hon: Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett). I am reminded of the time a few years ago when we met on another platform. I am sure that he will not interpret it personally when I say that I hope we shall continue to meet in similar circumstances to those at present if he is content to occupy that side of the Committee Room or Chamber of the House.<br><br>
On the general point, I was taken to task for using two words—one was "uncomplicated" and the other "transparent". As so often happens in the course of a speech, single words are picked out and used in the wrong context. Just to clear my own reputation with regard to judgment, I referred to the order as not being
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
complicated, and I believe that the very simple order that we have before us is uncomplicated. In using the word "transparent"—and I checked it carefully—I was using it in the context of the new methodology as being more readily understood and transparent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Less opaque.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The word "more" clearly applied both to the readiness of the understanding and to the transparency. One can see through a glass darkly or more clearly. I hope that, with the use of the new methodology and the explanation that I was able to give, at least the transparency of that particular glass is somewhat improved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister honestly say that he can see more clearly now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a man of brevity and I hope, occasional wit. The brief answer is yes. However, if someone were to ask me whether the whole matter of local government expenditure and the way in which rates were raised was simple, I should answer with equal brevity that it is not and that it is enormously complex. I certainly do not claim to be an expert on these matters. Nevertheless, I shall try to respond. Some important points have been raised and if I do not respond to them all it will either be through ignorance of the answers or because the Committee felt that I was taking up too much of its time.<br><br>
Before I come to specific points I should like to tackle the constitutional matter. It might be argued perhaps that it was just on the edge of order as far as the rate was concerned but nevertheless it has been raised and it calls for an answer. It is not the first time that the matter has been raised, either in Committee or on the Floor of the House. I perhaps have to give the same answer that I have given before.<br><br>
I am glad, incidentally, that my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Proctor), made the remarks that he did to demonstrate that there are differences of view on the Government Benches. My answer has to be that I agree that there is a case for the devolution of powers to local authorities or to locally elected representatives in Northern Ireland. Whether the structure is absolutely right is obviously a matter for debate. But at present far too many matters are dealt with under direct rule. Arguably, with the devolution of power to the Assembly, those matters might still be too contained centrally and some of them might be devolved further. However, I believe that we have to tackle matters one at a time.<br><br>
I have to tell the Official Unionist party in particular that the Assembly is there and that there are opportunities for all those relevant matters to become once again the responsibility of the locally elected people of the Province. It would be stretching the rules of order too far if I pursued that subject. However, that option is available. The basic argument that such matters should be in the hands of those who represent the people of Northern Ireland is indisputable and totally acceptable. That objective can be achieved through the Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Proctor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the Assembly is a dead letter? However, there is a possibility of devolving more powers to the local authorities in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0090">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
future. Surely a more meaningful development of the spread of decision-taking in Northern Ireland lies in that direction and not with the Assembly which is virtually dead, as everyone knows.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the proposition that the Assembly is a dead letter. However, perhaps I would be wiser to hurry on to discuss the more specific issues raised by the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister consider that the area boards—which are quite undemocratic institutions in Northern Ireland—should perhaps be replaced and their functions carried out by the Northern Ireland Assembly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must be reasonably careful. The debate has somewhat widened and the Chair understands the reasons why it is prudent to allow some flexibility. However, if the Minister were to pursue that subject it would be more than the Chair could tolerate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should hate to risk being chastised by you, Mr. Leadbitter, although I know that you would do so with extreme kindness. However, I heed what you say and shall concentrate on the points raised so far.<br><br>
The first point is the somewhat difficult assertion in my speech that if the district rate were struck at a lower figure, there would be an automatic increase in the overall rate to be levied. One or two hon. Members, arguing for their constituencies on behalf of their local councils, reckoned that that was extremely unfair and appeared to be of no benefit to a thrifty council which had looked after its expenditure—indeed, one was cited as having increased its own rate by as little as 1.6 or 1.7 per cent. However, there is a benefit to the ratepayers from the thrift of the totality of district councils and, especially, of an individual council.<br><br>
I shall explain—I hope correctly—how the system operates. It starts from the planned expenditure for the forthcoming year in question. It takes into account the public expenditure figures—which I mentioned in my speech as having been announced at the appropriate time by my right hon. Friend—and also the estimates provided by the district councils. In no other way can the total figure be arrived at for overall public expenditure in the Province. Next, the overall total Northern Ireland rate revenue requirement is assessed by use of the notional rate support grant. Then, the actual revenue is deducted from that which will result from the rate that has been struck, as opposed to the estimates by the district councils. Only if the average rate struck is lower than the estimate will there be an increase in the regional rate figure. I believe that that is correct. There has to be a relationship between the two. So, the process starts with the total public expenditure planning figures and then the total Northern Ireland rate revenue requirement. If that from the district councils is lower, as a result of the final rate decisions, the other will automatically be higher. In practice, if the estimates are close to—or, indeed, the same as—the revenue which is estimated to accrue from the rate that is struck, the change is minimal or nil. If a council strikes a rate which is lower than the average, plainly ratepayers in that area will benefit. I hope that that will remove at least one worry from hon. Members' minds.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Molyneaux <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the position the reverse of that in Great Britain where councils are keepig their expenditure below a certain level? Would not it help if today on the Floor of the House we extended the rate-capping measures to the Northern Ireland Office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not rise to that bait although I shall have to come to it in a moment.<br><br>
What matters is that the end result in Northern Ireland is the same as that in Great Britian in relation to ratepayers. The way of arriving at the rate that they pay overall differs in the way that I have described. That was perhaps the most difficult problem with which I had to deal. I have plenty more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has dealt with the subject but he has not made me any happier. My personal rate—if I may declare a local interest—is up by 1.6 per cent. I still feel that my council and others like it, whose rises are consistently below the average, are subsidising the more spendthrift councils. If the thing is evened out on average between all councils, that is fair enough. The hon. Gentleman spoke of all councils. I am speaking of individual councils that are thrifty and which I feel come out of the equation much worse than those that spend money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that to be so. The hon. Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) should be grateful to his council for keeping the rate burden as low as it apparently is, and he benefits accordingly.<br><br>
The overall rate percentage increase is arrived at. We do not have to look at what the regional rate percentage is. Those two components make up the rate burden for the individual ratepayer. So in the hon. Gentleman's case there is the percentage figure of increase for the regional rate that has been arrived at and, separately, the 1.6 per cent or 1.7 per cent which his district council has arrived at. That is where we come very much in line with the equivalent in Great Britain of, generally, the county council rate added to the rate struck by the district council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Proctor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I have understood that correctly, any saving by one district council is spread across the totality. Therefore, when I tell Basildon district council that I want it to save money, the ratepayers in my constituency will have the full proceeds of the saving that I manage to secure from the district council. What my hon. Friend said in relation to Northern Ireland is that he supports and congratulates the savings by one local authority but that the ratepayers in that council's are a benefit to the tune of only one twenty-sixth of the saving. That is not equitable. Surely a more equitable scheme could be produced for Northern Ireland—a scheme similar to that in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the system is fair. We are discussing the way of arriving at the regional rate in the county council example for Great Britain. A county council looks at its expenditure and strikes it own rate. In this instance we have to arrive at a rate that is somewhat comparable to the county council rate—namely, the regional rate—and arrive at it in the way that I have described. The individual district council, through its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
thrift or otherwise, makes a contribution to the average increase. The totality of the district council's expenditure is added to central Government or "regional" expenditure. The percentage average increase of the district rate allows one to arrive at the percentage increase of the regional rate. That identifies the regional rate which is the equivalent of the county council rate. The individual rate struck by the district council is then added to that figure, so that there is no inequity for the ratepayer.<br><br>
I suggest that I write to those who would like to understand the matter simply and clearly—although I believe that I have been relatively simple and clear giving an exact explanation so that there is no sense of grievance on behalf of those right hon. and hon. Members who represent Northern Ireland constituencies nor any lack of understanding by any hon. Members who are immediately interested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to ask the Minister to give way again but I fear that the issue has become less transparent as time has passed.<br><br>
The parallel with the county and district councils in England is not relevant. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that in England, ratepayers of a thrifty district council will gain the total benefit and that the county council rate will be a separate rate, not influenced by the rate set by the district council. The two rates will be joined together and the ratepayer will pay them as one bill but they will be two independent and separate rates determined by two different local authorities.<br><br>
However, my understanding is that in Northern Ireland, the benefit of a thrifty district council will be shared among the other district authorities in terms of the calculation of the regional rate. Therefore, the parallel does not exist. In Northern Ireland the benefit of thrift will not go 100 per cent to the district council ratepayer but only partly, and therefore there will be an inequity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman's interpretation is correct. Nevertheless, the regional rate, once arrived at, is analogous to the county council rate, not least in that the same level of rate applies regardless to all district councils, so that each ratepayer picks up his share of that bill. To that share is added the greater or less bill, depending on the rate struck by his district council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister produces the letter which he has promised, will he bear in mind that he is trying to cope with the difficulty that the whole of the Exchequer support to those services in Northern Ireland, whether they are services provided by the district councils or otherwise, comes from the one source? This is what creates his obligation to take district council expenditure and add it in with the remainder in order to arrive at the regional rate, so that he is back to his primal fault, namely, the absence of separate responsibility and therefore of separate attribution of Exchequer money to the operations of the local councils, which does not exist in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite prepared to try to tackle that problem in the note of explanation that I shall circulate.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Down, South raised the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
point about explanatory notes and tackled it in two parts. If it is the wish of the Committee, there is no reason why in future greater explanation should not be given, even if it is not directly attached to the order. For the sake of clarity it might be helpful and it would at least save my breath, so I shall see whether something on the lines suggested by the right hon. Gentleman is possible.<br><br>
With regard to explanatory notes for ratepayers, I have dealt with that matter and said that I am looking at it with my hon. Friends. In fact, we have provided the Association of Local Authorities with figures that give a good indication of what is involved. We shall have to see whether it is possible to provide that information to individual ratepayers, partly because the figures are notional and could be misleading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Biggs-Davison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Epping Forest)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend take note of the view expressed on the Conservative Benches from time to time, that these matters will become much clearer and easier to understand when Northern Ireland has an elected regional council, whether it is based on adaptation of the Northern Ireland Assembly or whether it is liable to rate-capping? The regional council will be able to place its precept on the district councils, using the analogy of the county council which my hon. Friend used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of my hon. Friend's views, which he always puts to me with the greatest courtesy. We may not entirely agree on these matters. I do not necessarily agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Proctor), but he asked whether I would take note, and I do.<br><br>
I was asked how we arrived at the 15 per cent or so or the 84 per cent or so of regional support grant in respect of Northern Ireland. It is arrived at in the same way as regional support grant for any other part of the country. If the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) and other Committee members would like another note, I am happy to provide it but this is a long established methodology. The important point is that, in arriving at the notional regional support grant for Northern Ireland, we take into account its needs and circumstances. The most important point is that the figure is so much higher than the average for England, Wales or Scotland. I can tell the hon. Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) that there is no region in Great Britain, and so in the whole of the United Kingdom, which has a higher regional support grant than Northern Ireland. I think that his reference to Humberside was in connection with the old system. Certainly no analogy can be drawn now, and no figure for a direct assessment for Northern Ireland can be or should be drawn from a region in Great Britain, because circumstances will be different.<br><br>
That may have seemed worth while at one time. The new methodology allows us to look at Northern Ireland's problems, and at the needs allowance which would be forthcoming in similar circumstances in Great Britain, and to treat Northern Ireland accordingly. We may be able to refine it, but we should surely be aiming to treat Northern Ireland on a par with other regions in Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is that formula and the manner in which it is applied to Northern Ireland which is the piece of information which hon. Members and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
possibly ratepayers feel that they are missing. Could that be taken into account when the Minister is discussing with his right hon. Friend the whole matter of transparency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite confident that, as the Committee sees, the matter becomes clearer. While it has taken me many minutes to explain one point, it might be difficult to explain, in the space available on a piece of paper, to the individual ratepayer exactly what lies behind this proposal. In the end we might come down to a statement similar to that which I made a few minutes ago—that the reason for the new assessment of rates is that the ratepayers will be treated as they would be in Great Britain. The statement might enlarge a little on that, but a statement as simple as that would be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister prepares that letter, he might consider the figures that I think that civil servants have provided, and which <i>The Times</i> published, which show comparable relationships between the regions. They show that we are in economic difficulties with high unemployment, lower social benefits, and being mid-way down the cheap housing lists. Those factors bear on local rates and valuations.<br><br>
It would be interesting to have that comparison. We have been told that comparisons with regions were not possible, and that figures were given for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, individually, even though the populations are different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) because it was he who referred to Humberside, not the hon. Member for Londonderry, East. I shall not commit myself on that point, but we shall go as far as we reasonably can in this now famous note of explanation.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) asked how interest was treated. All that happens in that regard is to devise as closely as possible a position analogous with Great Britain. As the right hon. Gentleman reminded us, interest is taken into account on the borrowings of local authorities. As that expenditure is incurred by the Government in arriving at the regional rate, it makes sense to use a notional interest figure to keep the analogy with Great Britain as close as possible.<br><br>
I fear that I do not intend to be drawn into a long argument about the implications on PSBR, or the central Government borrowing requirement, where the interest must be carried. If the right hon. Gentleman really would like a response to his question, which is enormously complicated, I shall write to him. However, for the sake of this debate and for greater clarity for the representatives of Northern Ireland ratepayers, let me say that we are trying to treat those ratepayers in the same way as ratepayers in Great Britain, where that expenditure attracts interest. Therefore, we should count in that interest in arriving at the level of the regional grant applying to Northern Ireland ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Minister for saying that he will write to me about this matter. However, there is one simple point. On the mainland, the expenditure on interest is actually incurred. Those sums are actually borrowed, and interest has to be paid on that capital, whether the local authorities borrow
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
it on the market or from the banks, which I think they do at the margin, or whether they obtain it from central Government, which, in turn, shows it as part of their borrowing requirement. In relation to Northern Ireland, the sums actually are not borrowed. There is no borrowing, and no interest burden is incurred. That is the point to which I hope the Minister will direct his attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But surely, if the expenditure was being incurred by a notional local authority, interest could expect to be paid. We do not know whether, in practice, it would be taking that money out of reserves or how it would be borrowing. We know only that in Great Britain such and such happens. The interest burden that is borne in Great Britain is an average of so much. We use that figure and apply it to a hypothetical situation in Northern Ireland. That seems straightforward and one of the many things that must be done to try to obtain a figure that is as accurate as possible. As has been said, similarly, the whole of the cost of the police cannot be attributed to the Northern Ireland ratepayer because he would be carrying a much heavier burden than his counterpart in Great Britain, so we apply only a minority proportion of that expenditure on the police—again a judgment must be made—to arrive at the most closely analogous figure as possible. Therefore, I do not believe that there is great difficulty in respect of the remarks of the right hon. Member for Down, South about CGBR. Certainly, I shall look at that to see whether I can help him out and educate myself at the same time.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) mentioned the burden on industry, which was dealt with subsequently. Of course, we do have 100 per cent industrial derating, as part of the incentive package that was improved upon by the Government about this time last year. It certainly helps the cash flow of industry and is generally widely welcomed. That burden does not fall on the ratepayer. Any resulting loss of income is charged against the industrial development budget and is seen as part of the whole support for industry. The ratepayer is not penalised through a reduction in rate revenue resulting from industrial derating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say whether the relevant cost is not included at all in the rate-relevant total of expenditure or whether it is taken account of through an adjustment of the notional rate support grant?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure which. The important point is that the derating does not penalise the ratepayer. It is a charge against the industrial development budget. I can easily answer the hon. Gentleman's question, but not out of my head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps when the Minister replies to the point raised by my hon. Friends he will indicate the further costs which might be incurred if consideration was given to derating the service sector of industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are getting far from the central issue, but that point has been raised before. I have explained that the industrial derating cost is a charge on the industrial development budget. Therefore, it follows that if derating were to be applied in any other sector, it should also fall on the industrial development budget. In our judgment that is not a priority; indeed, we have argued
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1983-1984V012P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
strongly that in the case of some of the service sector no support is justifiable, for reasons which I think the hon. Gentleman knows well.<br><br>
Before the intervention I was coming on to the first two questions asked by the hon. Member for Leeds, Central: why was the level set above the rate of inflation and why was there a shift of the burden away from central Government? The increase in rate-relevant expenditure is 5 per cent plus. That is above the figure which the hon. Gentleman credited to the Chancellor of the Exchequer of 4 to 5 per cent. If, therefore, there is to be an increase in public expenditure in real terms and if, as is the case, the ratepayer contributes towards that—that is what this debate is about—it follows that the increase in that rate will be higher than the rate of inflation.<br><br>
There is also, however—this is the subject of the hon. Gentleman's second question—a reduction throughout the United Kingdom in the rate support grant. In Northern Ireland that reduction is mathematically exactly the same as that applying in other regions and is part of Government policy on public expenditure. Therefore, two elements make up the small increase—and it is small—above the anticipated increase in inflation.<br><br>
But surely there are two points which are much more relevant in the argument. First, the Government have reduced inflation to its present level and intend to hold it down further if they can. We are talking now about rates of inflation which are way below the expectations of even a year or two ago and certainly way below the rate of inflation at that time. That surely has to be more relevant than this small difference. Secondly, thanks to the high level of rate support grant in Northern Ireland, the individual ratepayer is paying a much smaller contribution towards rate-relevant expenditure than his counterpart in Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would I be right in saying that the Northern Ireland ratepayer does not get a pound's worth of increased service for every additional pound paid and that because of the cut in the rate support grant he will pay more than he should for the increase in services to which the Minister referred? The burden, regardless of the comments about inflation, is pushed on to the ratepayer so that he pays more than if that level of service had been provided during the financial year 1983–84.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is correct. The ratepayers of Northern Ireland make a slightly higher contribution towards expenditure than previously.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Forsythe) asked about half-price fares for pensioners and I shall have to answer that question later. I believe that that falls to the transport undertakings and will increase the loss and, therefore, the Government subsidy. It therefore falls direct on central Government and is not reflected in the rate burden. However, I must confirm that.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman challenged the basis of the rating system and I shall not be drawn on that. The Government made their pronouncement on that matter very firmly, however regrettably.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked how long the new methodology would continue. Despite the fact that not everything has been totally clear during our debates about the new methodology, in view of the welcome expressed by one or two hon. Members, including the right hon. Member for Down, South, I hope that at least the concept behind the new methodology is accepted. I hope that after a little more explanation there will be recognition of what we are trying to do and that we should persevere. It is the Government's intention to continue the new methodology at least for five years. In my experience it does not make sense to chop and change in such matters. I believe that there has been considerable improvement on the previous system and it would make even less sense to change at this stage. I hope that there is no underlying feeling that we should do so.<br><br>
I have dealt with all the points which I am capable of answering and have dealt fairly with those points which have been raised. Having made that point about the new methodology, given it general praise and given an assurance that it will continue for five years, I commend the motion to the Committee.</span></p>
