</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 138, as will be immediately clear, is merely a paving amendment, so my remarks will relate to amendments Nos. 139 and 142, which are the substantive amendments in the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 139 adds a further test that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"conviction was otherwise unsafe or unsatisfactory."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
It introduces a third criterion for assessing whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. The reason behind the amendment ought to be fairly clear: the appropriate test to be met in relation to appeals is contained in section 228(2) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975. I think that the provision should be supplemented by allowing the Appeal Court to overturn the conviction if it considers it unsafe. It is necessary for the Appeal Court to be able to remedy miscarriages of justice whether or not they fulfil the technical requirements of section 228(2). It is wrong in principle that the Appeal Court should uphold a conviction even if it is satisfied that the conviction is unsafe based on the evidence presented to the jury at trial. The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 should be amended to provide for the Appeal Court to overturn the conviction if it is considered to be unsafe in much the same way that the English system requires the English Court of Appeal to allow an appeal against conviction if it is considered unsafe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 142 follows on from amendment No. 139. It adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and a reasonable explanation may be without prejudice to any other explanation constituted by
	<ol>
	<li>the evidence in fact not being available at the trial; and</li>
	<li>the evidence not being disclosed by the accused as a result of undue influence.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment aims to add a definition of what constitutes a reasonable explanation of why evidence was not brought forward at the original trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Appeal Court should be able to hear additional evidence that was available at the time of the trial, provided that there is a good explanation for its failure to be produced in the original case. The current statutory provisions on additional evidence are contained in section 106(3) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. It is appropriate to concentrate on the words of the statute, which relate to the non-availability limit on the introduction of fresh evidence. The cases of Church and Elliott, both in 1995, are relevant. In the Elliott case, the court considered that the provision son additional evidence constituted as requirement that must be satisfied before the court could hear additional evidence. Therefore, whereas section 228 of the 1975 Act allows a review of any alleged miscarriage of justice, where that alleged miscarriage of justice relates to the non-production of additional evidence, the court is constrained by the terms of the statute to hear that evidence only if it was not heard at the trial and it was not available and could not reasonably have been made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the first report of the Thomson committee in 1971 suggested that additional evidence could be presented on the basis of a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence at the trial. The provision under section 228 (2) of the 1975 Act, from which the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 derives, was considered by the court in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
Elliott case. The Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Ross, was of the view that, because Parliament did not adopt the reasonable explanation test suggested by the Thomson committee and instead provided the wording currently contained in the statute, Parliament clearly intended the more exacting test. The decision in the Elliott case reaffirmed the law as it stood prior to the Church case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern has been expressed in a number of quarters that the High Court's interpretation of the additional evidence test does not meet the demands of justice. Indeed, Lord McCluskey has suggested in his book on criminal appeals that non-availability raises a simple question of fact: either the evidence as available or it was not. But one must also ask to whom it was available. Lord McCluskey concludes that availability must be considered from the appellant's standpoint, taking full account of what was practicable for him at the trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all the circumstances, the view taken in the Church case-a reasonable explanation for the failure to reproduce the evidence based upon a liberal interpretation of the statute-points to the route for reform. It is clear that the policy objective pursued by the Lord Justice-General is, in that case, the correct one and that the proper test for dealing with the problem raised in the Church case would be along the lines of an excusable failure to produce the evidence at the original trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That explanation comprises the case for the amendments. I very much hope that the Minister will take on board those sentiments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall add briefly to what the hon. Lady has said on amendment No. 57, which was tabled to tease out a definition of what constitutes a reasonable explanation of why evidence was not heard in the first proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 introduces a new subsection into section 106 of the Criminal Procedures (Scotland) Act 1995. That subsection would enable a person to bring an appeal based on a miscarriage of justice where, inter alia, significant evidence existed at the time of the original trial, but was not presented to the court, only if there was a reasonable explanation of why that evidence was not heard. The aim of the amendment is for the Minister to define a reasonable explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 120 and 122 are consequential on amendments Nos.57 and 121 being accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might assist the committee if I explain that it is not our intention to sit this afternoon or this evening during the Budget debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind clause 14 is to introduce a greater flexibility in the criteria on admissibility of
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
fresh evidence on appeal. the amendments however, would either restrict the criteria or their concerns are already covered by the provisions in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 139 is not fully clear. The issue of a conviction being unsafe or unsatisfactory can be fully reviewed within the general ground of appeal, namely that there has been a miscarriage of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Sutherland committee, albeit in the context of replacing the ground of appeal of "miscarriage of justice", argued that introduction into Scots law of the formulation of a conviction being "unsafe" would give rise to problems of interpretation. It recommended that the general basis for an appeal should remain that a miscarriage of justice had occurred and that this ground should not be qualified or limited in any way. That was accepted by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The committee did, however, go on to say that its conclusion that there should be one broad, unqualified, general ground of appeal, applicable to all cases, was not incompatible with the identification of specific examples of cases which could satisfy the general ground. It thought that this could be used to settle certain points of doubt in the current law and to give a pointer to future development of the underlying principle. The additional instance that amendment No. 139 attempts to introduce is clearly not of the specific concrete type of the other two instances in the Bill and could introduce, rather than settle, doubts about the basis of appeals. I therefore ask the hon. Lady not to press the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 57 and 121 would restrict the fresh evidence that the Court of Appeal could admit to only two particular circumstances, not achieving the breadth that we believe is appropriate and necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 142 would appear to introduce similar particular circumstances of evidence as in amendment No. 57, but would avoid restricting the fresh evidence that could be admitted by retaining the reasonable explanation test. It may be helpful if I explain the reasoning behind the reasonable explanation test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Sutherland committee, which recommended this test for the introduction of fresh evidence, also recommended that no attempt should be made to qualify or interpret the term "reasonable explanation". The committee believed that the ground for admission of fresh evidence should be flexible and it did not wish to try to circumscribe what might be a reasonable explanation in any particular circumstances. We, therefore, accepted this recommendation and the reasoning behind it, and believe that amendment No. 57 would not achieve the positive change that both the Sunderland committee and the Government wish to see in this area. Amendment No. 139 is unnecessary since the two particular circumstances raised by it, and also by amendment No. 57, should be readily encompassed by the wider "reasonable explanation" test. I therefore ask the hon. Members to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
Amendments Nos. 120 and 122 seem to exclude the Court of Appeal from considering evidence that was not admissible at the original trial but which would be admissible at the time when the appeal was heard. That could lead to injustice in some cases. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Dumbarton not to press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken half the Sutherland committee's recommendations and claimed them as their own in clause 14 and, in doing so, have gained the compliments of the legal profession—I understand that the Glasgow Bar Association complimented the Government on introducing clause 14. Although the Government are due credit for adopting the provisions, credit for creating them should go to the Sutherland committee, which issued its report in June 1996. However, it is surprising that only half of that committee's recommendations have been included in the Bill. The committee also recommended the creation of an independent body for special appeals, as has been introduced in England and Wales, where the right of the Executive the Secretary of State—to decide in the final event whether an appeal should be taken has been removed. The Sutherland committee recommended that there should be an independent body, so that even after three appeal judges have decided that no appeal should be heard, it would still be possible to go further without going back to a member of the legislature. If it was good enough in England and Wales, in dealing with the fraught cases of the Birmingham Six and other such cases, why has the Minister not proposed the same system for Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Sutherland committee also recommended that we should permit appeals based on a change of witness statements. For example, if a supergrass is involved in a case, and that person gives evidence that causes someone else to be convicted, but later admits that he was in the pay of the police—which would result in a change in the evidence—the Bill includes nothing that would allow the trial to be reheard. Clearly, in such circumstances, a witness has changed his evidence, but nothing is being introduced to deal with that, despite the Sutherland committee's recommendations. We have gone quite a long way with the Sutherland committee's recommendations. We generall take
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
cognisance of what such bodies say, and the Government have done that. But because amendments have not been accepted, we have been left with anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had no explanation from the Government of why they have not gone further. We need an independent body for all parts of the United Kingdom to deal with special cases where a political element may have let a conviction remain, such as the Birmingham Six case, which brought the justice system of England and Wales into disrepute. If such cases led to a change in the law in England and Wales, why did that not happen in Scotland? The Minister must address those matters. People reading this record of our proceedings will have half an answer and half an excuse of why he did not put into effect all the recommendations of the Sutherland committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the questions briefly. The same number of cases has not been overturned in Scotland as south of the border—as the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) will recall. The main reason for our decision is the growing concern about witness intimidation before a trial. Accepting a change of witness statement as a ground of appeal would increase to an unacceptable extent the risk of witness and victim intimidation after a trial. We are also not convinced that such a change is necessary. Where it can be established that a witness lied at trial and caused a miscarriage of justice, we are satisfied that that problem can be addressed by the existing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take account of the Scottish circumstances and the distinctive features of the Scottish criminal justice system. I see no need to follow slavishly what happens south of the boarder. We are justified in taking our course. The Sutherland committee adopted the right approach by using the reasonable explanation test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham) referred to the Church case. The High Court held that the relevant provisions were in place to enable evidence which was not available at a trial to be heard at an appeal where there was a reasonable explanation. That was followed in the case of Elliott, when a five-judge Bench said that in the Church case of the High Court was wrong in its interpretation of section 228 of the 1975 Act. The Bill amends that section to clarify the matter beyond any doubt and to enable evidence to be heard on appeal as long as there is a reasonable explanation of why it was not heard at the trial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the five-judge appeal body. The case was originally heard by the Lord President, Lord Hope, who wanted a more liberal interpretation of the miscarriage of justice rules. I and many people in the legal system in Scotland supported
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
him on that. The Minister must give us an explanation of what he means by "reasonable explanation". Paragraph 1(b) of the notes on clause 14 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"allowing evidence to be heard if there was a reasonable explanation".</p></blockquote>
We need to flesh out what that phrase means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to avoid a situation in which every case is subject to one long appeal and is not brought to an end within the justice system. I do not think that the public want that—they want certainty. However, if witnesses have been intimidated to the extent that they have given false evidence—and that can be substantiated by several other witnesses—that could be taken into account by a court as a reasonable explanation. It does not mean that, after a case, anyone can change his or her evidence and expect the process to be reopened. The Appeal Court would have to consider all circumstances to see whether there was a reasonable explanation. I would not wish to circumscribe its discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put this into context. The relationship between the procurator fiscal and the police in the investigation of crime and the rules of corroboration provide a necessary safeguard against miscarriages of justice in Scotland. The evidence that the Sutherland committee received was divided on the need for an independent body. Its report did not demonstrate any overwhelming pressure or compelling case for changing the miscarriages of justice procedures in Scotland. Our acceptance of almost all of the committee's recommendations on the appeals criteria should address the main concerns about miscarriages of justice. Rather than change the basis of the referral procedure when there is no overwhelming pressure to do so, we shall concentrate on improving the existing system. Therefore, a section within the Scottish Office has been set up to deal exclusively with miscarriage of justice petitions and policy and its performance is being closely monitored. Also, there is greater openness and disclosure when responding to petitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) asked me about "reasonable explanation". I believe strongly that that should be left to the Appeal Court, but I think that the circumstances mentioned in amendment No. 139 would qualify, as would the circumstances in the Church case. That case involved new video evidence becoming available. However, it is important that courts should be given maximum discretion with which to ensure that miscarriages of justice can be dealt with properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that the Minister appears to be digging himself in deeper. His explanation refers to his own limited argument. He mentioned the question of witness intimidation, trying
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
to put it into the context of someone having changed their evidence after the court case and saying, "I didn't mean to say that." Everyone know that the problem in Scotland is witness intimidation before the court case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worked with my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton on a crime and drugs campaign and met all the chief constables in Scotland, apart from two in West Lothian and Strathclyde who have changed recently—although I did meet the Strathclyde Police Association. They told me that, in Glasgow, two people who were witnesses to murders were killed. The evidence that most of us have of for example, very unruly neighbours where violence is involved is that the police often have a strong cause, supported by up to 20 or 30 witnesses. In a case in my constituency, all the witnesses eventually chickened out and the case could not be brought to court. The problem is getting the evidence to court in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendments Nos. 57 and 121, it states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"evidence had not been disclosed by the accused as a result of undue influence exerted by another person".</p></blockquote>
A similar subsection appears in amendment No. 142. We are talking about the original trial being distorted by the threat of violence from outside and by the pressure put on people's families and acquaintances if they give proper evidence in court. Moving on, someone might be willing to come forward with evidence because the person involved in the violence has been put in goal for another reason and, therefore, cannot issue threats. However, the Secretary of State for Scotland says that he will not allow such cases to be brought back to court as an appeal. That does not make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister had evidence to show that the police were working on the problem in Scotland and were preventing witness intimidation before the court case, we might not be so concerned. In reality the police are saying that they do not have the resources or the back up to prevent witness intimidation on a massive scale in Scotland. If the Minister wants to deal with the question of what is happening in Scotland, let us deal with the reality. Witness intimidation occurs in the original court case and is unlikely to happen after the conviction in an attempt to get them to come out in the open and say, "I gave false evidence in court." There is a strong case for the Minister to consider the amendments, which are well-drafted and which were well-argued by the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross and my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbarton. it is a pity that the Minister has resisted the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The body set up in England and Wales—the criminal cases review authority—has given some credibility to the legal system in England and Wales, which was deeply damaged by what happened over some prominent cases in England and Wales. It is nonsense for the Minister to say, "Well, we'll just keep our heads in the sand because we haven't had as many cases brought against the Scottish legal system".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
That suggest that it is good enough to divide the legislature and the judiciary in England and Wales, but that we do not give that as much credibility in Scotland. In Scotland people have more to say about the importance of keeping the Executive, the judiciary and the legislature apart to ensure a proper balance for a democratic society. We have the opportunity in the Bill to introduce a body that would provide that added credibility. If we ever faced a similar situtation, we would have a body that would be able to take the matter out of the hands of the Secretary of State and to deal with it independently, thereby giving greater credibility to what we do as legislators and to the judiciary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say that because not many cases have arisen the body is not necessary is nonsense and the Minister knows that. He argued that the Sutherland committee was not unanimously in favour of such a body, but there was clearly a lot of support for it. It was supported by the Law Society of Scotland, the Glasgow Bar Association and the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties. The Minister seems to be the only one who is not listening, and something is seriously wrong with the way in which the Government are dealing with the Bill. The Minister has the opportunity now to do something about that and I hope that he will take it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall read 	<i>Hansard</i> carefully. I was referring not to the hon. Gentleman's most recent contribution but to an earlier one in which I picked up that inference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to say that the hon. Gentleman widened the argument and said that pressure may come from two sides. Most frequently, the accused applies pressure on witnesses against him and that causes concern. The clause seems to refer to someone who has been wrongly convicted. If that is so, I appreciate that no one in the Committee or in the country would want that to be sustained. It is right that the matter
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
should be re-examined and a reasonable judicial judgment arrived at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other situation arises when someone is charged with a crime and is acquitted, but, at a later date, witnesses are found to have had pressure applied and the accused was wrongly acquitted. Would an appeal be available to the procurator fiscal? Would he be able to say that the acquittal was wrong and seek a retrial because witnesses were leant on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer my hon. Friend. It is within my knowledge that if allegations are made, the procurator fiscal service, the Lord Advocate and the Crown Office can and do carry out investigations to see whether criminal charges should be brought arising from the allegations. If there is insufficient evidence they do not proceed, but if there is sufficient evidence they do not proceed, but if there is sufficient evidence they will proceed and produce a report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that position in relation to a challenge against the evidence, but if there is a wrongful conviction, could the accused by brought to trial again on the charge of which he was acquitted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State can refer a case back to the Appeal Court for its consideration if he believed that there were reasonable grounds for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East referred to witness intimidation before a trial. Intimidation of witnesses can occur at any time, but the hon. Gentleman can be sure that if it occurs before a trial it could also continue after the trial if a change of statement were sufficient to sustain an appeal. Witnesses who are courageous enough to give evidence in spite of intimidation can at least rest somewhat easier when the trial is over. We must avoid making every trial last endlessly as a result of an endless succession of appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In support of our position, I must quote a document that was published by the Labour party in Scotland—no less—entitled, "Protection and Justice". It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is now some discussion as to whether or not it is appropriate to establish some form of independent review tribunal to consider cases in which there is continuing disquiet after the normal appeal system has been exhausted. While this may be necessary it is not without difficulty. If the power of the Appeal Court is increased that may in itself answer the problem and consideration of a further tribunal should be deferred until the effect of such increased power is seen in practice".</p></blockquote>
That is an altogether sensible statement and I notice that the hon. Member for Dumbarton wrote the foreword to the document. We do not think that it is necessary to create another quango. If reasonable grounds exist, the Secretary of State can refer a case to the Appeal Court, which he did recently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
to take part in the debate, but I have become increasingly disturbed by the comments of the Minister and the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie). However, there is nothing new in that—just about everything they say disturbs me!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from my constituency experience that when witness intimidation occurs, it does so, almost universally, before a trial. There are well-known characters in every constituency—they are know to the police, Members of Parliament and local councillors—who are never convicted in the courts, sent to gaol or made to serve a sentence. They organise drug supplies, intimidate local people and have the whole community so terrified that no one will stand witness against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police are powerless to act against those characters because they lack the resources to afford the witness protection that would encourage people to come forward and to give evidence. I shall not abuse parliamentary privilege by naming people in my constituency, but both the Minister and I know that they exist. Automatic sentences and mandatory sentences do not affect those characters—they are never convicted because witnesses are terrified to come forward and to speak out against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of cases in which people have been wrongly convicted of an offence that was committed by the characters that I mentioned. However, people have got them off by giving evidence that suggested that they were innocent, while others were too frightened to come forward and to give contrary evidence. The result is a wrongful conviction. Sometimes those characters die-perhaps from a drugs overdose or they might be murdered. That makes it possible for witnesses to come forward and to give evidence. I am worried because the Minister may be shutting off the possibility of appeal in cases where there is a wrongful conviction because people were frightened of a fanatic or maniac in the community. That fanatic might die-one such character died recently in my constituency—which would encourage witnesses to come forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Appeal Court might decide that endless appeals might result from a case, as the Minister said, which would build injustice into the system. I cannot believe that the Committee wants to go down that route. Surely we do not want innocent people who have been convicted. We should give every opportunity to release people who have been convicted unlawfully. Those people would be helped if the amendments were accepted, and the Minister should be prepared to take them on board. This is not America; in our system, not every case goes to endless appeals and it does not take 15 or 20 years before a final appeal is reached. In this country, we have a difference system and a different society, and we shall not end up with the situation that applies in America.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go along with much of what the hon. Gentleman said. if the appeal procedure were allowed
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
to drag on in cases in which witnesses have had the courage to come forward and to testify against the individuals to whom he referred, those individuals would give out constant threats even after their conviction. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the problem for the witnesses would be augmented if the amendments were accepted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detract from the courage of anyone who comes forward and gives evidence against those characters. However, in my experience, no one has such courage. The consequences of giving evidence against such people can be fatal, especially if the person giving evidence lives in the same community as those who are accused, does not have 24-hour protection, is not a Member of Parliament or someone they cannot touch, but is just an ordinary citizen. Not many Members of Parliament get attacked by these characters because the attackers know that the authorities will come down on them like a ton of bricks, but if they attack their fellow citizens who live in the same underprivileged areas, nothing hapens to them. That is not the fault of the police. The police do not have the resources to offer the necessary protection against these characters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It strikes me that the Minister is extending the statutory criteria for appeals within the system, which he claims is a good and positive move, in line with Sutherland committee's recommendations, but that when the Opposition suggest amendments to extend the critera to cover other cases, the Minister claims that they will restrict the right of appeal. The Minister cannot have it both ways. If our amendments restrict the right of appeal, so do his suggestions for change. Of course, neither will provde a restriction: the Minister's suggestions and ours will extend the criteria on which appeals can be heard. The extensions are necessary because people are wrongly convicted due to witnesses being intimidated by the real guilty person. It is time that the Government recognise that as the case and listen to what various organisations in Scotland tell them about this serious problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the debate, but I must make it absolutely clear to the hon. Gentleman that where somebody is acquitted—he used the expression "wrong acquittal"—the case cannot be reopened. The case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, which is one of the great safeguards, and the Secretary of State can refer to the High Court only miscarriages of justice which have led to a conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14(2)(5A) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Evidence which was not heard at the original proceedings may found an appeal only where there is a resonable explanation of why it was not so heard."</p></blockquote>
Matters of credibility at the original trial are for the jury to decide, having been directed by the judge on the law and the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to try again on the issue of reasonable explanation. The Minister knows that the debate in the past has been about the liberal interpretation of the law in referring cases for appeal. What is to prevent a court from interpreting "reasonable explanation" in a rigid, illiberal way, which could lead to the ossification instead of the liberalisation of the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scottish judges can be trusted to act reasonably in considering the expression "reasonable explanation". In a way, the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) made my arguement for me: he said that there is a risk of witness intimidation. I think that the risk will be enormously increased if we allow an endless series of appeals after every serious case. We believe that each case should reach a final conclusion unless substantial evidence becomes available. As I mentioned, the test is whether there is a reasonable explanation of why such evidence was not put before the original court. Matters can be referred, as happened a few weeks ago when the Secretary of State referred a case. That will continue to happen where there are reasonable grounds for such cases to be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press one more point? The Minister has not really returned to the question of the proposed crimial cases review authority. The submission by the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties is very worrying on close reading. It claims that about 50 persons every year attempt to ask the Secretary of State to have their convictions re-examinied by the Appeal Court, but that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"since the inception of this procedure in 1928, around only 16 cases have been referred to the Appeal Court by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That is the scale of people's feelings of injustice: of 50 requests per annum in the past 70 years, the Secretary of State has allowed only 16 to be referred. That demontrates the huge disparity between people's feelings of injustice and the redres given to such feelings by giving an elected person the power tod ecide whether there should be an appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have introduced more powers, making the Secretary of State the final arbiter in many amtters. Scotland is becoming a colonially run regime in which the Secretary of State acts like a governor general. The only thing that he is not allowed to do is call out the troops—he can do everything else in Scottish life. The Government have an opportunity to show that they are not adopting that approach and are addressing the sensible concerns of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, which wants an independent body to make the final decision. The question still sticks to the wall because the Minister will not answer it. Why is a review body good enough for 50 million people in England and Wales, but not good enough for people in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
Scottish system of criminal justice is as good as any in the world. Not only that, but when Viscount Runciman, chairman of the Royal Commission, looked into the circumstances north of the border, he acknowledged that the commission was attracted to featurtes in the Scottish system. He noted that it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"impressed to the point of envy by both the role of the advocates depute in prosecuting for the Crown and the role of the Procurator Fiscal in relation to the police."</p></blockquote>
I have great confidence in the Scottish criminal justice system. The Secretary of State can refer a case where there are reasonable grounds. As I said, a number of officials work on those matters in the Scottish Office. It should not be assumed that because someone says that he has not committed a crime after he has been convicted by a jury, he is innocent. I have known many defendants with a great deal of evidence against them which a jury considered sufficient to secure conviction. A convicted person might maintain his innocence, but that does not mean that he is innocent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend clarified a point when he suggested that those who have been wrongfully acquitted can not be retried. That worries me. It is right that those who have been wrongfully convicted should have their cases reconsidered, but criminal law is also about the rights of victims. If there are wrongful acquittals as a result of suppressed evidence or evidence coming to light at a later date which should have been considered at a trial, perhaps my right hon. Friend should take the opportunity to address that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much hope that the Minister will not take up that point. He must be well aware that, even though people might believe that an original not guilty verdict was wrong, it would be ludicrous to hound people through the courts until a guilty verdict was finally reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to press the Minister on the point made by the hon. member for Falkirk, East about the people since 1928 who have successfully managed to persuade secies of State to refer an appeal to the Appeal Court. In recommending that the independent body should be set up along the lines of the one in England and Wales, the Sutherland Committee concluded that
	<br><blockquote><p>"this was the only option which could properly address the issue of the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary."</p></blockquote>
It continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we regard this as the fundamental weakness of the current system and remedying it as the single most important consideration."</p></blockquote>
It is astonishing that, despite all the Sutherland committee's good work—the Government have accepted many of its recommendations—the Minister is choosing to ignore one of the most important considerations and fundamental weaknesses of the Scottish system. His explanation did not address that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
point. I hope that he will discuss the matter again because it is not clear why the Government chose to refuse to accept the recommendation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition members of the Committee cannot have it both ways. We heard an impassioned plea from the hon. Member for Dundee, East, who identified the individuals who terrorise witnesses and who attempt, at all costs, to avoid going to court. When they do so, their colleagues outside ensure by intimidation that the case collapses. The individuals who the hon. Gentleman mentioned should be brought to justice. The law at present closes its eyes to the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I have anything to add. The Secretary of State made our position 'clear in a recent debate in the Scottish Grand Committee. We believe that the recommendation to create another quango raises the unacceptable risk of intimidation of witnesses and victims after a trial, and it would undermine the finality of the trial process. That remains my position and I cannot therefore accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee's progress this morning, and I have no particular axe to grind, but the Minister must respond in a more reasonable way—if I may use that expression—to the point that was made by the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland appointed the Sutherland committee and defined its remit. Why have the Government decided to ignore its recommendations? They should explain why an indpendent review body is not needed to decide whether a case should be referred to appeal. I do not see why a politician rather than a qualified independent review body—which is above political considerations and which is outwith all kinds of political interference—should decide which cases should be referred to appeal. We are discussing justice and people's lives rather than politics. If the Secretary of State sets up a committee, he should listen to its recommendations and, in particular, to the recommendation to which it attaches most importance. If the Minister cannot explain why the Government chose not to listen to the committee, he should consider what his role is as a Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to rise to my feet again, but I must press the Minister on this matter. He summarised his view by saying that he refused to introduce what he called a new quango because it would involve the further intimidation of witnesses on a re-appeal. Why does he think that if the Secretary of State's takes that decision that somehow
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
avoids the problem of intimidation? The decision would be taken away from a politician and given to an independent review body, which he suggested that the level of intimidation would be greater when the indpendent body rather than the Secretary took the decision. Is the Minister seriously suggesting that any Secretary of State is somehow more capable of working or assessing the matter than the indpendent body?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call you, Lord James, it might be appropriate to say that I am allowing the debate to range more widely than the amendments. We are literally having the clause stand part debate, and I do not intend to allow such a debate later.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With cases before the High Court, there is a right of appeal for the accused after conviction—if he convicted—either on a point of law or against the facts relating to the sentence.

Normally, cases that are finished and disposed of by Scottish courts are not re-opened unless there are compelling reasons so to do. If there are reasonable grounds, as specified in the clause, the Secretary of State would refer the case. For the reasons that I have given, we do not believe that setting up a quango would be in the public interest. If the hon. Members for Dumbarton and for Perth and Kinross wish to pursue the matter, they will have to put the amendment to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mrs. Winterton, in the light of your comments about broadening our debate, I should like to make a few remarks on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the Sutherland committee was tightly argued. It examined the strengths of Scots law irrespective of what happened in England and Wales. Essentially, the committee examined the idea of an independent appeals body, not because it wanted another quango but because there is an issue of citizenship relating to the jurisdiction in which individuals live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Citizens in England and Wales have such a body under the 1995 legislation, but those in Scotland do not and, therefore, there is little equality in the law for individuals living in Scotland. On the issue of miscarriage of justice, we have cases that are currently outstanding. The hon. Member for Ayr made a point about appeals in miscarriage of justice. I am not interested in the individual merits of whether or not a person is innocent. That is for the court and the appeal to decide. However, the need for a body independent of the Executive is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The body in England and Wales was set up because of miscarriages of justice in those countries. It is a fallacy to say that we do not have that problem in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
Scotland. As my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East has said, since 1928 only 16 cases have been heard. There are individual cases currently outstanding, the merits of which I make no comment about—such as those of Pady Meehan, Joseph Steele and Thomas Campbell. Joseph Steele escaped from prison and glued himself to Buckingham Palace in his quest for an appeal. I make no comment on his innocence or otherwise, but the need for an appeal body is urgent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Sutherland committee closely examined that issue. The debate is not between Scots and English law—and it is taking place at the highest levels of the judiciary. That is why Lord Hope made his judgment in the case of Church. He interpreted section 228(2) in a libertal way, but his judgement was knocked down by the Appeal Court, which decided to interpret that provision more restrictively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister know, the Sutherland committee considered a series of options. First, it considered improving the existing system—which the Minister has partially taken on in clause 14, and we welcome that. Secondly, it considered the introduction of an independent element to the existing system. However, the Committee considered the basic weakness of that approach would be the potential for conflict between the Executive and the judiciary. Thirdly, the committee considered creating an investigative arm at the Appeal Court—an option that it rejected. Fourthly, it considered an independent review body with powers to advise on referrals of cases, an option that it also rejected. Finally, It considered the option of an independent review body with powers to refer cases direct to the Appeal Court. That would involve not the independent body taking an executive decision itself, but it taking the decision of whether to refer the case to the Appeal Court. That seems eminently sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The committee reached that decision only after a thorough examination of the options. That final option is, I think, sensible whoever is Secretary of State because it removes the politician from the process. The Committee advised that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The final option…was to remove the Secretary of State from the process altogether and to establish a new body, completely independent of the executive, with powers to consider alleged miscarriage of justice cases and to refer deserving cases to the Appeal Court for determination."</p></blockquote>
That was its recommendation and, indeed, it referred to a situation in England and Wales where the royal commission on criminal justice led to the Criminal Appeal Act 1995. It felt that an independent body in Scotland would be the most robust option and the one most likely to command public confidence. The issue should be seen as one of public confidence in the law in Scotland. Indeed, in an article a few years ago, Lord Ross, Lord Justice-Clerk of Scotland, considered the issue of public confidence and miscarriages of justice. As the second most senior person in the law in Scotland, his remarks must be taken very seriously.
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
His article asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Should the Court ever disturb a jury's assessment of credibility and reliability?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>There are obvious difficulties in this field, particularly where no questions of fresh evidence arises, and it would only be in very exceptional circumstances that a conviction could be quashed on this ground, but it is arguable that the Court ought to be prepared to remedy miscarriage of justice if such exceptional circumstances are made out."</p></blockquote>
In addition, he asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Should the Court be reluctant to exercise its power to allow an appeal on the ground of additional evidence?"</p></blockquote>
Lord Hope was concerned with the same question in the case of Church. Lord Ross unequivocally states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"particularly in cases when an appellant is not professionally represented, it would be of great advantage to the Court if it could in the appropriate case refere the case to some independent body who could carry out some investigations with a view to determining whether there appeared to be any merit in the application to allow new evidence to be led."</p></blockquote>
On allegations of perjury by Crown witnesses or allegations that expert evidence is unreliable, Lord Ross says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Apart from gery clear cases, it is extremely difficult for the Appeal Court to arrive at a proper conclusion where allegations of perjury or unreliability of witnesses are put forward. Questions of reliability and credibility are questions for the jury, and the Court should not usurp the jury's function. It is sometimes said that the Court could avoid having to usurp the function of the jury if the Court were more ready to allow a new prosecution to be brought, but, under our procedure, before the Court can grant authority to the Crown to bring a fresh prosection, the conviction must be set aside, and the court is not entitled to set aside the conviction unless it is satisfied that there has been a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly if the alleged miscarriage of justice is on the basis of the existence and significance of new evidence, the Court must evaluate the evidence and assess its affect on the jury before it can determine whether there has been a miscarriage of justice on that ground."</p></blockquote>
Finaly, Lord Ross considered the question of a new body to investigate miscarriages of justice. He says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a new body if brought into being would have an important part to ply in remedying miscarriages of justice in the criminal justice system."</p></blockquote>
He is referring specifically and exclusively to Scotland. He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed unless such a body is created, there will be some cases where one cannot be confident that means exist within the criminal justice system as presently constituted for remedying miscarriages of justice which my have occurred."</p></blockquote>
If the second most important judge in the land tells us that the law in Scotland is inadequate, I am prepared to believe him. Lord Ross recommends that certain mechanisms should be set up within the law; he does not make value judgements about particular cases. Whether it is the right hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) or perhaps, in six months' time, the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) or whoever, sitting in St. Andrews' house as Secretary of State for Scotland, I do not want any politician involved in the process. In England and Wales, we have eliminated that aspect from the issue of citizenship and human

rights, and we should be doing the same in Scotland. Scots law is deficient because of the abrogation of duty by the Secretary of State. I want that to be eliminated and I want the Minister to address that fundamental point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Dumbarton has put a good case and argued it well, as hon. Members of the Committee repeatedly do on such issues. He is arguing in favour of establishing yet another quango but, at the same time, the hon. Gentleman will say outside the House that the Government have set up far too many quangos and far too many independent bodies with no electoral responsibility to look after the nation's affairs. By sticking to his guns, my right hon. Friend the Minister will ensure that there is electoral responsibility—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On another matter, I listened carefully to the Opposition's arguments. On this occasion, they are saying that Scots law should equate with the law in England and Wales. Our debate arose when the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross suggested that there was no reason why Scots law and English and Welsh law should be tied together on every occasion. Here the circumstances suit and we should equate Scots law with that of England and Wales. Let us be fair and honest. We should ask whether we want to equate all issues or only some. The argument from Opposition Members seems confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to follow the hon. Member for Ayr because he makes me so wild. I have to control myself and remain calm. For the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Bill is to introduce automatic sentences, mandatory sentences and minimum sentences because of a rising tide of violent crime in England and Wales. That has nothing to do with Scotland. The purpose of the Bill is to introduce an English measure into Scottish law—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister says that that is nonsense, but the figures produced by the Home Secretary show that between 1987 and 1994 there was a 57 per cent. increase in violent crime in England and Wales. What was the comparative increase in Scotland during the same period? It was less than 9 per cent. In Scotland the increase was less than one sixth of that in England and
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
Wales. The Home Secretary introduced a Bill containing tough sentencing measures for England and Wales which the Opposition support. But the Government then introduced almost the same Bill for Scotland and the Minister stands up as the defender of Scots law against English and Welsh imports. It is absolute nonsense and the Minister should accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper refers to an indpendent review body making recommendations for appeal instead of the Secretary of State. It contains the basis of the argument, which was presumably made by the Secretary of State rather than the Minister of State, and gives three basic reasons. It states that the Government was not persuaded by the Sutherland committee. The Government appointed that committee, chose the people to serve on it, provided its remit, read its recommendations and then stated that those recommendations were not persuasive and that no case had been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose the hon. Gentleman has given deep thought to the fact that it costs nothing for a Member of Parliament to refer something to the Secretary of State, which is the normal practice and procedure when such problems arise. Having done that successfully a number of times, I recommend that the hon. Gentleman bears that in mind because the other process will cost money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, it is difficult to follow the hon. Gentleman because I can never understand what he says. I cannot understand the relevance of his comments to what I was saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's second comment on the Sutherland committee's recommendations was that the evidence to the committee was divided. At the end of our debate, which is virtually a clause stand part debate, perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee how the evidence was divided and who supported the idea that the right of referral should remain with the Secretary of State—a politician—rather than be given to an independent review body. Instead of making general claims in White Papers, the Government should be more specific and tell Members of Parliament what they mean by evidence being divided. It may be that the only evidence in support of the powers remaining with the Secretary of State came from the Secretary of State. we do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper also states that there has been no demonstration of overwhelming pressure for change in Scotland. Of course there has not. We are dealing with fairly specialised legal proceedings which affect only a small minority of the population of Scotland. Most people in Scotland do not worry about the appeal procedures of the court system. They have far more relevant, day-by-day worries following 17 years of Tory Government. The Government must make a case for the right of referral remaing with a politician.

When I see the Home Secretary trying to act tough

	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
in the fact of a rising tide of violent crime in England and Wales, I know that when he considers individual cases he does not consider the merits of the case but how he will be portrayed in the media and whether his tough image will be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what it is about and that is what the justices in Scotland recognise. They do not want a Home Secretary in Scotland like the present one in England and Wales, playing politics with the justice system. They want people to decide on individual cases, on their own merits. That does not happen in England and Wales, although something is being done about it. It is time that we did something about it in Scotland as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak in this debate, but I feel that we are addressing the fundamentals of what this Parliament is about and what we do in this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member of Dundee, East made sneering aside at my intervention, but we should study carefully any attempt to change the system by creating another body that would require representation and where the lawyers would make money. Secondly, but more fundamentally, I believe that the cornerstone of our unwritten constitution is the right of Members of Parliament to ask questions and to have those questions answered. It is through that mechanism that the rights and wrongs are addressed and it is cost free—I underline that point. Therefore, everyone can take advantage of it, provided that his Member of Parliament does his work effectively, properly and well. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is one of those people who does that, as do many other Members of Parliament who represent Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a unique idea that the House of Commons should deal with appeals before the criminal justice system of Scotland by referring to Members of Parliament. The hon. Gentleman and many of his hon. Friends were the first Members of Parliament to attack my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) for taking up his constituents' cases and trying to defend people who had been wrongfully convicted. The defence of Conservative Members of Parliament was, 'Leave it to the appeals system. Members of Parliament should not interfere in such processes." Now the hon. member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) is taking the opposite position, after condemning my hon. Friend for his actions in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my position because many years in the House have taught me how effective and inexpensive our system is and how well it works. Because of my practical experience of using the existing route to the benefit of my constituents I believe that it would be unwise for the Committee and the House to set up an unnecessary body. When
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
Members of Parliament do their job properly, wrongs are addressed. I have every confidence that, if the Secretary of State, regardless of his political colour—this is an important point because the hon. Gentleman always seems to cloud his views with a political colour—is approached though the proper systems by a Member of Parliament with hard evidence, he will always listen. That is why the Committee should reject opposition overtures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: the fundamental point in the debate is a constitional one: it is a matter of the separation of powers between the Executive and the judiciary. The role or otherwise of elected Members of Parliament—be they the Secretary of State of A.N.Other Back Bencher—should be irrelivant to a fundamentally legal decision. It is a legal decision as to whether to send a case back to the Appeal Court. If hon. Members agree with the fact that a legal decision is being made, why is it being made by a member, not of the judiciary, but of the Executive? That mixing up of the powers should be sorted out. Politicians should not be trusted to administer the law; that is not what they are there for. Politicians will always have in mind the effect of decisions on the press, on their own electoral circumstances and on issues that a judge or judges can put aside. To ask myriad politicians to intervene in what is, effectively, a judicial decision is an unreasonable requirement of them, no matter what their role. The hon. Member for North Tayside turns his mouth into a "no", but that is what we are discussing: a decision about whether a case that has been through the appeal procedure ought to be reexamined. That ought not to be a political decision. The law in England and Wales got into cush a mess on that issue precisely because it was perceived as a political decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should remind herself that the Secretary of State regularly acts in a quasi-judicial capacity as part of his job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, but in this case, it is a part of his job that needs to be excised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point that I was making before the hon. Member for North Tayside intervened, in England and Wales it became clear that there was a feeling that political decisions were being made on essentially legal matters, which should not have been within the providnce of the politician. We should consider whether it is possible for that to happen in Scotland too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East is quite right: the matter does not affect 90, 95, 98 or even 99 per cent. of the population; it affects a small number of people, but it is important that those people whom it affects, their legal representatives, their families and the media feel absoultely confident that the decision is not being made for political reasons. The problem is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
the developing perception that politics is entering our judicial system. That is a great shame and needs to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its consideration of the issue, the Sutherland committee made it quite clear what it felt. As has already been mentioned by a number of hon. Members, the Sutherland committee was appointed by the Government. As I understand it, its membership was made up of academics, legal practitioners, judges, a fiscal, a chief constable of police and a representative from Victim Support. The committee made a recommendation that we believe should have been accepted by the Government for good reasons: to avoid politics beginning to enter the judcicial system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady mentioned the Sutherland committee, which was chaired by the principal and vice-chancellor of Edinburgh university. It also contained Derek Emslie, Gerald H. Gordon, J. Ross Harper, Neil MacCormick, Andrew Normand, Alison Patterson, Lord Ross and Sir Leslie Sharp. The committee was not party-political in any way. It considered the matters from across a wide spectrum of the legal profession, the police and other services and gave its point of view. J. Ross Harper is admired by Conservative Members—and by some Opposition Members, although he is a Conservative—for his comments. He sat on the committee and examined the issues in an objective an dispassionate manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise names in that list from across the Scottish political spectrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to my original point, we are now discussing a constitutional issue about the importance of the separation of powers, a developing perception that the separation has been blurred—especially in England and Wales—and the idea that we have a chance not to let that happen in Scotland. The fear is that it might happen, but if the Sutherland committee's recommendations are accepted, the possibility will be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend that the Minsiter listen carefully to what is being said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can sum up quite briefly. The Sutherland committee report states on page 27 that there was
	<br><blockquote><p>"a strong body of opinion that there was no need for change to the current arrangements in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
It went on to make the point made by the hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The involvement of Ministers in the process ensured full accountability through the Parliamentary process."</p></blockquote>
More importantly, the report states on page 31 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"We felt that it was by no means self-evident that Scotland, with its different legal system and different and well-established traditions of investigations, prosecution and corroboration, needed an
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
independent executive body."</p></blockquote>
The recommendation was not especially strong—I must stress that point.

It was slightly ironic that the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross shoudl argue so strongly that we should follow the English example in terms of the Royal Commission, which started from the premise that widely publicised miscarriages of justice in England had created the need to restore public confidence in the English criminal justice system. It said that there was no evidence of widespread lack of confidence in the Scottish system works well and that we should concentrate on improving it rather than on introduccing new procedures. I made it clear tha a section in the Scottish Office has been set up to deal exclusively with miscarriages of justice petitions. Its performance is closely monitored, and there will be greater openness and disclosure when responding to petitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross discussed the separtion of powers. The Secretary of State's role is solely to review cases when all court-based remedies have been exhausted and to refer deserving cases. He does not act in a judicial capacity or determine cases. The final decision in all cases rests with the courts. The Secretary of State simply has to decide whether a court should review a previous decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the Secretary of State.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly possible for a Secretary of State who feels that he has a specific interest to refer the matter to another Minister. That has been done previously, and—[	<i>Interruption</i>] The hon. Member for Dumbarton must be clear about the matter. He asked about what would happen if the Secretary of State had a personal relationship with a constituent such that he could not objectively consider a case. The machinery exists to arrange for another Minsiter to deal with the case. That is perfectly proper—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see no reason why the Secretary of State should not consider a case where one of his constituents to be involved. If he had a personal interest it might, however, be appropriate to pass the matter on to another Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside was right to stress the importance of political accountability. We believe that, on referral, an independent review body would not provide the same accountability as that provided by the Secretary of State for Scotland. I commend the clause to the Committee and I ask my hon. Friends to resist the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was selective in his comments and in his citation of the English example. He was also selective about the Sutherland committee's report. I must remind him of what that committee said about the matter. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The aim must be to establish an appeals system which can identify and remedy genuine miscarriages of justice without being overwhelmed by frivolous and unmeritorious cases."</p></blockquote>
Opposition Members say, "Hear, hear," to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the options available to an independent body with powers, the Minister quoted from page 31 of the committee's report. However, he did not refer to paragraph 5.51, which states that the indpendent body is
	<br><blockquote><p>"the model recommended by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, legislated for in the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 and being established south of the border. Some of the representations we received reflected the view that if England and Wales had an indpendent executive body then Scotland should have no less. This, however, was neither our starting point nor the justification for our decision. Indeed we felt that it was by no means self-evident that Scotland, with its different legal system and different and well-established traditions of investigation, prosecution and corroboration, needed an independent executive body. We reached the conclusion that an independent executive body was the best solution by a process of considering and rejecting the other options. Whilst they could incorporate features such as fairness, thoroughness, speed, transparency and comprehensibility, this, we decided, was the most robust option and the one most likely to command public confidence."</p></blockquote>
The Sutherland committee was asked to consider a Scottish solution to Scottish deficiencies. It did not consider the position in England and Wales, but concentrated exclusively on Scotland. Professor Harper, a declared Conservative, and others believe that the Secretary of State should not be in the middle of the process. Irrespective of who the Secretary of State might be, that is a fine principle that must be adhered to. The Minister should not mislead us in wanting to import English law to Scotland. We are concerned solely with Scots law and want to improve it. If the Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Ross—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Secretary of State's argument about full accountability through the parliamentary process, if we are dealing with a separate Scottish legal system, should not that be accountable only to Scottish Members of Parliament? Would not it be a good ideal
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
for the Minister to consider making the Secretary of State accountable to the Scottish Grand Committee rather than to Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You ruled that my earlier point of order was rather spurious, Mrs. Winterton and I think that that my hon. Friend's comment might fit into the same category, so I shall not continue that line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a Scottish solution to a Scottish problem. There is a defect in the system, which the Lord Justice-Clerk and others have considered. The Government have manifestly failed to do so and have been so inadequate that the Minister now says that the Secretary of State can deal with a constituents problems and then change his mind nine of 10 minutes later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ten seconds later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but we are discussing not relatives but constituents and the decision will be political—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Whatever the hon. Member for North Tayside may say, can he tell us how many of the cases which he has referred to the Secretary of State have been successful? The process is political with a politician sitting in the middle, where he should not be. Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may come as a great surprise to the hon.

Part of that responsibility is their accountability to Parliament if they hold an executive position in the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should study a little more carefully how Parliament works and what we do. He would then understand why the Secretary of State, refers matters that affect him as a constituency Member of Parliament—whether planning, law or anything else—to another Minister. That happens all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that politicians make the law. Don't we know it. The Government have been making bad law not only for the 10 years that I have been here, but for the past 17 years. The point is that politicians do not implement the law. We do not want them to implement the law or to be in the middle of the process. That is the thrust of the Opposition's argument.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to the amendments in my name. Amendment No. 141 would ensure that there is some latitude from the time limit on applications to transfer a deceased persons rights of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides that an application for transfer of a deceased person's right to institute or continue an appeal must be made within three months of the death. Compliance with that time limit might not always be possible. In circumstances where a presentative could not go to court for reasons of sickness, the amendment would introduce a dispensing power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 137 would ensure that notification of an application of transfer of a deceased persons right to appeal is made widely. The Bill would allow an executor or any person with a legitimate interest to institute or continue an appeal on behalf of a deceased person. It could be argued that a notification process is necessary not least to minimise the risk of multiple appeals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see exactly what the hon. Lady aims to do with amendment No. 141, which would allow a person to apply at any time to the High Court for authorisation to institute or continue an appeal in respect of a deceased person if cause can be shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the amendment would put the person applying for authorisation in a much more advantageous position than the convicted person himself would have been in if he had not died. Section 109 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 provides that, where a person convicted on indictment wishes to appeal against conviction or sentence, he must lodge intimation of his intention to appeal within two weeks of the final determination of the proceedings. Our intention behind clause 17 is to put the person applying for, or who is granted, authorisation to institute or continue an appeal in a similar position as the dead person himself would have been in immediately prior to his death. It is accepted, however, that in the upheaval caused by a death it would be appropriate for a somewhat longer period to
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
be allowed for an application to be made to institute or continue an appeal. We believe that three months should give sufficient time in the few cases in which this provision can be expected to apply. It is important that there should be finality in proceedings at some stage and we see no justification in the circumstances covered by the clause in allowing an open-ended right to appeal, even where cause has been shown. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross not to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister, for clarification purposes, address himself to amendment No. 137, which deals with a slightly different point—that of newspaper notification?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That amendment would require the High Court to notify that an application had been made on behalf of a deceased person by publishing this information in a newspaper circulating in the area where the deceased had lived, and only after 14 days had passed shall it make an order authorising the applicant to institute or continue any appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that the purpose behind this proposal is to allow a person, other than the party applying for authorisation, to object to the application on the grounds that he or she has a greater interest than the applicant in instituting or continuing the appeal. I cannot envisage this occurring in practice, however, and am reluctant to agree to the introduction of a requirement that would merely delay matters. The amendment would not have any real practical effect. It does not allow for an objection to the application to be made and it does not alter the requirement for the court to make an order if the applicant is either an exectutor or otherwise appears to the court to have a legitimate interest. I therefore ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In clause 18, new section 60A(a) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to him that the order or direction was inappropriate".</p></blockquote>
That it is different from section 60A(b), which refers to a problem on a point of law. There is a danger of the prosecution using it as a way of being tough on the criminal. If the criminal is put under a hospital order, it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
may be felt that that is somehow less than an immediate custodial sentence. This is an on-going debate in the public domain and has been discussed on several occasions in this Committee, when we discussed specific clauses dealing with mentally-disordered criminals. Somehow people feel that treating people as mentally ill or mentally disorded is a softer option than sending them to prison. Many of us believe—I certainly continue to believe—that people who commit criminal acts, particularly repeated violent or sexually-motivated attacks, are mentally ill and require to be treated as such. They are mentally disordered in many, rather than a few, cases. In this Committee, we have already heard that only about 12 such cases in which people are considered to be mentally disorded are likely to occur in any year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not amend the clause, the prosecution may decide that it wants to have a second bite, by appealling not only on the leniency of the sentencing, which is becoming more and more common in England, Wales and Scotland recently, but on what it interprets as the softer option of the hospital order combined with a period of internment. The problem in Scottish law is that people are pressing the procurator to appeal against a hospital order, and public opinion has a strong effect on such things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would require a hospital order to be made after the evidence of two medical practitioners, either in writing or in court. Also, the Bill would require the judge to decide whether a hospital order would be an appropriate action. One could then have procurators fiscal wanting to be tough and wanting to be seen by the public to be tough. They may be responding to public outcry and to what they feel is political or media pressure, which can be particularly strong. They may appeal against a hospital order because they think that it is inappropriate and get into an area where it is a question not of law, but of their opinion. That is dangerous. We are suggesting to the Minister that it should be appropriate to remove the following words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if it appears to him that the order or direction was inappropriate".</p></blockquote>
That seems a simple matter. It is too wide a scope and invites an involvement other than the medical evidence and the judge's judgment. It offers a chance to bring public opinion and public pressure into these matters in a way that would be wholly inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members want to protect the public as much as anyone else; we have had a long debate in previous sittings about the appropriateness of giving hospital orders and combining them with a custodial sentence. The Minister has argued his case. To leave in the right of a procurator fiscal or prosecutor to demand the setting aside of that hospital order on such wide grounds is likely to cause trouble in future. The Minister should stick to the point of law and he would understand that if a point of law was made by the prosecutor, it would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
an appropriate way of disposing of the criminal. It would be wrong to have the kind of public debate that would follow if we had the procurator debating in public the inappropriateness of a hospital order. I hope that the Minister will take that matter on board and remove the relevant words from the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now well established that the Crown has a right to appeal against sentences imposed by the courts which are perceived to be unduly lenient or, to put it another way, inappropriately lenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders which are the subject of clause 18 are orders which a criminal court can impose in cases where the convicted person's mental condition warrants admission to hospital or the making of a guardianship order. In all cases following conviction, it is appropriate to provide a Crown right of appeal against the imposition of an inappropriate disposal. In respect of a mental health disposal, the appeal ought not to be on the ground of leniency, but must be on the ground of inappropriateness. For instance, the Lord Advocate may take the view that the imposition by a court of a hospital order was inappropriate because, in his view, the evidence as to the offence in question, the offender's antecedents and the risk of his committing further offences if set at large, would warrant the making of a restriction order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Restriction on discharge are covered by clause 59 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. A hospital order is made where the court has regard to the nature of the offence, the antecedents and the risk of the mental disorder being such that the offender might commit further offences if set at large. Essentially, the measure provides a protection for the community and should be seen in that light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that the Minister has not argued a very good case. He has provided a very good case. He has provided a very weak justification for the word "appropriate" if the procurator fiscal decides that a disposal is not appropriate. After hearing the evidence of two psychiatric medical experts and a judge's assessment that it was an appropriate disposal to provide someone with a period of treatment, how could a prosecutor possibly argue that it was not appropriate? Are the Government giving the prosecutor the right to call into question the medical capability and competence of those who gave evidence? That appears to be what is being said-that a legal professional with the right to appeal under new section 60A(b) is then given the right to appeal against the medical expertise of two psychiatric medical officers. That seems wholly inappropriate; it is asking for a conflict that will have more to do with publicity and taking a tougher or softer or more lenient stance in the courts—it will be a public opinion debate—than with the appropriateness of the sentence of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
disposal. That sentence will not be an alternative to prison, but a period of treatment in a psychiatric hospital or similar institution, followed by a period of incarceration in a prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Guardianship or restriction orders are similarly subject to t he evidence of experts. If prosecutors do not like the evidence because it does not suit their wish to have a person slammed up without treatment, I hope that the Government will not give them the right to argue against the experts' evidence. The Government made a strong argument about how to deal with mentally disordered criminals and they should stick with it. They argued strongly that the medical experts, plus the judge, would decide what was appropriate. We agreed reluctantly and did not press our amendments on that issue. Now, the Government will give the right to argue to someone who is only legally trained and probably has a different axe to grind - someone who wants a conviction rate and a specific sentencing regime, which is not appropriate in the case of such orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite sure about the relevance of the medical opinion of psychiatrists other than those who are called to the trial. The procurator fiscal might say, "I do not like what those psychiatrists said; I am going to call another couple of psychiatrists who will back my case that this person does not require a period of treatment". That seems to be asking for conflicts that we do not need. Therefore I ask the Secretary of State seriously to consider withdrawing that part of the Bill and to leave the legal experts to argue points of law and the medical experts to argue points of medical treatment for psychiatric and mentally disturbed patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members appreciate the sort of circumstances that could conceivably arise. For example; the court might not accept the medical evidence in favour of a restriction order. In other words, the Lord Advocate's appeal might be designed to achieve what the doctors, although not the court, thought was necessary. The effect of a restriction order is to place the offender under various restrictions—for example, on discharge—in order to protect the communit, and those are set out in the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984.

The Crown already has certain rights of appeal against mental health disposals involving insanity under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Those rights of appeal, against orders that have the same effect as hospital, restriction or guardianship orders, are appeals only on points of law. The making of those orders does not follow a conviction, only a finding at an examination of facts or an acquittal on grounds of insanity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is principally designed to protect the community. The Crown may argue that the court was wrong in making a hospital order without a restriction order because it is perfectly possible to draw a distinction between the two and to make one without the other. The purpose of a restriction order is to protect the public when the patient is discharged into the community. That is the purpose of the clause, and it is a relatively minor point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is what the Minister is trying to achieve, I suggest that he needs to redraft the clause. He is saying that, if an order is not made or if an order is inadequate, the power to ask for an additional order is required. But the clause does not say that. The clause does not say that if the hospital direction is not accompanied by an appropriate restriction order, the prosecutor can appeal against it. The clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a hospital order…has been made".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, that will be interpreted to their advantage by people who wish to challenge the use of hospital orders as part of the sentencing of anyone considered by medical experts and a judge to be mentally disordered, and by anyone who thinks that an offender should be taken away and put in gaol, although the medical experts and the judge have decided that that is not a wholly appropriate sentence and that psychiatric treatment is necessary.

	<br><blockquote><p>'(f) In any case where it is competent for a convicted person or a prosecutor to appeal against a decision under section 49 of the 1995 Act to remit a case to the Principal Reporter the court shall consider whether a curator ad litem should be appointed to safeguard the interests of the child concerned and if so minded shall make such appointment'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would require courts to consider whether a curator ad litem should be appointed to safeguard the interests of any child who may be involved in proceedings under section 49 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. The need arises because of the situation in Scotland—Scottish children are not subject to the same system of juvenile justice as that in other parts of the United Kingdom. Most of us are aware that the children's panel is unique and receives universal high regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ethos of the 1995 Act is to create a child-centred system in Scots family law. It is appropriate for the criminal law to reflect that child-centredness. The amendment merely seeks to ensure that all children who are dealt with by the courts are properly protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising the subject of the welfare of children in the court system, which is of great interest to the Government. We have shown in the past that we are willing to take steps wherever possible to improve procedures and give sympathetic consideration to proposals. However, I am not convinced that there is a need for the amendment. Indeed, I am at a loss to know why a curator ad litem should have to be appointed at such a late stage in the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interests of any child who is involved in criminal proceedings should be covered by the child receiving appropriate advice and support from his or her guardians and legal representatives. Against that background, I do not see why special provision needs to be inserted to allow for the appointment of a curator
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
ad litem once the child has been convicted. As the hon. Lady is aware, a curator ad litem is principally appointed in civil proceedings. There has not been a perceived need to date for such appointments in criminal procedure.

The amendment is necessary because the courts should deal with a case only if a probation order that is served on a person for breach of notice includes all the relevant information. I draw the Minister's attention to the provisions of clause 4, which relates to electronic tagging. Proposed new section 245F(3), which is on page 9 of the Bill, states that a breach of a tagging or curfew order is not admissible in evidence unless the offender has been served with the appropriate information. We believe that for consistency the same should apply in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the Hon. Members with interest since it was not entirely clear from the terms of the amendment what they were seeking to achieve. If a probationer commits an offence while on probation, he must be convicted of that offence before action can be taken under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. At that stage, under subsection 233(1), the court will issue a warrant for the arrest of the probationer or a citation for him to appear at court. When the offender then appears, he will have the opportunity to challenge the proposition that he has been convicted of an offence while on probation and, indeed, to put the prosecutor to proof on that issue.
