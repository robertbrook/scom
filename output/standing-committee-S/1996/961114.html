	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I seek your guidance. The Bill's approach is so misconceived that I want to table a new clause. The Government should treat people who commit multiple or serial crimes as being mentally ill. Is it in order to table a new clause to that effect? Could that new clause be debated or would the fact that it could be regarded as negating the Bill—it would require the Government to consider using mental institutions, rather than criminal incarceration for some offenders—mean that it would not be in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is absolutely no problem with that. If a member of the Committee wants to table an amendment or a new clause he should present it in the usual fashion. Obviously, I should have to examine the contents of the new clause before ruling on it. The best course of action that I can suggest is for the hon. Gentleman to table a new clause—we can take the matter from there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Would that new clause be debated after the relevant amendment or would they be grouped together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving an O-level course on how to table amendments—I am trying to run a Committee. The hon. Gentleman should take up his point of order with the Clerk after this morning's sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>IMPRISONMENT FOR LIFE ON FURTHER CONVICTION FOR CERTAIN OFFENCES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 16, leave out "18" and insert "21".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 71, in page 2, line 9, leave out
	<br><q><p>"(a) where he has attained the age of 21 years,".</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 70, in page 2, leave out lines 11 to 14.</p>
	<p>No. 21, in clause 2, page 4, leave out lines 11 to 18.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall commence with the crucial matter of automatic sentences, which is contained in clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
Before I discuss that subject, however, I should point out that amendment No. 1 would remove the reference to 18-year-olds and replace it with a reference to 21-year-olds, and that amendment No. 70 would leave out lines 11 to 14 on page 2, which state that the High Court will sentence the person
	<br><q><p>"where he has attained the age of 18 years but is under the age of 21 years, to be detained for life, and a person so sentenced shall be liable to be detained in a young offenders institution."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman. Amendment No. 1 has been moved and amendments Nos. 71, 70 and 21 are grouped with it and can also be debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 71, 70 and 21 are related to the subject that is raised in amendment No. 1—mandatory life sentences for those who are over 21 and who commit certain repeat offences. Repeat offenders under the age of 21 should not be subjected to mandatory life imprisonment—the courts should have the discretion in such cases and pay regard to the youth of the offender. Amendment No. 70 would remove from the Bill the proposal that an offender should be
	<br><q><p>"detained for life, and a person so sentenced shall be liable to be detained in a young offenders institution."</p></q>
What does "life" mean in that context, especially in relation to a person who is aged between 18 and 21 and who is sentenced to life imprisonment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an important legal distinction between the ages of 18 and 21. Those who are found guilty of a relevant offence would, as far as we are aware, be spending part of their time in a young offenders' institution from the age of 18 to 21. We need to distinguish between those ages-21 is a cut-off point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no difficulty in accepting the proposition that it would be oppressive to apply the automatic life provisions to young persons who might still be immature and find it hard to deal with their offending behaviour. The difference between the Opposition and the Government concerns the minimum age at which an automatic life sentence should apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland is eight years old, the vast majority of children up to the age of 16 in Scotland who are suspected of offending are dealt with by children's hearings. Only those who commit the most serious offences—thankfully, they are few in number—are prosecuted in the criminal courts. There is, therefore, an argument for making 16 the age limit for an automatic life sentence. However, people aged up to 18 years can be subject to supervision under the children's hearings arrangements and we have therefore proposed that that should be the lower limit at which the commission of an offence should trigger an automatic life sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members might want to bear in mind that the provisions will apply only to those who have already been convicted of a qualifying offence and that if that conviction has resulted in a custodial sentence, then, more likely than not, the offender will have had to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
serve that sentence before he has the opportunity to reoffend. That will limit the possibility of reoffending by comparatively young people, which would result in an automatic lif sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To go further and limit the age at which a second or further relevant offence can be committed to 21 would disapply the provisions to those who are most frequently involved in criminal activity. The peak age for offending is between the ages of 18 and 19. many people convicted of murder are aged under 21—indeed, a significant number are aged under 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that response, but can he elaborate on what is meant by "life" in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. An automatic life sentence means that the judge will also be able to specify a minimum period which he or she believes the convicted person should serve. That sentence will be observed and release will depend on whether the person is considereed to be a threat to the community. If he is not, he will be released.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I ask the Minister for further clarification? If the judge passes a life sentence on a youngster aged 18 or 19 and specifies that he serve 12 years, does that mean that the youngster would spend 12 years in prison but that, if he complies with parole considerations—a maximum of one sixth off, which would be two years in this case—he will be out after 10 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the youngster would be out after 12 years. The minimum sentence would be followed and the prisoner would be released, provided that he had been wellbehaved and was not showing signs of being a threat to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel quite clear in my mind, but would like to clarify for the record that, in terms of a minimum sentence, discounting parole does not apply in such cases. Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not apply in such cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that with a life sentence, if a minimum of 12 years must be served, that is the minimum and any remission thereafter and any thought of release depends on the individual's behaviour in prison? On that basis, the individual has the opportunity to earn remission on a life sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinction between an automatic life sentence and a mandatory life sentence. In discussion of clauses 1 and 2, we are considering automatic life sentences. A mandatory life sentence is attracted when someone commits murder—that person could expect to stay in prison considerably longer. What weighs particularly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
with an automatic life sentence is the minimum period that is attracted to the sentence by the judge when he has heard all the circumstances of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe (Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond to the amendment. Hon. Members will then have a chance to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is entirely reasonable to expect persons aged 18 and above to be held fully responsible for reoffending involving serious violent and sexual offences and to be able to appreciate the consequences. Someone aged 18 or 19 who has shown himself capable of reoffending in this way surely presents as great a risk to the public as such a person aged 21 and the public are entitled to expect the same protection from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment No. 21, I see no benefit in an amendment that simply deletes words that are explanatory and clarificatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the Minister is taking interventions or has finished speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister finished his speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have finished now. I shall listen carefully to the hon. Gentleman and respond to him in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to intervene, but I want to make a short point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has finished, so if the hon. Gentleman wants to speak, he may do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would appear that the Bill is a con trick on the public. The Government's comments leading up to the Bill were that life would mean life. But that is not so—the Minister said that life will mean 12 years. Offenders will not necessarily remain on licence for the rest of their natural life. There is no relationship between the provision and what the Government are peddling in the press. It was helpful of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) to reveal that. The Government are trying to tell people that they will be protected from such offenders for life, but under the Bill they will be protected by a sentence which the judge may state will be only 15 or 16 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but he must speak to the amendment, which concerns the change of age from 18 to 21.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to that, and I hope to be called to make a speech later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being told that someone aged 18 will be subject to a limited sentence that will not be life; he may be released into society 12 years later at the age of 30. If he is 21 when he is convicted, he may be released 12 years later at the age of 33. Our argument is that offenders would be more mature if they came out at the age of 33. The use of mandatory life sentences and automatic life sentences should begin at 21. Let us be honest with the public. We are trying to keep people in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
institutions until, as the Minister said, they are no longer a threat to society. I believe that that should not be done in prisons because prisons have failed to put people back into society so that they are no longer a threat. They may be back out after 12 years, but the point is whether they are, as the Minister said, capable of assessing and moving away from offending behaviour. But that is more likely to happen if offenders become subject to the provision at the age of 21 instead of 18. The purpose is to protect society and I hope that I shall be called later to say more about that because the Bill does not address that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we go any further, we should be clear about the distinction between automatic and mandatory life sentences. Clause 1 does not distinguish between them so the distinction is not clear. I do not believe that there is any division among us about treating serious crimes committed by people of any age. What matters is how they are dealt with, what steps society takes to try to ensure that they do not reoffend and, if they do, that they are treated with appropriate seriousness. I want to be clear about the distinction. Is it being suggested that someone might serve a sentence of, say, 12 years and have no hope whatsoever of remission, no matter how well behaved or co-operative he were, and no matter how he tried to remedy his ways and show that he was not a threat to society? We need to know if that is what the Minister means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAnion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, to come within the remit of the clause, the person must be over 18 when he commits the second offence. But the person could be well below 18 when he commits the initial offence that is taken into consideration. I am worried about the definition of qualifying offences for the purposes of this clause. Subsection (5) on page 2 defines the qualifying offences, as a result of which a person between the ages of 18 and 21 may face an automatic or mandatory sentence. The definition includes
	<br><q><p>"a conviction for which an order is made placing the offender on probation or discharging him absolutely or conditionally".</p></q>
A person under 18 could have a conviction, but have been discharged unconditionally by the court and then face an automatic or mandatory sentence if he receives another conviction when he is over the age of 18. Will the Minister say whether that is the intention behind the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend and follow his reasoning. Does he also agree that, as the clause stands, someone as young as eight or nine—because, in Scotland, criminal responsibility starts at eight years of age—with a qualifying offence may find himself, 12 years later, at 20, facing an automatic sentence as a result of the qualifying offence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. My hon. Friend makes a fair point. The age of criminal responsibility in Scotland is eight. So a person of eight or nine might commit an offence and then, when he is 18, get involved in a fight, because fights are common. In
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
Glasgow and some other areas of Scotland, it is common for young men to get involved in fights, which sometimes end in tragedy. The young person may just be a member of a group that gets involved in a fight; he may not be directly responsible for the death of the person killed, but he may be part of a gang and therefore face an indictment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about an automatic and mandatory life sentence for someone who may have been on the fringe of a fight and, moreover, someone whose qualifying offence may have resulted in an unconditional discharge by the court. That is not good law. If that is what the Minister is proposing, he should think again, and reconsider the amendment, which is sensible. I remember being in this Committee Room when the same Minister was arguing that people under 25 should not be entitled to full housing benefit because they were not fit to live on their own. Now, he wants to bang them away for life because he says that they are responsible. That does not make good sense or good law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we get the issue of age absolutely right. The Minister is creating a situation in which many people will end up facing automatic and mandatory sentences which common sense tells them they should not be facing. It should be left up to the judges to make a decision based on the circumstances of each individual case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the words of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), when my right hon. Friend responds to the debate will he say whether, if a person commits an offence when it is a child of eight and then commits another when he is 18 or 19, it is not possible for the judge to take that into account under the exceptional circumstances provision in the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On another aspect, if an 18 year old commits a serious offence, would not a typical sentence be two or two and a half years? If that individual were then seriously to reoffend, surely it would be wrong for the Bill to prevent the seriousness of the crime being taken into account?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, I should like him to take account of another argument. If, for example, in a jury trial, the jury knew that the offender, aged 18, would receive a mandatory life sentence should he be found guilty of the charge, they may choose to return a verdict on a lesser charge. Does not the Minister think that, in jury trials, it is more likely that the jury will make a decision based not just on the question of guilt but on the question of the effective sentence? We might, for example, end up with a jury finding someone guilty of a charge that is less than the charge in the list, which might be culpable homicide or attempted murder.

That has happened in the past—I cited the most extreme cases in the 18th century—and it is likely to occur in future. Juries will be aware that the judge has no right to act in a sensitive fashion when sentencing and that they must take that into account in their deliberations, although they will not actually be told to do so. That is the reality of ordinary people facing a stark choice. They will have to decide on the level of

guilt while knowing that it could carry a mandatory life sentence. That would be dangerous and I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an important point. In Scottish criminal history there is the well-known case of Madeleine Smith who, pretty obviously, was guilty of poisoning her lover, but a jury, not wanting to hang her, acquitted her. It is a great possibility that not only will a jury find someone guilty of a lesser crime, but that it might let a defendant off altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point is very well made. I am sure that the Minister has it in mind to answer the point made by my hon. Friend about the Madeleine Smith case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, in many circumstances we find that the procurators fiscal in Scotland think that they could not get a conviction or a more serious charge. I believe that plea bargaining goes on in the Scottish courts although, theoretically, it is banned. People are charged with serous assault when they should be charged with attempted murder. I can cite several cases from my constituency. When I pressed people behind the scenes to tell me why a charge was changed, they told me that, had they gone for an attempted murder charge, all the witnesses who were part of the assault would say that the person accused was not at the centre of the attack. As they wanted to get that person nailed for at least something, they had to press a serious assault charge which allowed the witnesses to say that they were all involved in the crime but that the person charged was certainly the ringleader, which resulted in the defendant getting done for serious assault. Had the charge been attempted murder, which the people behind the scenes thought it should have been, all the accused's friends would have defended him and not given true witness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It happens again and again that a lesser charge is carried by the procurator fiscal because he or she does not think it possible to get a conviction on a more serious charge. I believe that parallel situation will now be entered into statute law. If the 18-year-olds who will come before the courts in the circumstances outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East have a previous conviction from when they were very young, a jury will be asked to put them away for life even if the previous conviction does not relate to the circumstances involved in the new charge. If the Minister enters into that type of contract with the legal system, which he is about to do, we will come a cropper. More people will get off serious chages because of their age than at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of important points have been raised. I shall start with the one about children, who usually go to children's panels. The provisions would not apply unless there was a previous High Court conviction. A child would go to the High Court only under extremely serious circumstances—murder or attempted murder. We
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
believe, for example, that if there are two cases of robbery with firearms, that should be brought before the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that previous convictions cannot be brought before the court or the jury before a conviction is reached. Previous convictions can be put before the court only once a conviction has been reached by a jury and not before. A jury cannot be influenced by previous convictions. It would, in general, be quite wrong for previous convictions to be put before the court. Occasionally, however, if an accused person puts his character in issue and says that he has been a person of supreme honour, integrity and honesty throughout his life, the prosecutor can introduce his previous convictions, but those circumstances are very rare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that a jury in a murder trial, when the accused is 18-years-old, will not know when it decides on a conviction whether that person faces an automatic or mandatory sentence? The jury will be reaching a verdict in the dark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying precisely that. The jury will not know the person's previous record; all they will know is what is contained in the indictment relating to the particular circumstances of the crime with which he or she is charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton wanted to know exactly what we mean by a life sentence. In an automatic life sentence, the judge sets the relevant part of the sentence, which could be six, 10, 12 or 15 years; he sets the minimum time to be spent in custody depending on the circumstances and the gravity of the case. That minimum time is fixed unless it is successfully appealed against. Release after the relevant part of the sentence is a matter for the parole board; if, for example, it is thought that the circumstances of the crime are not of the most serious nature and the judge gives a shorter relevant period, the question of release on life licence comes up before the parole board after that period has elapsed. There is no remission on the minimum period, or relevant part, as set by the judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked if life means life. A life sentence means being under sentence for life so that, after release, the offender is on life licence and subject to recall. The key issue and purpose of clause 1—clause 2 deals with a separate subject—is to protect the public from serious offenders. The provisions would have applied in the Maguire case and would have given the public additional protection, as they will do as soon as they are enforced. The automatic life sentence will apply only where both the first and second convictions are obtained on indictment in the High Court. That rules out virtually all cases involving children, to which the hon. Member for Dundee, East referred, although if children were involved in extremely serious cases they could come before the High Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I ask my hon. Friend—with the indulgence of the Chair—to explain the difference between an automatic life sentence and a mandatory sentence, given that we have had a full explanation of an automatic life sentence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A mandatory life sentence is for murder and the offender comes before the parole board in due course; the extent to which he or she is no longer considered a threat to the community is relevant to the parole board's recommendations. A mandatory life sentence is likely to last considerably longer than most automatic life sentences, as the crime for which a mandatory sentence is imposed is the most serious that can be committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked about automatic life sentences. They will be imposed for two qualifying offences and a designated part would be fixed by the judge; that part will represent the punishment element of the sentence and the prisoner will not be released until it has been served. Thereafter the prisoner will be released only if the parole board considers that he or she will not be a risk to the public; if released, he or she will be subject to a licence and liable to be recalled into custody. The mandatory life sentence is for murder and does not include a designated part. That is the difference between the two forms of life sentence. The prisoner will be released only when the Secretary of State decides that that is appropriate, after advice from the parole board and consultation with the judiciary. Protection of the community is a vital part of that consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall return to those issues later, but I would like to ask the Minister about qualifying offences. Am I correct in thinking that it is a two-stage process? In my understanding, the first stage is a qualifying or relevant offence, which means an offence committed in England, Wales or Northern Ireland; the second stage is a qualifying offence related to the specifics of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, absolutely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Huge issues arise as a result of the amendment. The Opposition think that a distinction should be made between 18-year-olds and 21-year-olds. A year or two ago, I visited Dumfries young offenders' institution and saw many young people, almost all of whom had committed offences at 18 years of age. I asked two or three young people what they were in for, and they said, "Life". I then asked what had happened, and one of them said, "Well, I was in a pub, I had had too much to drink and somebody got killed. I couldnae
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
remember it, but my mates told me I did it." My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East has referred to such events in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was walking through Edinburgh only two weeks ago, a judge approached me and we had a chat about sentencing. He told me that he tried his best when sentencing, but that it was very hard. He said that he did not take the bleeding liberal line, but he realised that young people, especially those under 21 years of age, can be involved in one-off events the follies of their lives—and that he tried to ensure that he gave the best sentence, taking into account individual circumstances. The Bill will remove from judges that individual choice, even though they know exactly what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie), who has just departed, mentioned the issue of exceptional circumstances. Again, we shall deal with that issue later. I do not want to build up a form of case law, stating what exceptional circumstances are, and find that solicitors regularly appeal on those grounds on behalf of their clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the Opposition, the phrase "exceptional circumstances" means the use of judicial discretion. We cannot understand why such discretion is being removed. The issue of young offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 should be looked at, simply because it merits special consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The peak of offending is found in the 18 to 19 age group. The example, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, of the young person who could not remember what had happened when he killed someone does not alter the fact that the public must be protected. We want to shift the emphasis towards the victim by putting in place these additional protections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not removing judges' discretion. Judges will determine the minimum period that offenders must spend in prison, which will allow them to take into account all the circumstances of the offence. Judges will not have to impose automatic life sentences if there are exceptional circumstances. We shall debate that matter later, so I shall say only that it will be for the court to decide whether there are exceptional circumstances in each case and that we will expect the court to consider any particularly strong mitigating factors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister on the Government's refusal to accept the amendment. I am concerned about where young people serve sentences and the conditions in which they serve them. In my constituency, there has been a massive reduction in opportunities for those in Polmont young offenders' institution. For example, there used to be training for freedom units—bungalows outwith the perimeter fence—where some of the young people went to prepare themselves for their return to society, but women from Cornton Vale prison use those units now.

Has the Minister any thoughts of focusing on the rehabilitation of young people who offend, so that something good happens to them, apart from their becoming good prisoners and living well within the criminal fraternity? Has the Minister anything to say about how society will be protected? I return him to his own phrase about making sure that people leave when they are no longer a threat to society. The Scottish Council for Civil Liberties is worried about the resource implications of young people from the age of 18 up being given mandatory sentences; it is worried that resources will be taken by a slamming-up process rather than by a rehabilitation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister thought about the consequences of putting young people aged 18 on mandatory life sentence in young offenders' institutions? Knowing that they will be in the prison system for such a long period may demotivate them to go through a process of rehabilitation; they will settle down to be good criminals in a criminal environment in prison. They may become good prisoners, but they will not expect to get out in the short term and will therefore have no motivation to think about becoming better citizens when they leave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the Minister that the public must be protected; that is extremely important. We are concerned with the issue of crime and punishment, and the Opposition's contention is that the Bill will not assist the reduction of crime. We will debate exceptional circumstances later, and in the light of that fact, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall address my remarks principally to amendment No. 74, but I shall speak to the other amendments as well. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East referred to clause 1(5), which in lines 40 to 42 of page 2 mentions
	<br><q><p>"a conviction for which an order is made placing the offender on probation or discharging him absolutely or conditionally".</p></q>
We feel that qualifying offences should be those which result in a sentence or imprisonment or detention for at least three years—to demonstrate the gravity of the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By tabling amendment No. 8 we seek elaboration of the issue of "exceptional circumstances". The amendment reads:
	<br><q><p>"at end insert 'exceptional circumstances' includes the circumstances of the qualifying or relevant offence"</p></q>
—the qualifying offence being an offence in schedule 5A on page 3 and the relevant offence being an offence committed in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the Government to elaborate on the issue of exceptional circumstances. It does not suffice for them to say that it is up to the judge to decide what are exceptional circumstances if they are not well laid out in the Bill. The Government tell us that that is an issue for judicial discretion, but I wonder why judicial discretion is to be taken away in the first place. The provision for exceptional circumstances does not suffice, which is why I have moved the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the Bill that will prevent the court from taking the circumstances of qualifying and relevant convictions into consideration. We do not want to make provisions that might restrict the court's discretion to decide what are exceptional circumstances and how they should be weighed in reaching its conclusion, which the amendment would do by singling out qualifying or relevant convictions. Therefore I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand the Minister correctly? Does he mean that, even if someone committed, and was found guilty of, a relatively minor offence that merited a sentence of six months, that person could go to prison for an extremely long time for a second offence if a judge happened to be of a particularly severe nature? Would not that be entirely possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady suggests a case involving a sentence of six months. Usually that would be a sentence applied by the sheriff court. The High Court attracts more serious cases, which are deliberately marked down for that court by the advocate-deputes of the Law Officers. In most cases, the sentence would probably have to be longer before it came under the terms of the Bill. The judge is entitled to take all the circumstances into account and, if those circumstances were less serious, he would be entitled to set a shorter sentence, which he may consider to be more appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the Minister correctly, the first judge dealing with the first offence at the High Court could decide to sentence the defendant to six months. On the second occasion, a judge with a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
particularly severe attitude towards sentencing might give the defendant an extremely long sentence—perhaps an automatic life sentence—on the grounds that he had committed the earlier offence—even though a previous judge had thought that that offence was worth only six months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not in favour of enormous discrepancies in sentencing. We should prefer as much consistency in sentencing as possible. For example, if a rape case comes up in one court and the judge gives a year and in the next-door court, for a similar case, another judge gives 15 years, that would be considered totally out of place. That is why sentencing guidelines can be applied by the High Court to ensure that the sentence is appropriate for the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady is concerned about a crime that is not considered especially serious—one that attracks a six-month sentence. Later on, the decision of the court that is entitled to determine the minimum period—the qualifying part laid down by the judge—will depend on the circumstances of the case. The judge would be entitled to take into account the fact that the first crime had attracted a less severe sentence after all the circumstances of the case had been heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he did not want to define the term "exceptional circumstances" because to do so would be to limit the judges' discretion when making up their minds about the sort of sentence that should be imposed. The clause, however, limits the judges' discretion by making it mandatory to bring in an automatic life sentence in that category of offences. That does not stand up to scrutiny. The Minister is contradicting himself. In reality, is it not the case that judges will use the phrase "exceptional circumstances" to maintain the status quo? They will decide what kind of sentence should be applied as they do at the moment—even though they are doing it under the banner of automatic life sentences. It appears that the Government are introducing automatic life sentences but, in reality, that will not happen. The judges will use that phrase "exceptional circumstances" to continue to do what they do at the moment. We are wasting our time with the clause because the Government are playing a political game to look tough before the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The judges are as much bound by the law as the rest of us. The judges must enforce what is in statute, which is a matter for Parliament. They have to follow the laws that Parliament lays down. The judges will certainly have a discretion: that is right because, in order to protect the community, they need to take account of all the circumstances of a specific crime when setting the qualifying period within which the offender should not be released from prison. At that point, the parole board takes properly into account the extent to which the offender is a threat to a community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does he envisage that judges will detail what the exceptional circumstances are in their summing up so that they are a matter of record for the court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to limit judges' discretion on exceptional circumstances. I said earlier that I would expect the judge and the court to take into account mitigating circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question we seem to have been led to by the Minister is whether discretion exists. The Minister does not want to provide any guidelines although we heard during the Committee stage of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Bill that the Government would set down orders in court. Is the Minister saying, as was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East, that we are putting a false prospectus before the public—that the measure is mere posturing before the election and that court procedures and advice to judges on when to use their discretion will not be given? Is this just a posture for the statute book or, unbeknownst to the Minister, is the Secretary of State working on a set of guidelines for Ministers? Either the Government are leaving discretion with judges, or they will tell them what they expect them to do. The Minister appears to be saying that the Government will not suggest to judges the limit of their discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to add to the comments of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), perhaps my right hon. Friend the Minister could provide a little further guidance. Is not there clear direction in the Bill that the exceptional circumstances would be open to appeal by the Lord Advocate where it was thought that the judges had gone beyond their discretion in being lenient with a specific sentence? Given the Government's wise decision to give the Lord Advocate powers of appeal, they have provided for the discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a separate, detailed question, can I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister about the definition of "exceptional circumstances"? Can they apply to the prior qualifying offence or just to the offence under consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If, to take an extreme example, a person committed an offence at the age of 18 and attracted a six-month sentence and then committed another offence at the age of 70, the time between those two offences would be a factor which the court could take into account along with all the circumstances surrounding the case. I do not want to say anything in Committee that would limit judges' discretion in such cases. If there was a huge time lag between the two offences and the person concerned had been of good behaviour in the 40 or 50 interim years, I should have thought that the judge could reasonably take that into account once a conviction had been reached by the court.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr mentioned the right of appeal. If the Law Officers believe that a case has been dealt with far too leniently, there is a right of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder, having listened to the explanations, whether judges will be loath to apply exceptional circumstances. As they are open to the right of appeal, I should have thought that the likelihood is that they will apply them incredibly narrowly, if at all. I have heard it suggested that judges will give the matter a huge body swerve—they will simply ignore exceptional circumstances because they will get virtually no guidelines about what is expected of them. Does the Minister think that we shall have an exceptional circumstances clause that will never be exercised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answers that I have received so far from the Minister lead me to believe that the Lord Advocate will be able to appeal against sentences when a judge has used his discretion. The Minister has consistently refused to give guidelines about judges' use of discretion. If a judge does not know what the guidelines are, how will he know whether he has gone too far in his use of discretion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put another question to the Minister? All the propaganda for the clause and for the Bill was about hitting hard dangerous members of society who could not be trusted with release because they had committed extremely serious crimes. We all thought that a first offence would attract many years' imprisonment and that the Government's proposals would relate to a person who had committed a serious reoffence. However, the Minister confirmed that a first offence could involve a sentence as short as six months. It is unfair to sentence a person to life because he has committed a previous, far less serious offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another case might involve someone who really was a serious danger to society and who deserved a very long sentence for his second crime. Automatic life sentencing would apply in both cases. That was not the message that the Government put across to the public when they argued for the application of an automatic life sentence to dangerous criminals, including those who commit, for example, murder or rape. A first offence might deserve only a light sentence. The Minister should withdraw the clause and start his thinking again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the Committee's previous sitting, I urged caution on my right hon. Friend the Minister and encouraged him to dismiss some of the ideas that are coming from Opposition Members. However, the growing mood among the Opposition is to give more guidelines to judges because that might lead to greater
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
consistency in sentencing. I believe that the Opposition have previously argued against that. If they are now arguing that judges and sheriffs should be given clear guidelines about many more instances, perhaps my right hon. Friend should listen to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more the Minister agrees with the positions that I hold, the more impressed I am by his perspicacity and wisdom. I recognise that the Bill was intended to deal with what the Government regard as dangerous members of society—perhaps including judges. Much of the Bill seems to be an attack on judges whom the Government consider to have been too weak and too lily-livered in their sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the Minister has refused to be specific about giving guidance on which judgments should be made lest he inhibit judges' flexibility and freedom. That is an acceptable balance between, on the one hand, moving the parameters to show that the Government want harsher sentences in some circumstances and, on the other, ensuring that there is still room to make exceptions. That is a great safeguard in the system. If the Government feel that the system is being wrongly applied by judges, they could change the legislation in a couple of years' time—they have done so previously. It is very frustrating when I cannot get a straight answer from the Minister but, in this case, he is right to continue to waffle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where the hon. Member for Ayr has been. I notice that the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), is leaving the Room—no, he is not. He is very quick, that lad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr referred to the Opposition and sentencing guidelines. A couple of years ago I raised the issue of a sentencing commission to make guidelines more strict. The hon. Member for Eastwood and I discussed a case a couple of years ago when a young fellow was given six months' community service for hitting an old person of 70-odd years. The issue of sentencing guidelines is important for judges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Advocate is already able to appeal against unduly lenient sentences. Is the Minister saying that he needs an appeal against exceptional circumstances? The Minister said that he does not want to limit judicial discretion. If someone from Mars came to the Committee, he would wonder who had moved the amendment. I believe that the Minister does not want to limit judicial discretion, but that the Secretary of State for Scotland does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Judges should have some guidance, but will they declare what exceptional circumstances are? In the light of Pepper v. Hart, the courts and others outside Parliament may refer to our debates for the intention of legislation. It is important to make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to someone who commits a qualifying offence at the age of 18, for which he receives a sentence of six months, and what could happen 52 years later when he is 70.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I of new schedule 5A to the 1995 Act lists qualifying offences and paragraph 8 refers to
	<br><q><p>"Lewd, libidinous or indecent behaviour".</p></q>

I know that that refers to practices against a child, but if an 18-year-old relieves himself in a close in Glasgow and it becomes a qualifying offence, for which he receives a sentence of six months, and 52 years later he decides to relieve himself again and is sentenced, he will automatically be in for the rest of his life. His pension will have to be sent to Barlinnie. Will that be the position? I want the Minister to clarify the matter before we move on because the more we examine the provision, the more it appears to be fraught with danger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recall Aneurin Bevan's comment about not sending someone

The Minister has no clothes because he has been sent to the Committee by the Secretary of State so poorly briefed that he has no answer. He has been given two or three opportunities to stand up and to put on the record for the judges the Government's interpretation of when discretion should be used, how it should be limited and when it should not be used. We are here not to dance on the head of a pin but to try to respond to what the Government believe is the agenda being demanded by the public. We are trying to respond sanely and sensibly and to divert them from their stupid and crass interpretation of what the public want. The public thought that the Secretary of State said that the Government would not allow judges to make decisions on sentencing that would be inappropriate in the light of what the public want. The oddity of that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton said, is that the Government already have a right of appeal. Twelve people were convicted of a second serious violent or sexual offence between 1990 and 1994 and the Government did not appeal against a single sentence. The Government already have the power to limit judges' discretion by appealing against sentences, but they did not do so. Perhaps the Minister will explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should also explain what limit there will be on discretion because, when people consider sentencing and the way in which the law should be carried out, they will look at what the Minister said in Committee. What did the right hon. Gentleman say when my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton asked him how judges should use that discretion—what are the limitations, how should they interpret the law and what guidelines will they be given? The Minister said that he thought he had answered all our questions but, if we read 	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, we will see that he did not tackle any of the questions put to him by four or five hon. Members. So let us get it on the record now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, when Hansard is examined tomorrow, it will record a blank space for the Minister's speech—as often happens with a Minister's speech—but that if there is a clear division between the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister, we should rally behind the banner of James in this matter?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is out of order. He should know better than to refer to a right hon. or hon. Member by his first name rather than by his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think someone once said that attacking the Minister was like throwing tomatoes at your granny; you feel ashamed about doing it. That is true, but we are trying to get through the Minister to the Secretary of State. I do not believe that the Secretary of State listens to anyone—not even to anyone on his own Front Bench. But at least he might read the report of our proceedings or what is in the press and realise what embarrassment has been caused to him and to the Government by the introduction of such a badly prepared Bill. Where are the guidelines? Will the Minister give us those guidelines or is he just going to waffle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that I will not be provoked into doing what the hon. Gentleman wants and giving instructions to judges because that would be improper. However, the right of appeal of prosecutors and Law Officers is referred to in clause 15, where it is made clear that, under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, the Lord Advocate may appeal against a decision on the basis that there were no exceptional circumstances to justify it. It is for the Lord Advocate, the Law Officers and the advocate-deputes to decide whether there were no exceptional circumstances to justify the sentence and then to appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am answering the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is open to the prosecutors to appeal against a sentence that they consider too lenient. It is for them to consider the evidence and decide whether that is appropriate in each case. There is no guarantee that an appeal will succeed and, unless the prosecutors are sure of their grounds, obviously, it would not make sense for them to go ahead with an appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) asked when judges exceeded their discretion. The answer, very simply, is when the appeal court says so in issuing guideline sentences, which it is empowered—in fact encouraged—to do. It is open to the appeal court to provide those guidelines. It is much more appropriate for the judges of appeal than for Parliament to lay down those guideline decisions. We are not seeking to limit the judges' discretion. Obviously, each case has its own circumstances. To give an obvious example, which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) will appreciate, if a kicking crowd of six youths is kicking someone in the middle, and that person dies, which of the youths is responsible for inflicting the fatal kick, which is involved in the assault and which are not involved at all? The court must take into account all the circumstances of the case, and it is not for me to say what the appropriate outcome of such a case should be. That can be judged only when all the circumstances have been heard at the trial.

The hon. Member for Maryhill raised the issue of when an offender has been found guilty of a serious offence. We believe that the victim's trauma and the harm to society should be taken into account. I accept that, on the first occasion, the High Court may have considered it appropriate to impose a sentence of less than three years, but I would want anyone so convicted to be warned that, although circumstances on the first occasion may have warranted a comparatively modest sentence, a second conviction would result in a life sentence unless there were exceptional circumstances. By the time we reach a second conviction, there might be two rapes, two deaths or two severe assaults. We should recognise that the issue of public protection may be given much greater prominence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have said, the Lord Advocate can already appeal against lenient sentences—that is, the result. But the Minister's remark about the appeal against exceptional circumstances disturbed me. Will the Lord Advocate appeal against the reasoning of the judge—the person who heard the evidence—as to why exceptional circumstances were appropriate in a case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There was an intervention on the Minister, so he still has the Floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To answer the hon. Gentleman's question, that could be the case. I have been involved as an advocate in appealing against sentences. Those points can be put to the High Court and the Appeal Court when there is an appeal against sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the Minister's response to my question when he said that there could have been two murders or two rapes. I would have more sympathy with him if that were the case, but according to paragraph 8 of the schedule on qualifying offences, we could be talking about someone streaking across a rugby ground. That would be nonsensical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister still has not answered one of the most important questions that has been put time and again. Of the 12 people convicted of a second serious assault or sexual offence between 1990 and 1994, none was given a discretionary life sentence and no sentence was appealed against. If we take that as the example, because those are the 12 most serious cases, is the Minister saying that if that happens in the future, no appeal will be made if no life sentence is given?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are trying to get some idea of what will happen. If the power to appeal was available then, as it will be in the future, and if an appeal judge decides not to apply the life sentence as outlined in the Bill, under what circumstances would that be appealed against and why? I believe that that was what the public thought the Government were saying when they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
trumpeted the Bill. Which of those 12 cases would the Minister expect to trigger an appeal? Will he give some idea of what guidelines will be given to judges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is laid down on page 19 of the Bill in the exact terms of the 1995 Act. The Lord Advocate will have to specify that no exceptional circumstances justified the court's decision in passing a particularly lenient sentence. That is the criterion on which he will have to argue his case before the Appeal Court. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East well knows that the Law Officers and procurators fiscal in Scotland do not give reasons for not prosecuting. In practice, there may be a variety of reasons such as an insufficiency of evidence or the incapacity of witnesses to give evidence through illness but no formal reason is given. I am not in a position to give reasons for decisions made in individual cases. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to complain about an individual case, he should take up the matter with the Law Officers, who will look into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to come back to this subject again, Mr. Martin, but the Minister is being deliberately obtuse about this matter. I asked him about 12 recorded cases—not 12 prosecutions, but 12 cases where people were found guilty of a second serious crime or sexual offence. Those people were not given discretionary life sentences. The power to appeal was there, but it was not used by the Government or by the Crown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to tease out of the Minister when discretion would be curtailed by the Government. The Government told the public that that was what the Bill was all about. Which one of those 12 decisions not to give life sentences did not have exceptional circumstances? Will the Minister also tell us how the situation will differ after the Bill is passed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more we see of the Bill, the more we realise how hastily it has been drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appeal against lenient sentences was against the result before; and now we find that it has gone a long way towards the reasoning of the judge. If, when there are exceptional circumstances, judges say why they gave that judgment, the Lord Advocate can appeal. What happens, however, in the following case? The judge may say, "Wait a minute. I'm going to give exceptional circumstances here and I do not want to get myself into a position where the Lord Advocate is going to appeal. So I'm just going to say exceptional circumstances—I'm not going to open my mouth any further, I'm not going to put anything down so that there's no opportunity to appeal." Could that happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat what I have said. The guidelines should be given by the appeal court. I am not giving them—the judges should decided and I shall not interfere, however much the hon. Member for Falkirk, East may wish to provoke me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister envisage judges giving reasons for exceptional circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The judges are entitled to develop sentencing guidelines in the way they believe to be most appropriate. They will do that when the High court sits as an appeal court. Gradually a body of case law will be built up, which will give guidance to other judges on the most appropriate sentences within the confines of different cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Martin, I do not want to keep on about this matter and I do not want to be obtuse, but we are discussing an important point. The Minister is talking about a different point. He is not answering the question. He is talking about sentences. I am asking him whether he envisages judges laying down in court what those exceptional circumstances are. That is important in terms of the legislation's ramifications regarding exceptional circumstances and possible appeals by the Lord Advocate. Does he envisage judges defining exceptional circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes I do. For example, there may be two similar serious rape cases, each involving a teenage girl being sexually attacked. In one case, the person concerned pleads guilty and in the other, the person tells a pack of lies and puts the young girl through the trauma of having to give all the evidence in court. The judge is entitled to take into account that where the rapist has consistently lied and put the girl through a fearful ordeal, that it is an aggravating circumstance and, accordingly, the sentence may be more severe than in a similar case where the accused pleaded guilty. Those are matters that properly lie within the discretion of the court and the judge, and it is not for the Government to set down guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has finished. Does the hon. Lady wish to speak?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am now even more confused because, in effect, on a second offence, what the Minister has just said could not possibly be the case. If the second offence of, for example, rape is to result in an automatic sentence, any defendant in such circumstances will almost certainly choose to go to trial. Yet while the offence is aggravated if it goes to trial, if a defendant does not go to trial by pleading guilty to rape, he will get the automatic life sentence anyway. People in such circumstances are in an impossible Catch-22 situation. That follows directly from what the Minister has just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that the judge sets the relevant part of the sentence and is entitled to take all the circumstances of a case into account before doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pursue that further. I thoroughly agree with the Minister that if an accused puts a victim through extra distress, the judge would be right to take that into account when sentencing. No Member of the committee would have a problem with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
that. However, I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton was asking the Minister whether the clause gives the judge the right to say merely that he thinks there are exceptional circumstances in the case, or whether he will have to explain the exceptional circumstances that have affected his judgement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister on the explanation he gave the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham)? He seemed to be saying that if someone who commits a serious sexual assault pleads guilty—saying in effect, "it was me what did it, guv"—the judge will set a lesser mandatory period unless there are exceptional circumstances. If the accused goes to court, on the other hand, and pleads not guilty, putting the victim through the trauma of being interrogated in court, the judge will probably sentence him to a longer mandatory period. The Bill seems to provide that such an offender will have to serve a mandatory life sentence. Is the Minister saying that if the offender pleads guilty, saying, "I am a terrible person and I have terrible remorse", he will not get a mandatory life sentence? The exceptional circumstances in such a case would be that the offender was good at pleading and would allow the judge to feel that he was dealing fairly with the court and the victim by imposing a lighter sentence. Is that what the Minister is saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that an automatic life sentence would apply on conviction of a second offence. However, the judge sets the relevant part and in doing so, he is entitled to take all the relevant circumstances into account. That is perfectly proper and I do not doubt that that is what will happen. The hon. Member for Maryhill asked whether the judge would have to specify the exceptional circumstances. He would not and can simply give his judgment, having taken account of all the circumstances of the case. If the Lord Advocate considers, for the reasons I have given, that the judgment should be appealed against, he can do so, although it is a power that he would use sparingly. Similarly, the Appeal Court can reduce, increase or maintain the sentence of the relevant part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to get it on the record, the Minister is, therefore, saying that it would be less troublesome for the courts—although he might have said that it would be less troublesome for the victim—for a case not to go to trial. In the aim of causing less trouble to the court, one could end up with the discretionary use of shorter sentences, regardless of the severity of the rape or the offence committed. It would depend on a defendant's performance in court. That is frightening and picks up the theme that runs through the legislation, which is that if an offender acts the part of a good prisoner in prison, he can get one-sixth of his sentence remitted. That is turning away from dealing with the problem that the public think we are dealing with. It is wrong that a judge's discretion—which he does not have to specify—can consist of whether or not a person pleads guilty, thereby saving the court a lot of trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister about an issue from which we have digressed. However, following on from the points made by the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross and my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill about young people coming before the courts, I would like to say that the Bill will increase the distress caused to young people. No one will plead guilty at trial when there is an automatic sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the issue of exceptional circumstances because it is extremely important. Exceptional circumstances can be brought out only at a trial. Pleading guilty will be a thing of the past. If exceptional circumstances are not brought out at the trial, there can be no appeal. Those matters should be dealt with in the Bill. As the Minister has given up on this issue, which exposes the fragility of the Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 2, in line 1, after "Court", insert
	<br><q><p>"on or after 1st January 1998".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 4, in page 2, line 2, leave out from "offence" to end of line 6.

No. 65, in page 2, leave out lines 3 and 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with the retrospective nature of the Bill. The day after the Bill comes into force, an automatic life sentence could be imposed, even if the first conviction predated the legislation. That cannot be right. A first conviction committed years ago under an entirely different sentencing regime should not become wrapped up with a new set of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Committee's debates are difficult because we slide backwards and forwards from subject to subject regardless of what the amendments say. Indeed, the issue of earlier offences has already been mentioned this morning. It would be a manifest injustice to apply the legislation retrospectively. There was no discussion of its retrospective nature in the White Paper, although some organisations, such as the Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, picked up on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, we discussed the issue of age and what could happen if a second offence committed after the age of 18 were wrapped up with first offence committed when someone was very young. The legislation will be applied irrespective of the age at which someone was previously convicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No amendment could deal with every set of circumstances. Even if the amendment were accepted, it would not deal with every possible case—for example, war crimes which took place many years ago under entirely different circumstances; or, perhaps more commonly, child abuse or sex abuse cases, which are often brought to court five, 10, 15, or even 20 years after the offence was committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
It is important to discuss the retrospective nature of the Bill and to try, at least, to moderate its effects. That is why the date of 1 January 1998 is proposed in the amendment. If the amendment were accepted, we would, in effect, be talking about future offenders, rather than those whose offences predated the legislation and were committed under a separate sentencing regime. That is a clear and simple point, so I shall not elaborate further on it, but I would appreciate a response from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the part of new section 205A(1)(b) that the amendments would delete is to make it clear that any previous serious offending involving conviction for a qualifying offence for automatic life will be treated as a qualifying previous conviction. As drafted, the Bill puts on notice all those previously convicted of such offences that if they are further convicted of qualifying offences committed after the Bill comes into force, they will be liable to an automatic life sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no grounds for not applying the provisions to persons who have already shown themselves to be a definite threat to public safety—Maguire is a glaring case in point. It would be morally reprehensible and irresponsible to give such people the impression that the slate was being wiped clean simply because they had been convicted—possibly on more than one occasion—of attempted murder, rape or another qualifying offence before the Bill came into effect. They will be fully aware of the possible consequences if they reoffend. The nature of the qualifying offences is such that I hope that we all agree that such persons should be given a clear message that their previous offending will be taken into account, and that they should not reoffend if they want to avoid the full effect of the law. I hope that the hon. Lady will not press her amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up one point made by the Minister. I appreciate why he keeps referring to the Maguire case—I understand its emotive nature—but the Minister knows that the vast majority of people charged with qualifying offences are guilty of acts nothing like that in the Maguire case, nor will they have received sentences approaching what might have been expected in the first Maguire conviction. We are in danger of including people whose first offences were not considered by the court—according to its sentence—to be incredibly serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to return to the issue of exceptional circumstances, but it bears on almost every part of our discussion. The vast majority of the people we are discussing are not double life or double rape offenders; their first offence may have been a severe assault, for which they received a year, two years, or something of that order. They will be included in the regime although their first qualifying conviction occurred when the Bill did not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not just the hon. Lady and other Opposition members of the Committee who support the amendment. It was drafted by the Law Society of Scotland, so it comes from people who know what they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
are talking about. The society sees the dangers involved if the Minister does not listen and amend the Bill accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the White Paper, between 1990 and 1994 there were 252 convictions for attempted murder, only 81 per cent. of which—about 200—attracted custodial sentences. In other words, nearly a fifth-20 per cent.—did not attract a custodial sentence. Such people cannot in any sense be regarded as a serious threat to public safety; if they were, they would not have been allowed out by the courts, but would have been given a custodial sentence. So there are about 50 people with a previous qualifying offence, who may find themselves facing a mandatory life sentence and whom the courts, on their first offence, thought safe enough to let onto the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to return to exceptional circumstances either, but we must do so when considering such cases. The Minister may say that the judge can use the exceptional circumstances of the qualifying case not to impose the mandatory life sentence. But that is not the case. The White Paper makes it clear that the Government are not happy with how judges have been using their discretion. Of the 252 convictions for attempted murder, only five offenders received life sentences. The Government do not like that, which is why they are introducing the clause. They want to force judges to apply mandatory life sentences more often in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady is right about how the judges will interpret the measure. The Government's intention is that judges will know about the Lord Advocate's right of appeal against any of their decisions and will be reluctant to use exceptional circumstances to let people off. People could be sent down for life sentences although everyone, including the judges, knows that they should not be. Because of the Bill and a decision taken by hon. Members in Committee, the judges will feel that they are obliged to pass life sentences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman meant automatic rather than mandatory life sentences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is mandatory for the court to give a life sentence—that is what we are discussing. The matter is set out in the notes on clauses:
	<br><q><p>"This clause requires the High Court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment".</p></q>
The clause "requires" that—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] We should not call into question the notes on clauses and the integrity of the Minister. He is a very good Minister and I am surprised at the Tory Back Bench Members. The Minister always gives the right information to Committee and hon. Members should know that and stop attacking him. Just because the Minister is a Tory does not mean that he deserves to be attacked on every case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must address the problem. It is unjust to apply law retrospectively. Often, people who are convicted have served their sentences—they are over and done with and the people are equal before the law. The Minister is now claiming that they must be treated
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
differently from everyone else. They might well get involved in a serious crime in the future, but so will others who do not have convictions. There is no saying that one person is more of a threat to society than any other. The best thing would be to leave the matter to courts, judges and other experienced people who deal with such cases week-in, week-out. They know how to handle each case in accordance with its individual circumstances instead of playing politics and forcing the imposition of sentences that nobody in the court, perhaps not even the Procurator Fiscal, agrees with. That is the danger that we could face because the Government choose to play politics with the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used a specific phrase when he said that the legislation effectively puts previous offenders on notice of the situation. On a simple, technical point, precisely how will that happen? What measures will be taken to ensure that all those who have committed a qualifying offence in previous decades—that is the length of time that we are discussing—are aware that the legislation will apply directly to them? Are the Government assuming that those people will all read 	<i>The Scotsman</i> or 	<i>The Herald</i> for their information? Some people will simply not realise about or understand the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a Bill is enacted, the facts relating to its provisions become public knowledge on a wide basis and are publicised. I have no doubt that the relevant people will be made aware of the new legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady mentioned crimes that were committed long ago. Again, I stress that the judge can specify exceptional circumstances. I should make clear what we envisage as likely to happen. Crimes that would attract automatic life sentences are certainly not trivial. They are serious offences and the convictions would have to be made in the High Court. I submit that it will not often arise that a conviction for a serious offence could be disregarded in any respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first answer the point about exceptional circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A judge could specify what the exceptional circumstances were in his or her view, and, in most cases, we would expect that to be done. In the event of an appeal, the judge would have to specify those circumstances in a report to the Appeal Court. In the first trial, the judge could specify those circumstances—and we should expect that to be done in most cases—and he or she would have to do so if there were an appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the relevant qualifying offences are very serious and that persons found guilty of them have committed a serious offence and are a threat to the public. According to the right hon. Gentleman's own figures, over the past four years in more than 50 cases people were found guilty of relevant offences but were not thought by the High Court to constitute a threat to the public—the offender did not receive a custodial sentence. Does the right

hon. Gentleman think that those offenders should now be dealt with as if they were a threat to the public despite the High Court's ruling? If so, is he calling into question or disregarding the judgement of High Court judges, who reach their decision by taking into account all the circumstances of the case? Is he proposing that those people must now be regarded as a threat to the public and does he think that they should receive an automatic life sentence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman examines the qualifying offences, which include, for instance, attempted murder—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fifty-odd people were let go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a person is convicted of attempted murder on a second occasion, there is no doubt about the fact that that person is a threat to the community. If there were exceptional circumstances in the case the judge could properly take them into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Bill to endorse and safeguard the public's protection to a very much greater extent than has been the case to date. We want to make things as hard as possible for murderers or attempted murderers. In response to the hon. Member for Maryhill, it should be noted that culpable homicide is a qualifying offence—I mentioned two deaths earlier. If a person is convicted of causing a death for the second time by culpable homicide the provisions will bite. It is necessary to protect the public against crimes of great violence. The 	<i>Daily Record</i> poll showed that about 93 per cent. supported honesty in sentencing, which is clear evidence that the public support our proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The group of amendments relates, in the first instance, to a perceived mismatch between offences committed in Scotland and those committed in England and Wales. We will consider that in detail when we discuss a later group of amendments but, in general terms, there is a real problem with the list of relevant offences in the Scottish Bill compared with those in the English legislation. It seems that there has simply been an attempt to put something equivalent in the Scottish Bill to match up the lists, but it results in several problems. As I said, a separate group of amendments deals with some of the specific issues but I should like to speak about the matter in more general terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, relevant offences include offences committed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as listed in the separate English and Welsh legislation. The offences in that legislation are not on all fours with the qualifying offences specified in this Bill. For example, sodomy or its English equivalent, buggery, does not appear at all in the English list. Lewd, libidinous or indecent behaviour does not appear in the English list either. Furthermore, the provisions relating to assault are mismatched. The Scottish common law of assault is not the same as the statutory offence of assault in the English jurisdiction. This is difficult because we are dealing with two entirely separate legal jurisdictions—there is a tendency to forget that—yet the legislation sets qualifying offences for England and Wales, as well as for Scotland. The provisions relating to unlawful intercourse with girls are different in Scotland, England and Wales, where intercourse is unlawful with a girl under 13, and Northern Ireland, where it is an offence if the girl is under 14. Therefore, qualifying offences could mean something quite different if the original conviction took place in a different jurisdiction. The structural
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
differences of the legal systems in Scotland and in England and Wales make it difficult to see how the legislation will work well in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady saying that if someone commits an offence, which is a relevant offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and then commits a qualifying offence in Scotland, an automatic life sentence will follow, but, that if the relevant offence, for example intercourse with a young girl of 13 and a half, took place in Northern Ireland, it would not be the same as the offence of intercourse with a 13 year old in England? That shows the anomalies that exist in terms of relevant offences?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct, and it is only one of the anomalies. There are others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think I can assist the hon. Lady. She is discussing amendments Nos. 11 and 12 to 17, which deal with actual offences. It might be convenient for the Committee if, in addition to the amendments that I have listed, I also allow debate on the other amendments. That will allow the hon. Lady and any other member of the Committee to discuss the actual offences. If I do not do that, hon. Members will be restricted to amendment No. 3.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, Mr. Martin. It was difficult to keep the two matters separate. I shall deal with some of the specific offences later but I want to conclude my general comments. Although only one of our English friends is present at the moment, I should explain that there are some marked differences between the way in which procedure works in Scotland compared to that in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the offences described in this Bill are common law offences which means that in court the indictment often has a lengthy and detailed list of multiple charges. In order for the prosecutor to be absolutely safe and certain in his or her ability to get evidence before the court, the charge has to be outlined in great detail, starting with the most serious part of the offence but including every aspect of what might have taken place. If the prosecutor does not do that, evidence about something that is not in the charge cannot be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
The prosecutor has to think extremely carefully about precisely what is in the charge when it is drawn up. Given the mismatch of offences, it looks as though it will be difficult in some cases to draw proper comparisons. Either we confine this list to the jurisdiction of Scotland alone—in which case, we will all be perfectly clear that the offences are relevant and fit—or, if it is extended beyond that jurisdiction, there is no reason why it should be extended only to England and Wales. There is no reason whatsoever why people convicted of offences in other parts of the European Union should not also be wrapped into this Bill. The jurisdictional difference is not going to be any harder to match up. Some of the amendments refer to including the other states in the European Union in case the amendments to confine it to Scotland are not accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolute nonsense. The House has control over legislation for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. It does not have control over other European countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, we are talking about two separate legal jurisdictions—Scotland, and England and Wales. We are already in difficulty by attempting to compare crimes in Scotland with those in England and Wales. The hon. Member for Ayr is right to the extent that I would prefer to restrict jurisdiction to Scotland. We were not going to attempt to argue that a crime, which is almost certainly libelled in England as a statutory offence with a statutory definition, is equivalent to a crime in Scotland which is a common law crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The common law of Scotland allows for huge latitude when charges are drawn up. The hon. Gentleman will know that breach of the peace in Scotland—usually regarded as a minor charge—is nevertheless a common law offence which, theoretically, could attract a life sentence depending on the breach. The charge is compared to the jurisdiction where most offences are defined statutorily. Indeed, the proposed list of qualifying offences includes offences which, as far as I am aware, are not offences in Scotland. For example, "incitement to commit murder" is not a known, named offence in Scotland. I understand that it may be one in England, but as I am not qualified in English law that is not part of my knowledge, I have never seem "incitement to commit murder" in Scottish law and I do not know what it is. As far as I am aware, there is no such offence in Scotland, but it is on the list and I do not know what it means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On rape or attempted rape, clandestine injury in Scotland is an alternative charge to rape. I do not know if there is an equivalent offence in England and Wales, but why is clandestine injury not included on the list when rape or attempted rape is included? For those who may not know, an example of clandestine injury is when sex without consent occurs when the woman is asleep. The question of consent cannot arise because she was asleep, so the offence cannot be rape, which, by definition, means sexual intercourse without consent, but it can be clandestine injury, which is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
treated like a rape offence. Clandestine injury is not on the list and I do not know if there is an equivalent offence in England and Wales. It seems ridiculous to include as a qualifying offence a previous conviction for rape but not for clandestine injury. Charges of clandestine injury do not come up in court by the dozen every year, but they do occur. Given that it is an alternative charge to rape, it is nonsense to leave it out. That arises because a list has been taken from English legislation and put into Scottish legislation with no consideration for the separate set of circumstances in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might assist the Committee if I say that I am inclined to accept amendment No. 12 to meet the point that the hon. Lady is making on clandestine injury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. That encourages me to go into even more detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the principle. The drafting will have to be sorted out, but I recognise the merit in what the hon. Lady said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly obliged to the Minister. There are other specific matters to be considered. The Minister accepts the principle of amendment No. 12 on clandestine injury, but has he formed a view on the principle of incitement to commit murder, which, as I said, is an offence that is not known in Scotland. It is nonsense to include something on a list in Scottish legislation when it is not a named offence in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13 refers to sodomy or attempted sodomy, which is not a crime when there is consent and the parties are over the age of 18. The Bill states:
	<br><q><p>"where, in either case, one party does not consent"—</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult matter. When there is no consent, sodomy or attempted sodomy is always a criminal offence. The law allows that for consenting adults over the age of 18 it is not an offence, but what does the Minister envisage concerning those under 18? The position is not clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I am obliged to my hon. Friend for coming to my assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that there is a charge of male rape in England, but not in Scotland? Perhaps that is why the measure exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak with any true knowledge of the English circumstances in respect of male rape. I am not aware whether there is an English charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15, which would leave out the words, "at some time" and amendment No. 16, which would leave out the words, "or an imitation firearm" aim to elicit what was understood about a specific offence. I am not clear what
	<br><q><p>"at some time during the commission of the offence"</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
means. This is a genuine question and not just a rhetorical debating point. If, for example, someone drove to a bank with a shotgun in the boot of the car and performed a robbery without the gun—which might have been in the car boot for some time—what would happen if he was then picked up once back in the car to get away? The commission of the offence would include travelling to, being in and leaving the bank. That would all be part of the charge. Does the fact that the shotgun happened to be in the person's possession—as it would be, being in the boot of the car—mean that it would be included as part of the crime, although it was not actually used during the robbery in the bank? That allows for injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, I wonder whether robbery using an imitation firearm should be included in the schedule. If we are considering automatic sentences for second offences, I wonder whether a first offence using an imitation firearm should count as a qualifying offence. We should stick to very serious crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 17 would replace "towards a child" with
	<br><q><p>"or indecent assault or shameless indecency"</p></q>
so that paragraph 8 of Schedule 5A would read:
	<br><q><p>"Lewd, libidinous or indecent behaviour or practices or indecent assault or shameless indecency".</p></q>
I wonder whether that should apply for all cases. That is just a small point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole issue is quite important. To return to my earlier comments, we are dealing with two separate jurisdictions. I know that hon. Members from other parties expect nationalists to take such a line. I am not one of those SNP Members who has had much previous recourse to quoting the Act of Union. In fact, I cannot remember one occasion in my entire political history when I have done so. However, it is important to repeat that the Act of Union made it clear that the legal jurisdiction of Scotland would remain separate from that of England. That has always been the case and we have been very proud of it. I know that all hon. Members who come from the legal profession share that pride.

There is a danger that the Bill attempts to make our law in Scotland conform to a different set of circumstances. Minimum sentencing is an import from south of the border. It will have practical effects on what happens in Scotland. Offences in Scotland are not defined by statute and that creates a situation different from that in England and Wales. Common law offences in Scotland are designed to cover a huge range of activities and are presented in Scottish courts under different circumstances from those in England and Wales; juries in Scotland can delete parts of offences and can choose to bring back a guilty verdict of culpable homicide, even though the charge is murder. A jury in Scotland can go away, examine all the facts and circumstances and come back saying that they do not find someone guilty of murder. They, not the judge, make that decision and that is different from English courts, where juries do not have such a power. That is an example of the differences in practice that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
have become part of Scottish law as distinct from English and Welsh law. The whole court procedure is different and that has to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a concern, shared by Lord Hope, that the policy that is being imported into Scotland cannot be sensibly applied under Scottish procedure and without causing confusion and distortion to the conduct of criminal trials. I have said that English offences are mainly statutory whereas Scottish offences are mainly common law offences which are wider and more flexible, taking in a wider range of conduct. That means that an offence that is apparently equivalent to a Scottish offence may not in fact be equivalent in any way. The method of charging is different and the differences in jury powers make it difficult to draw obvious comparisons between cases. To avoid confusion, the Bill should relate to all offences committed within the jurisdiction of Scotland—that is, relevant offences, previous qualifying offences and so on—and not to offences committed in England and Wales. However, if it is to relate to offences committed in England and Wales, we may as well say that everyone within the European Union should be brought into its ambit. I am obliged to the Minister for his concession on clandestine injury, but I hope that he will also consider some of the other points I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I wish to address the issue of sodomy. Sodomy is defined as unnatural carnal connection between male persons; sodomy in private between consenting men over the age of 21 was legalised by section 80 of the Criminal Justice Act 1980. The age limit was lowered to 18 in section 13 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995. In cases where one person, irrespective of age, does not consent, sodomy is assault and therefore criminal behaviour. In what circumstances do the Government envisage sodomy taking place without one party's consent where that would not in any case be criminal? What does it add to the definition to say "non-consenting"? Are the Government saying that sodomy between two consenting 17-year-olds would not result in a life sentence for either party? If they are saying that, they are changing the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act by the back door. It is to clarify that that we want to know precisely what the Government are doing. Non-consenting sodomy is criminal irrespective of one's age. It appears that the phraseology used adds nothing to the definition, so is there any change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross on raising these important matters. I am sure that the Minister will explain what the clause means. He should say whether he is talking about exactly matching offences for which a person has been found guilty in the English courts or something approximating to the offence in a Scottish court. If the Minister means "approximating to", there will be a huge field of endeavour for lawyers—perhaps the Bill should be renamed the "Lawyers Bonanza Bill". If he means something else, he should say precisely what it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
However, I shall now part company with the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross. I do not know the detail of the law in other European countries, but I know that we in Britain operate on a principle of being innocent until proven guilty, which might not always be so in other jurisdictions. I know also that courts in other countries have different standards of admissible evidence, so a person could be found guilty in a French court on evidence that would not have been permitted in a Scottish court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that small point, that difficulty already exists because the laws of evidence in Scotland are different from those in England and Wales and our requirements for corroboration are much higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has anticipated what I was about to say. Very few of us can possibly be aware of what might be substantial differences between our courts and those in other parts of the European Union, but there are known differences between our courts and English courts. Yet the Bill takes no account of the fact that a person could be found guilty in an English court but not in a Scottish court, or vice versa, because of different ideas of what is admissible evidence. The Minister must address that problem if life sentences are to be given for second offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to make another practical point about the difference between English and Scottish practice. I stand to be corrected, but I understand that, in English courts, it is relatively unusual for all outstanding offences, especially sexual offences, to go to trial at the same time, whereas that is pretty much standard practice in Scotland. We would expect all such charges to go to trial together. Up to 20 separate charges are frequently included in one indictment in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the proposed system operate in practice? Is there a bearing between whether the accused faces a second conviction and the imposition of an automatic life sentence? It is unclear what is envisaged. For example, if the accused is convicted on the same indictment of two or more charges of attempted murder or rape, would that constitute both a first and second conviction? Would both crimes be qualifying offences even though they took place on different dates? I have seen people convicted of murder and attempted murder. If such charges were on the same indictment, would that represent a qualifying offence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady accept that the answer is: no, it would have to be a totally separate crime committed earlier, not part of a package of charges put before the High Court on one instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister, but as I understand it, in England the practice would be to have the charges put separately, even if they were related. For example, sex offences in England and Wales tend to be dealt with separately, whereas in Scotland they would be dealt with together. Again, it is difficult to apply measures across the board when practice is so different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a very useful debate. In response to the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross, different offences exist; the two Bills do not mirror each other exactly; there are differences in the list reflecting the differences in criminal law north and south of the border, and no exact parallels can be drawn. Our basic approach is to send out a message: people who move cannot evade the consequences of repeat offending. We have restricted the list to convictions for serious offences; that has also been the approach in other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the withdrawal of amendment No. 3, which would have the effect of taking out of account an offender's previous convictions for serious crimes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is difficult to find any justification for proposing that all references to offences committed elsewhere in the United Kingdom should be deleted while at the same time proposing to add references to convictions for serious offences in other European Union member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty in using convictions from other parts of the European Union is that we do not have sufficient comprehensive records from other countries to formalise procedures as proposed in the amendments; we certainly have such information within the United Kingdom. I do not think that I need to elaborate further on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 11, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder and assault to severe injury are considered serious enough to be qualifying offences for automatic life, but incitement to commit murder is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would happen in the case of a terrorist offence in which an attempted murder is dealt with as a scheduled offence under the prevention of terrorism Act, where a trial judge presides alone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that it would count; it would be caught by the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also make it clear that attempting to arrange matters so that a third party commits homicide is a recognised crime in Scotland and is referred to as such by the main authorities. Someone who is guilty of incitement to murder is no less of a serious threat to public safety than those who attempt or conspire to commit murder, who are in turn little less of a threat than those who actually carry out the act. I therefore hope that that amendment will not be pressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what has been said about a lack of comparability with south of the border. Complete comparability is impossible because of the differences in our respective laws. We should proceed first from conduct which we in Scotland consider to present a threat to public safety; the list in the Bill provides a proper description of such conduct. I do not believe that it would be improved by the deletion of incitement to murder, which stands alongside attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder as a serious crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point, as far as I am aware, there is no such named crime in Scotland as incitement to commit murder. There is attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder, but as far as I am aware incitement to murder does not exist as a crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It certainly does under the terms of the Bill. If someone were to pay someone else £10,000 to kill someone, I should say that was incitement to commit murder. I see no reason at all for deleting that aspect from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>On that point</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady can come back on that point when I have finished. I want to deal with her other points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that amendments Nos. 15 and 16 will unduly narrow the circumstances in which robbery with a firearm would be a qualifying offence for automatic life. If the term "at some time" were removed, possession of a firearm would be required during the whole commission of the offence for it to be a qualifying offence. Apart from the difficulty of proving that, it would enable an offender to avoid the provision by arranging for someone else to carry the firearm or by throwing it away before the offence was completed. That would not be acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, removing "imitation firearm" from the definition would break a long-standing policy under firearms legislation that offences committed with imitation firearms must be treated as seriously as those committed with firearms that can be used. The justification is simple: to treat them as less serious would be to invite criminals to use imitation firearms, which can be as frightening and coercive as real firearms. The police must treat them just as seriously because, until the matter is investigated, they cannot know whether the firearms are real. It is often impossible to tell the difference, especially in stressful situations. There is every reason to regard a criminal who robs using an imitation firearm as a serious threat to public order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be concern that "an imitation firearm" may catch trivial attempts to simulate the possession of a firearm. That concern, however, is addressed by the reality that only convictions in the High Court would count as qualifying convictions. Only serious offences involving the use of a firearm would come within those convictions that could lead to automatic life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross for tabling amendment No. 12. Although the offence of "clandestine injury" to women is committed relatively infrequently, it is of the kind that should fall within the range of offences. In principle, therefore, as I stated, I am prepared to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sodomy is an offence in its own right. The reason for defining the conduct qualifying towards an automatic life sentence as
	<br><q><p>"Sodomy or attempted sodomy where, in either case, one party does not consent"</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
was to make it clear that the mischief that the Bill seeks to address is the commission of the offence where it takes the form of an assault. That addresses what might be described as male rape, for which no separate offence exists in Scotland. Male rape is the term used south of the border. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Lady will not press amendment No. 13 to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 14 seeks to widen the list of qualifying offences. Although I appreciate hon. Members' efforts to make the list of qualifying offences as complete as possible, I have concerns about including an assault that is only aggravated because it is carried out to the victim's "permanent disfigurement". Where such an assault is serious, if permanent disfigurement is libelled, it will normally be libelled with severe injury or danger to life. If it is libelled by itself, that would probably indicate that the assault and the disfigurement were of a less serious nature involving, for example, minor scarring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, therefore, reluctant to agree to the amendment. Equally, other aggravations, such as permanent impairment, are also likely to be minor if they are not libelled together with serious injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to offences "towards a child", amendment No. 17 would appear to attract the statutory offence of indecency with girls aged 13 to 16. At present, the maximum sentence for that offence is two years in custody. I accept that we have already acknowledged through amending legislation in clause 12 that that maximum may be inadequate. Even if those amendments are agreed to, however, a strong distinction will still be drawn between lewd and libidinous practices with those who are so young that they cannot give valid consent—where the maximum is life—and the statutory offence, which involves girls of an age above which consent can be validly given. Much of such offending is likely to concern only teenagers and is not likely to be of the type that identifies the offender as a threat to public safety. Indecent assault, if charged, will involve lesser offending than that described by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the amendment was not intended to lessen the gravity of offences against children, but to broaden the legislation by saying that other offences could be just as serious. For example, practices against an 85-year-old woman or a pregnant woman could be included. The amendment is intended to ensure that the gravity of offences across the spectrum is recognised. Will the Minister comment on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but the list as given is sufficiently comprehensive to deal with the worst cases. Framing indictments according to the crimes that can be charged is a great skill and those crimes have been worked out over many centuries. The existing common law of Scotland will not be affected, although the new provisions give statutory backing to additional protection for the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
Indecent assault, if charged, will involve lesser offending than that described in the Bill. It is not appropriate that convictions for that offence should lead to automatic life sentences. Shameless indecency is not a crime of violence or assault. It does not involve the sort of conduct that clause 1 seeks to address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the hon. Member for Dundee, East or the hon. Member for Maryhill referred to lewd, libidinous or indecent behaviour or practices towards a child. That is of course a serious offence and not a minor crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not responded to my point about the different standards of evidence in different courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The laws relating to evidence in Scotland will still apply. Those relating to evidence south of the border are slightly different. The supreme court in Scotland for criminal cases is not the House of Lords, but the High Court of Appeal. That will remain the position and the laws of evidence will remain in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 5 is extremely important and I had envisaged reaching it earlier. We have been delayed somewhat. It deals with the crucial issue of judicial discretion. We think that the Bill contains flaws involving judicial discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross said that, as a nationalist, she would not quote the treaty of Union. I am not a political nationalist and will quote the treaty of Union. I can see my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East getting agitated about that. The continuance of Scots law in the Scottish courts was provided for in article XIX of the treaty. It said that the Court of Session and the Court of Justiciary should continue for all time, that the Court of Admiralty should always be continued in Scotland and that no causes in Scotland should be "cognoscible" by the Courts of Chancery, Queen's Bench, Common Pleas or any other court in Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinctiveness of Scots law is important. The treaty goes on to say that no alteration should be made in laws that concern private rights, except for evident utility of the subjects within Scotland. The import of the clause is the fact that what Lord Hope would have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
described as alien ideas have been imported into Scots law, and that they have been preserved by the treaty of the Union. The phrase "alien ideas" suggests not that they are inferior but that they have no place in Scots law, which has developed over hundreds of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to what Lord Hope—the distinguished Lord President of the Court of Session—said on the matter. He made several speeches in Scotland, the last of which was to the Law Society of Scotland in September, when he sat beside the Minister. He was a little bit dis-chuffed that the Minister did not reply to his comments—he felt that a debate was taking place in a vacuum. In that speech, Lord Hope said that he was worried about
	<br><q><p>"the introduction of the idea of a minimum sentencing into our common law, where the offences are not defined by statue at all. These common law offences have been designed to cover a wide field of human activity. And they are presented in our Courts under Scottish procedure in regard to the form of the indictment, in regard to the method of going to trial and in regard to the way in which we take verdicts on them from Scottish juries. These all differ fundamentally from the practice of criminal law, in the jurisdiction where the idea of minimum sentences originated."</p></q>
He was referring in particular to the ideas of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), whose suggestions we firmly oppose. Lord Hope went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"In my opinion … the more elaborate the list of offences becomes"—</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
as illustrated by page 3 of the Bill—
	<br><q><p>"the differences between English and Scottish practice tend to be ignored, or at least misunderstood and underestimated by those in England who are unfamiliar with the criminal law of Scotland and criminal procedure in our courts. It is therefore vital, if the integrity of our own system is to be preserved, that a firm stand is taken to stop English assumptions and English practices dictating how we practice our own system in this country."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
