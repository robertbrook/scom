	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we start our proceedings, I wish to make three brief announcements. First, it may be helpful if I remind hon. Members that notice of questions for the meeting of the Committee in Montrose on 17 February should be tabled by 5 pm tomorrow. Secondly, I remind members of the public who may not be used to the Committee's proceedings, or those at the House of Commons, that they are not allowed to make a noise or applaud speeches. Thirdly, short speeches from members of the Committee would be welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is still a large number of people outside the Room who want to hear the debate. Given that there are many empty seats on the Government Benches, would it be possible for those people to use them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting thought, but I think that the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish first to express, on behalf of all members of the Committee, our pleasure at meeting in Selkirk and our thanks to the Scottish Borders council for the arrangements that it has made for us today. When my parliamentary colleagues were considering a venue for our debate, we thought it fitting that it should be in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel), who will soon be retiring as a Member of Parliament. I know that I speak for political friends and opponents alike when I pay tribute to the 32 years of his distinguished service, not just to the political life of Scotland, on the international and national stage, but at a constituency level, serving the people and interests of this special part of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We chose deliberately to debate education and local government finance today. As the scenes outside the Room have shown, that subject is of great concern to people in the Scottish Borders and, indeed, throughout Scotland. We are debating it on the day after the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities published a report, which it commissioned from Pieda. The report showed that the spending restrictions this year and next
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
year could be responsible for as many as 17,000 job losses in Scotland, and the loss of about £315 million in household income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, we are debating the matter on the day when chief officials of local government services in Scotland felt obliged to make their views known publicly in a letter to 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> They wrote.
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not dispute the Government's right to determine its public spending priorities, but it is important to understand the consequences for local government services. It is equally important to be aware of the many new duties and responsibilities which have been placed on local government as a result of public demand, or new legislation. These new responsibilities must be properly funded."</p></blockquote>
It is significant that those are the views of officials with no party political axe to grind. Since Friday, I have had the pleasure of being in the Borders with my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). Apart from enjoying the air, it has given me an opportunity to experience at first hand the sense of anger and outrage felt by so many local residents about the scale of possible cuts in services, especially in education, which will be forced on the Scottish Borders council by the Government's straitjacket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 500 people attended a public consultation meeting held in Galashiels on Friday night to voice their concerns about the matter. On Saturday, in the main street of Hawick, people were only too anxious to sign a petition calling on the Secretary of State to think again. It is the recognition of the value of a broad, high-quality education system, and the threat directed by the Government at the heart of that system, that are fuelling such concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such worries are not confined to the Scottish Borders. A little over two weeks ago, I visited Uyeasound primary school in Unst—the northernmost island in Britain. For the second time in two years, its future is being reviewed, even though the school roll has more than doubled during that time. The Shetland Islands council is also reviewing the future of two other primary schools, one being at Haroldswick in Unst where, reluctantly, school board members have accepted the inevitability of closure; the other is Quarff primary school, whose future is threatened as the Shetland Islands council tries to keep within its budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the other half of my constituency, the chairmen of the Stromness academy and Kirkwall grammar school boards wrote to me, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parents and teachers feel strongly that schools in Orkney have been hit hard enough over the last few years and that any further reductions in human and material resources could only lead to a drop in the current high standards maintained in our schools."</p></blockquote>
The leader of Argyll and Bute council wrote to me, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The unique combination of circumstances which affects our financial position menas that we are not discussing efficiency savings, but service cuts which will seriously affect the provision of school education, community education, social work services, libraries and sports facilities, roads and transportation, as well as the financial support which we provide extensively to groups and organisations throughout Argyll and Bute."</p></blockquote>
In Edinburgh, possible proposed savings include 44 redundancies being made in education, community centres being closed in the evenings and weekends and the scrapping of hot school meals—sometimes the only hot meal that many young children have in a day. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
closure of community centres cannot happen in a vacuum. Many young people go there in the evenings; if they cannot go to a community centre, we may find trouble building up on the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Dundee, cuts of £4 million in education are reported, including the doubling of music tuition fees. Those cuts, serious enough in themselves, come on top of the cuts made this year, many of which were quite well documented by the Educational Institute of Scotland in its leaflet. Indeed, the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland estimates a cut of £90 in education budgets in the current year, and it claims that early indications are that Scotland will suffer cuts of as much as £104 million in 1997–98.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lifeblood is being sucked out of the education system in Scotland. Some of the consequences were eloquently expressed at that consultation meeting in Galashiels on Friday night. For example, any threat to physical education teaching is a threat to the teaching of a subject important to the health of young people. It is an essential part of a balanced curriculum, which helps to develop some of the skills that every adult needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The threat to curriculum support teachers in the expressive arts undermines the Government's stated objective, set out in the five to 14 curriculum programme, which stresses that the development of the expressive arts is not a frill but is important in developing abilities and methods of communication, and that it makes an important social and economic contribution to society. The Government's own words are now under threat. The withdrawal of curriculum support music teachers will put added pressure on classroom teachers, who may not be able to teach music on their own—and out of the window will go school concerts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Gentleman with great interest. He mentions the threat of cuts. He should be aware—I am sure that he is—that Scottish Borders council is permitted to increase its expenditure this year by some £2 million. Has the hon. Gentleman asked the convenor of the council whether he, the convenor, has discussed the projected cuts with his full council? those cuts represent £8 million more than the permitted increase. There should be no cuts, but an increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The convenor of Scottish Borders council presented a cogent case at that meeting in Galashiels on Friday night. He clearly spelled out what limitations the Government were placing on the council. Those limitations take no account of many other factors such as inflation, pay awards or new responsibilities. For instance, the council will have to pay the costs of implementing the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 and the possible cost of implementing the Flood Prevention and Land Drainage (Scotland) Bill. No account has been taken of the important measures needed to improve school safety, or of the increase in demands, week by week, for social services in the Scottish Borders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Borders council has had an increase?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that Borders council has had a very small increase, but it does not come anywhere near making those new responsibilities affordable in the forthcoming year. I shall return to the question of the financial prudence of Scottish Borders council in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue that sparks more indignation than most is the threat to music tuition. In some areas, charges were introduced last year and the threat is that instrumental instruction may have to cease. Many young people will thus be denied the opportunity to broaden their horizons, an opportunity that they have enjoyed until now through an appreciation of and participation in making music.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be said that the parents of some children will be able to pay for music tuition—they will be able to find private instructors or pay the increased fees. But what will happen to children with parents on low incomes? Perhaps for those with parents on the lowest incomes, tuition will be means-tested and they may be able to receive it, but it will not be possible for many children of parents on incomes just above income support level to enjoy the opportunities for making music that have hitherto been available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. When we watched the Secretary of State laughing and grinning about these savage cuts, did he remember that when the Conservatives ran my local council in Edinburgh they axed 1,000 teaching posts—among them the critical posts of music, arts and crafts, which the hon. Gentleman has highlighted—and that it took a Labour council to restore those posts? Is not it an absolute disgrace that all the Conservatives can offer us today is their laughing, grinning and smiling at the plight of the hon. Gentleman's constituents, with which we deeply sympathise—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I once again remind members of the public that interruptions of any sort, including clapping, are not allowed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is understandable after such a good intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can do without hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) making such points, because it does not help to maintain the order of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) has made a valid point, because it is subjects such as music and the expressive arts that give Scottish education the reputation that it has had for being a broad education. Of course, learning to read, write and count is of supreme importance, but developing a rounded personality and the potential of every individual also means allowing children to develop other aspects of their character through music and the expressive arts. That is what is under threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his courtesy in giving way. Does not he think it extraordinary of Labour Members of Parliament to criticise a budget
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
which their shadow Chancellor has said he would not increase if he were in office? I absolutely agree with what the hon. Gentleman has to say about music tuition, but does he not think it extraordinary that, given an increased budget—which it has been acknowledged they have—councillors choose as their priority the cutting of music tuition? Is not that playing politics with children in a disgraceful way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the right hon. Gentleman is the one who is playing politics by choosing the cheap headline—grabbing of taking a penny off income tax, when the services on which young people in our community depend are under threat. I will return to the Labour party's position, but we have now reached the stage when councils face such competing priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing not just the effect of one year's cuts but the cumulative effects. Last night, a lady in Galashiels asked why cuts are now affecting the classroom. It is because the fat has gone, the marrow has gone and we are now cutting the bone. We have had year upon year of cumulative cuts—that is why such harsh and difficult decisions on priorities are having to be made. Councils across Scotland are facing difficult choices. The capping limit for the Scottish borders has been raised by only 0.65 per cent. As I told the Secretary of State, that does not take account of, or provide flexibility for, inflation, pay awards and the new responsibilities that councils face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Gentleman does not seek to mislead the Committee, but although the capping limit has been raised by that amount, other items are not subject to capping. In fact, expenditure can increase by 1.9 per cent. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would acknowledge that and would not want to mislead the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even a rise of 1.9 per cent. is less than the Government's anticipated inflation rate. And it does not take account of seatbelts in minibuses. The Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, to which I spoke on Friday, says that councils that are now renewing tenders for school transport for the next three years have been asked to take account of inflation over that period at the rate of about 15 per cent.—a rate much higher than the Government's figures. Such matters have to be taken into account, but the Government seem to take no account of them. They take no account of the cost of implementing the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 or of the additional responsibilities that the Committee discussed in our previous sitting when debating the Flood Prevention and Land Drainage (Scotland) Bill. That is the reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot point an accusing finger of profligacy at Scottish Borders council. It employs 37 per cent, fewer staff per 1,000 head of population than the Scottish average. In an answer to my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweedale, Ettrick and Lauderdale on the amount of uncollected poll tax and council tax, about which the Government are making great play. It was shown that Scottish Borders council had the third best record of local taxation collection n the Scottish mainland. The only crumb of comfort that has been offered by the Secretary of State so far in our debate on local government expenditure is £3 million towards collecting uncollected local taxation and an acknowledgement that what is collected may also be spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
The two islands councils in my constituency have the best record in Scotland for collecting local taxation and the Liberal-Democrat led administration in Aberdeenshire has the best mainland record for such collection. Councils such as those and Scottish Borders council are now finding that they have to pay a penalty for their previous prudence and will not get the same level of benefit as other councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the debate is to try to make Ministers see how the consequences of their policy are threatening the lifeblood of our educational system and to get them to address the problem with adequate funding. There is no sign in the White Paper, "Raising the Standard", which was published on Friday, that the Government have begun to understand the gravity of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If properly done, there is much to commend teacher appraisals. But the Government complain—and I have seen quotes from the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), the Minister responsible for education—that the participation rate has been far too low in some parts of Scotland, so appraisal will now be put on a statutory footing. That fails to appreciate that if appraisal is to be property done, it requires the head teacher to spend quality time wit the teacher being appraised. To do that, the teacher will not be in the classroom, so support teachers will be required. Where will the money come from when local authorities are strapped for cash? The Government fail to appreciate the financial consequences of some of their proposals. How can the people of Scotland understand £800,000 being spent on a pre-election advertising campaign for nursery vouchers when some vital educational services are under threat? I do not think that they will be taken in by that sort of publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sort of priority do the Government have when they are making provision for additional assisted places for the few, while for the many the story will be larger class sizes, less breadth in the curriculum for secondary pupils, less music tuition, less equipment, fewer books, unrepaired buildings, less school transport, dearer school meals, and perhaps no hot meals? That is the scale of the problem and one which faces the many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State recently told COSLA:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no pot of gold under my bed."</p></blockquote>
The shadow Secretary of State was quoted as saying at a Scottish Forum for Business lunch that Labour had no "secret pot of gold" for councils. When the Prime Minister has such difficulty in getting his candidates to sing from the same hymn sheet on Europe, it is rather telling that both the Secretary of State and the shadow Secretary of State manage to sing in harmony on the subject of local government spending cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To claim that there are no resources is simply not true. The Scottish block could have been increased to the tune of £180 million or more if the Chancellor had not opted to try to win a headline by cutting the standard rate of income tax by 1p. Liberal Democrats said then that it would be paid for in higher council taxes and reduced services. When we divided the House against that tax cut, the Labour party sat on its hands and forfeited any credibility in a campaign to protect vital public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is a vital service and investment in it is essential if Scotland is to be competitive in the 21st century and a generation of young Scots are to be given
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
the opportunity to fulfil their potential. We shall not compete successfully on the basis of a low-wage, low-skill work force—plenty of countries will do that better than us. Our competitive edge must come from doing what other countries cannot do better: better design, better marketing, higher added value to better innovation, taking full advantage of the revolution in communications and information technology. That all requires proper investment in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is frustrating that when we should be investing in education, to equip our young people with skills to meet the challenges of the millennium, we are engaging in a debate to keep secure the fabric of what we already have. As the head teacher of Philip Haugh community school in Selkirk, Sheena Vannan, said—as reported in this week's 	<i>Peeblesshire News</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are returning in this region to pre-war standards, when instead we should be educating children for the millennium."</p></blockquote>
At base, we have an education system in Scotland of which we can be rightly proud; it has achieved much for many generations of Scots. That is why we should build on, not destroy, it. When he came to office, the right hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) said that he would be a listening Secretary of State. Let him listen now—let him listen to the people to whom he talked outside and let him respond to their fears and concerns, and to the concerns of communities across Scotland. He must invest in our schools and in our young people. I ask him not to destroy the life chances of a generation of young Scots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Today's debate is timely as only three days ago my right hon. Friend published "Raising the Standard", our White Paper on education and skills development in Scotland, which sets out the many radical and far-seeing initiatives that we have introduced since 1979 and lists the advantages gained in Scottish education under our stewardship and in wider partnership. The White Paper does much more; it also sets out the steps that we will take in coming years to maintain the momentum that will ensure that progress continues to be made in raising standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper shows how the education world has changed since 1979: information for parents; the parents charter; school boards; independent further education colleges; self-governing schools; standard grade; five-to-14; "Higher Still"; assisted places and many more developments are now firmly part of our educational structure. For the most part, those innovations were fiercely resisted by Opposition Members, but they have proved widely popular and immensely effective. They have all contributed to the dramatic improvement in levels of achievement and participation. For example, the number of nursery school pupils increased by 55 per cent, between 1979–80 and 1995–96 and is set to increase even more dramatically from 1 August. I shall return to that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that the purpose of advertising campaigns is usually to overcome resistance on the part of the consumer. If his scheme for nursery vouchers is so overwhelmingly popular, why is it necessary to advertise it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to discuss the issue of nursery vouchers later; but the hon. and learned Gentleman and his party, along with the Labour party, said the same things when we advertised our "right to buy" policy in the early 1980s, which they fiercely resisted, saying that Scottish people did not want it—yet 300,000 Scots have now proved them wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many more young people stay on in full-time education after the age of 16, the percentage has risen from 60 per cent. in 1980 to 82 per cent in 1994. Examination results have improved: in 1995, 8 per cent. of school leavers left with no SCE qualification; in 1980, the equivalent figure was 31 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total number of students in higher education between 1980 and 1993 increased by some 64 per cent. Everyone who has played a part should be proud of what has been achieved but there is no room for complacency—more improvements are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our programme of change has been guided by a vision of an education system in which schools, colleges, universities and teachers focus on quality and on standard and in which schools and colleges are responsive to the needs of society generally and individuals specifically. It is a system that assures ever-widening opportunity and choice for parents, pupils and students.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is because education authorities are not giving the same priority to education as my right hon. Friend has done. In the last public expenditure round, my right hon. Friend told the Committee that there were three spending priorities: health the fight against crime, and education. We have every right to expect LEAs to make the same hard decisions that we made and prioritise their spending as we have done. The 20,000 parents in Glasgow were right to march because they believe that Glasgow councils are not passing on increases in spending on education as we have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir David Steel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must accept that the increase in Government grant to the council is insufficient to cover the cost of inflation and the extra-statutory responsibilities that the Government have given to local authorities. They are not allowed to increase council tax by more than a modest amount. If Ministers find these cuts as unacceptable as I do, they have an obligation to state what they would do if they were in the councils' position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that the Scottish Office had to prioritise spending, which meant making difficult decisions when examining the entire range of my right hon. Friend's spending block to determine which budgets would receive small increases. That was how we decided our spending priorities and we expect local councils to do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vision remains. The White Paper, "Raising the Standard", gives details about how we shall make improvements in education. Time allows me to identify today only a few of our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our highly successful pre-school voucher scheme will be extended from 1 August 1997. Parents can look forward to application forms being issued on 27 February. Opposition Members have misrepresented the initiative at every turn. They have attacked the way in which it has been managed, its popularity in pilot areas, its convenience, its efficiency, its ability to allow growth in provision and its quality. But on each count those criticisms have been refuted, not by what I have said, but by events. The voucher system is well planned, well structured, and soundly based. A mark of the depth of its planning and the quality of its management has been our concern to iron out potential problems ahead of the new arrangements that will be made nationwide in August. For that reason we have run this year's pilot, covering a wide variety of circumstances, in four areas in the west and north of Scotland. The key test was the issue and redemption of vouchers in the first term, last August. The results show the voucher scheme as a triumph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall remind the Committee of the figures. Ninety-seven per cent, of eligible parents have applied for vouchers. The number of local authority centres has risen from 21 to 63. For the first time, 87 private nurseries and playgroups have had their educational quality endorsed by Her Majesty's inspectorate of schools. The figures make it clear that the pilot scheme has been thorough, successful and effective. They are a tribute to the effectiveness of vouchers, to our management of the initiative and to the commitment of parents and providers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that vouchers are extremely popular. With 97 per cent. of eligible parents applying, the enthusiasm for vouchers is a fact that cannot be shrugged off by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Opposition Members. Vouchers are a convenient way of arranging pre-school education. I have not had one complaint from parents or providers about the mechanics of the voucher system. Scotland's parents do not like to be patronised or told that they are too gormless to use vouchers. They will take such remarks into account when they reflect on the Government's record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue and redemption of vouchers costs less than 1 per cent. of the voucher value. That figure makes one wonder whether many grant schemes could be administered for less. Where is the elaborate bureaucracy of which the Opposition, and in particular the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) spoke when debating the Education (Scotland) Bill in Committee last year? It is in the hon. Lady's imagination, where it always was, and certainly not in real life. Vouchers are efficient and simple to use. The pilot has proved that conclusively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asked where the bureaucracy is. I asked him on 17 December what estimate he has made
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the administrative cost in each local authority area in Scotland of implementing the nursery voucher scheme in the first full year of its operation."</p></blockquote>
He answered:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The operational evaluation of the pilot year voucher schemes which I have commissioned from a research team at Stirling university will look, amongst other things, at impact on providers, including the four piloting authorities, of introducing the voucher system. The research will be published following submission of the research team's final report in early autumn 1997."—	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1996; vol. 287, c.573–74.</p></blockquote>
In short, he does not know. That is another burden for local authorities that no doubt do not have the resources to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat to the hon. Gentleman that the cost of the scheme is less than 1 per cent. and works out at less than £10 per child. I said that clearly and the hon. Gentleman obviously was not listening. The pilots are proving that the vouchers are efficient and simple to use. Moreover, we will respond to the emerging findings of the Stirling evaluation of the pilot year and will continue to be open to suggestions of ways in which to make the system even easier and more convenient for providers and parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister keep on trying to deceive the public about Labour's position north and south of the border? He is now indulging in a crude form of electoral bribery in going ahead with a campaign involving £800,000 of advertising material, in the run up to and, probably, through, a general election, when he knows that that tears into shreds every electoral convention that has been in use until now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The advertising campaign is well within the Butler guidelines. It has been approved by the permanent secretary. If the hon. Gentleman wants to take the matter further he is entitled to do so. He does not want Scottish parents to know that from August this year all parents of pre-school age children will be given £1,100 to spend on the nursery of their choice. That is what we offer. The hon. Gentleman is committed to snatching back that £1,100 while the Labour

party in England has said that it will work with the system that it inherits. The system that would be inherited would be the one that would already be in place. English parents would be given £1,100 by the Government and allowed to keep it. The hon. Gentleman and his party want to snatch that amount from every Scottish parent; that is why he is trying to stop our advertising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister continue to tell the Committee something that is plainly not true? Labour party policy is not as he described it. It is exactly as it is in Scotland. We will abandon the nursery voucher scheme and we will offer in its place—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In year one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In year one, in place of a paper amount of £1,100, we will offer a state-funded nursery place. That is our commitment and pledge. We shall fulfil it this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There we are. The Labour party knows best. There is to be no choice for parents, no flexibility, sensitivity or responsiveness. People will be told, "You will send your child to a state nursery or a place will not be provided." The right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) is on the record as having said that any incoming Labour Government, God forbid, would work with the system that it inherited in England. That would be the voucher system, which commences on 1 April in England. The hon. Member for Hamilton obviously does not realise that. Scotland's voucher system is commencing on 1 August. The hon. Member for Hamilton should get to know what his party in England is saying, or sack his researcher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just heard an intervention from the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson). My hon. Friends will remember the same hon. Gentleman saying in a Scottish Grand Committee a short time ago that there would be no referendum on a Scottish Parliament and no referendum on the tartan tax—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman said that Labour would deliver those within its first year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that point. The growth in provision—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>— </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make some progress as I have only 20 minutes in which to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Growth in provision has given the lie to suggestions that vouchers are a threat to local authority provision, which has, in fact, tripled in the pilot areas. Growth has offered opportunities to voluntary and private sector providers, but the best opportunities have been given to parents. East Renfrewshire, traditionally an area of low provision, can now boast that a place is available for every
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
eligible child; I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) will try to catch your eye on that point, Mr. Maxton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Across the pilot areas as a whole—and although many of them are rural and remote—93 per cent. of parents with vouchers have found the means to use them. That is remarkable growth by any standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality safeguards built into the voucher system mark it out most impressively. Whether they are run by education authorities or the independent sector, schools have long been assessed by Her Majesty's inspectorate. The strides that we have taken to improve quality in schools—such as the adult unit's development of performance indicators—have not been confined to primary and secondary schools, but extended to nursery education too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not bind ourselves with dogma about whether someone is formally qualified as a teacher. What is important is that pre-school education centres should offer genuine, good-quality educational experience along with appropriate curriculum planning and delivery, management, observation and recording, and communication with parents. Many nurseries and schools play a major role in supporting pre-school learning, and we are finding, as we expected, that that can happen equally well in nurseries and playgroups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What matters first, last and always is the quality of children's learning. That is why we have put strict controls in place. Those comprehensive and highly accountable controls ensure that only high quality centres are available for voucher redemption. The standards that we impose are demanding, but the playgroups and private nurseries in the pilot areas have risen to the challenge, magnificently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that we published a timetable for national implementation of the voucher initiative in December 1996.1 shall, this afternoon, launch a publicity campaign to alert parents throughout Scotland to the fact that they will receive voucher application forms at the beginning of next month.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My announcement today will be a further step in the progress of the pre-school education initiative as it moves towards national implementation in August.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the time constraints, Mr. Maxton, and I feel that I must make some progress, but I will give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. He has covered much of the ground on Conservative education policies. When will he respond to the specific debate initiated by my hon. Friends: the interface between Conservative policy and the horrendous financial position of local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps if I am allowed to make some progress, those matters will be covered. I make no apology for dwelling on pre-school vouchers, which are a major development of the education service and are bringing £30 million in new money to education year on year, as the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye should know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall touch now on some other proposals in the White Paper. From April, a £9 million grant scheme on early intervention will be introduced to ensure that children get off to a good start, particularly in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Effective schools should get the credit that they deserve. We should recognise excellence wherever it is found. We have gone a long way to ensure that; my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has asked the inspectorate to propose a grading system that will identify and credit highly effective schools. The system will take account of exam performance, the progress and improvement of ethos, and other things that matter to parents who are trying to identify a good school. I am confident that such accreditation will be highly valued and sought by schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education authorities also have an important role to play in supporting schools' drives to improvement. It is essential that the authorities have satisfactory quality assurance arrangements in place. As with individual schools, such arrangements should be subject to external scrutiny. We will therefore extend the power of Her Majesty's inspectors to cover the quality assurance arrangements of education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of teachers in securing higher levels of achievement is fully recognised in our White Paper. Indeed, they are central to it. We have a high quality teaching profession, and we are committed to its continuation and improvement. Our proposals are designed to improve its status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have already announced, we shall remove the statutory basis of the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee and announce legislative proposals to establish a teachers' pay review body. Teachers are respected members of the community and carry out a highly professional job. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Opposition may scoff at that, but teachers deserve to have their pay professionally determined in the same way as that of doctors, dentists and other professionals. A pay review body will do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Appraisal is at the heart of our attempts to raise the standard of teaching in Scottish schools. The present non-statutory system of appraisal—although well funded—has effectively failed. That is unacceptable. Therefore we shall introduce draft regulations to provide a statutory basis for teacher appraisal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also recently announced moves to improve discipline in Scottish schools through the positive discipline initiative. At our recent highly successful national conference, I said that the White Paper would address the use of home-to-school contracts. That innovation has been generated in today's new atmosphere of co-operative self-regulation and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one principle that remains unchanged in Scottish education—and always will—is that teachers stand in loco parentis. Nothing can replace the paramount influence of parents in a child's personal development. Home-to-school contracts embody that principle because they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
embody a set of rules, governing behaviour, rewards and sanctions. They have been found advantageous in some schools in promoting good discipline. Generally the contracts involve pupils, parents and the school agreeing a set of rights and responsibilities that they undertake to use to guide their approach to day-to-day activities in the school. They are two-way contracts in that they give rights and responsibilities to both pupils and staff. They are also highly individual in that they reflect the specific circumstances of participating schools. The direct participation of parents, teachers and pupils is important to their impact and success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Raising the Standard" can be interpreted in two ways. In its obvious sense, it means improving quality, and that clearly applies to the proposals in the White Paper. However, in Scotland, which has a long tradition of uprisings, "Raising the Standard" also has undertones of rebellion. That is also relevant to Scottish education policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have raised the standard of rebellion against the discredited social engineering of the educational hippies who have never grown out of the delusions of the 1960s. We have raised the standard against socialist dogma and against the repression of intelligent pupils and the discouragement of excellence. We are against the stale, outdated egalitarian obsession of Opposition Members. Since 1979, the Conservative and Unionist Government have been in rebellion against the failed nostrums of trendy educationists and their Opposition supporters. That rebellion is being increasingly joined by Scottish parents as the 97 per cent. uptake of nursery vouchers has signalled despite all the black propaganda from the moaning minnies in the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour is not content with seeking to force Scots to pay income tax at a starting rate that will be 15 per cent. higher than in England. It is now committed to snatching £1,100 out of the hands of every parent with pre-school children in Scotland when English parents will be allowed to keep the vouchers and the money. I will not say that the Labour party is un-Scottish, but it is definitely anti-Scottish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party is the Scottish party. We have made a commitment to restore Scottish education to global pre-eminence. We are doing that through the enlargement of choice, the enhancement of quality and the encouragement of excellence. Opposition Members call us elitist. We most definitely are because we are determined to make the young people of Scotland the elite of their generation—not just in the United Kingdom, but throughout the world.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak in this debate in Selkirk. It has been worth it for the speech that we have just heard. People from the borders are entitled to know why their education system has been allowed to come to such a crisis, and the reason is now clear. The Minister cannot master the debate or answer questions asked not only by the Opposition but by members of the public outside the building and in the hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to be in Selkirk for another reason. I first visited Selkirk in 1970 to join Lady Steel on a demonstration against apartheid. I remember the day
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
clearly because of the decency of the borders people and their commitment to ending discrimination. Many Conservative Members mocked and insulted us at the time. However, the campaign against apartheid was successful, and those who mocked were at the front of the queue to welcome Nelson Mandela, the man whom they had condemned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating a crisis that the Government have manufactured. The education crisis has been caused by mismanagement, lack of understanding and an out-of-touch Government. It is possible to feel compassion for Conservative Members. Opposite us is a group of men who are so out of touch with real people that they try to pull the wool over our eyes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the debate that the Government will propose nothing new today. The Committee met in Kilmarnock recently to discuss last year's expenditure settlement. The Government presented the same arguments then, but on that occasion, the Secretary of State did us the courtesy of addressing the Committee. We can nw reflect on the impact of that expenditure settlement—cuts of £90 million and 1,200 fewer teachers are direct consequences. This year, we face a deeper crisis. There is no fat left on education. That is as clear here in the borders as anywhere else in Scotland. We are cutting education root and branch. Yesterday, we heard that £860,000 is to be used to try to sell a discredited policy. That is shameful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As recently as Friday of last week Professor Sally Brown, the deputy principal of Stirling university, together with her colleagues Lesley Low and Christine Stephen, who are the researchers evaluating the nursery voucher scheme, wrote in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i>:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The pressure on our research group at Stirling University, which has responsibility for the national evaluation of the scheme, to provide information at the earliest possible moment on how things have gone is intense. At this time we have few findings which we can with confidence offer to the public or the politicians; the initiative has been in place for only one term and we have collected limited data."</p></blockquote>
That is a shameful—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way? She has accused me of misleading the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. Once again she shows that she is to nursery education what Cruella de Vil was to puppy walking. She should not quote sections of a report which she has not seen. That report goes on to show that the researchers found that the general reaction from both parents and providers of the voucher system has been positive. Parents found the application form easy to complete, and providers felt that completion of the profile of education was fair and necessary. There was a general perception of a demand for increased quality places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall prove that I can read as well as the Minister. The TES report specifically states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have concentrated in our preliminary analysis on what might be called 'operational matters' because that has been the Scottish Office's priority. Many other aspects of our research still have to be explored."</p></blockquote>
The authors go on to state that they are not authorised to examine quality. Only last year the Government told us that there was no need for teachers in nursery schools. That is deplorable. Perhaps I may return to the issue of the quality of education in the borders and the threat of cuts—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I gladly give way to the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions that arise from what the hon. Lady has said. First, is she saying a Labour Government would take the nursery vouchers away from parents in England who received them in April? She seemed to be saying that and I do not think that that is the Labour party's position. If she tells the Committee that it is it will be an interesting development. Secondly, was she saying that—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

point that I was in the process of making. In relation to the cuts that are likely to be experienced here in the borders—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked a perfectly straightforward question. If there were a labour Government, would parents in England have vouchers next year while parents in Scotland would not? That is a simple question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parents in England and Scotland would have nursery places. A voucher is a piece of paper: it is not a nursery place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the advertising campaign. It has cost £860,000 which as the Under-Secretary of State said is 1/4000th of the Scottish Office budget. It is almost exactly the amount that the Minister has said will be available for special needs education in nursery schools. Advertising has been put on a par with special needs education. We have heard about instrumental music tuition in the borders. It would cost £260,000 to save that, yet today we have heard about an advertising campaign costing £860,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other cuts will have a significant effect on the borders. Many young people have lobbied this Committee because one prospective cut would mean the end of some courses for the certificate of sixth-year studies. The certificate is not a nice add-on to take up in the sixth year. Many pupils who wish to study veterinary medicine, dentistry or general medicine will find that they cannot get into universities such as Edinburgh, which expect six-year studies in addition to highers. The future of children throughout Scotland, not just in the borders, will be cut off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Last week, another tawdry document of blatant pre-election propaganda was published to try to justify Conservative education policy. The publication cost £8.50—exactly the same as a secondary school maths book. That shows this Government's priorities. Everything is show and nothing is substance. We are debating an issue of critical importance in the upcoming general election. If Conservative Members were to win that election there would be not just nursery vouchers, but vouchers in primary and secondary schools, because the Secretary of State has already set out his plans for vouchers for primary and secondary education. It is a shameful indictment of anyone who claims to have the interests of the Scottish people at heart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that in addition to the vouchers for nursery education and for post-16 school leavers, we would introduce in the next Parliament vouchers for primary schools. That is completely untrue and I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have absolutely no intention of withdrawing it. In 1988, the right hon. Gentleman and his colleague, now the Secretary of State for Defence, the right hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo)—that is an interesting combination—in a document entitled "Save our Schools", wrote:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"While the …ordinary state schools would be of such a level as to ensure an acceptable minimum standard of education for all children, parents seeking a more expensive education would be able to add their own money to the voucher to pay higher fees."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education for the few, not for the many. Their shameful advertising campaign highlights members of a Government who have now lost self respect. If they are grovelling so deeply into the gutters of politics that they try to use taxpayers' money in the run-up to a general election, they should go, and go now. There are few people in this Hall and elsewhere who would be opposed to their going. Enough is enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: was slightly puzzled as to why the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) did not allow me to intervene in the debate. I wanted to make a serious point. The hon.

shadow Chancellor has said that there will be no spending increases in an incoming Labour Government's budget. The nursery vouchers scheme offered by this Government is for partial nursery education at this stage. Where would the hon. Lady find the additional money to fund that nursery education scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. In the document "Raising the Standard", the Government state that £30 million of new money will be available for nursery education; but £1.5 million of that will have to go to a private management company. Several local authorities already have provision for four-year-olds because of the commitments of Labour-controlled local authorities. In the medium term, we would seek to extend that provision to every four-year-old, and in the longer-term to three-year-olds. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should do his research a little better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other day in the House it was suggested that I should do my research a little better when I told Opposition Members that this Government had introduced measures to control football hooliganism. I was told that a Labour Member had introduced the measure, but that was wrong. Labour Members who were in the Chamber accused me of not doing my homework, but they had voted against the measure. Their memories are very short; they live in a befuddled world, not knowing their policies, which change from day to day. I challenge the hon. Lady again to tell us how much her scheme will cost per head, per child next year. There will not be enough in the present budget allocation to meet the cost. If she can give details, I will give way to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the opportunity to expound Labour party policy. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not hear me when I said earlier that £30 million of new money is allegedly available for nursery vouchers. Already, local authorities are providing places for four-year-olds. The Under-Secretary did not mention that Labour's plans involve a partnership between the public, the private and the voluntary sector and the voluntary sector is of significant importance in rural communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has still not answered the question. The difference between the hon. Lady and the Liberal Democrats is that they are honest about their education programme. They say that they would inject £130 million into education by means of 1p in the pound income tax. The hon. Lady and her hon. Friends do not have the courage to say that and their promises are therefore worthless.

The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred to the empty seats alongside me at the beginning of the debate. Prior to the previous general election, there were even more empty seats. We closed the gap marginally; after the next general election we will fill up one or two more. I would like to think that we will fill up one or two more seats here in the borders, as we already have a couple of excellent prospective parliamentary candidates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been declarations of education spending priorities from all parties. Whichever party is the party of government, it will have very little extra cash to play with. It is a case of changing our current budget expenditure proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) raised a good point about aggregate external finance against the background of the formula that determines how much Scotland spends. In considering priorities, choice in Scotland must come down to issues such as transport, infrastructure, development and social welfare. I would respect the Opposition a bit more if they said whether they would take cash from those budgets to inject it into education. It is strange that in different debates we have heard Opposition Members making pledges to increase expenditure in all those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of only one area of national expenditure in which they have not determined to spend more: defence. I challenge all Labour Members here to say whether a Labour Government would make a commitment to maintain the existing levels of defence expenditure. Would any of them care to comment on that? Will any of them say that the Labour party will not cut defence expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that today's debate is about local authorities and expenditure. Defence is not a local authority responsibility. Will he stop preventing us from discussing what is happening to education in the borders and get back to the subject of the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should tell the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) that defence has nothing to do with today's debate. Nor is it the done thing to invite people to intervene in a speech. It is up to them to do so, not for him to invite them to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I shall not extend another such invitation. Without challenging the view from the Chair, I shall return to the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson). Spending is an integrated thing: what we spend on local government, health or anything else forms part of a fine balance. Defence contributes to that balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan has a particular defence interest in his constituency; if we find that Scotland will lose jobs because of cuts in defence expenditure, spending in social security will go up, all of which leaves less for education. That was the point that I was trying to make, and it is an important point for my constituents and for the local economy of Ayrshire, which depends on commercial and industrial involvement. The more there is, the more cash comes to local government and the more we can spend on education. We all have to consider that. There is a balance, and we have to get it right. The Opposition have legitimate arguments, which we must consider honestly and then put forward alternatives, rather than—as the hon. Member for Monklands, East should note—a smokescreen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
I want to discuss a couple of issues. The hon. Member for Govan asked me to return to education. The Government have a proud record on education. Since 1979 the ratio of pupils to teachers has been improved. Expenditure on primary school pupils has been raised by 50 per cent. per head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Across Scotland, circumstances in education have changed: there has been a bulge, but school rolls are now declining. It is becoming ever more important for local authorities to manage education reasonably. But, right across Scotland, we are finding authorities giving a higher priority to maintaining—poorly—a range of school buildings, rather than addressing the problem of falling school rolls. We have lost opportunities, and we must address the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through primary testing, we have improved standards in our schools. I pay tribute to teachers; perhaps they have stepped back from some of the sillier ideas that modern educationalists of the 1960s and 1970s adopted as ideals, when they moved away from traditional values. We are moving back to those values and I welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the changes that the Government have made over the years in the set-up of our secondary examinations system. They have proved beneficial. More youngsters are leaving secondary education well educated and with qualifications much higher than in 1979 and before. Conservatives take pride in those achievements. We also take pride in the number of children who go to university. One in four Scottish children go to university now; and that did not happen when I was young. I did not have the privilege of a university education, although I do not bemoan that as I had a brilliant manual apprenticeship in the dockyards, of which I am proud. But I should have liked to have the chance of going to university because that shows in such a polished fashion in some Opposition Members. Children today have that chance and they have Conservative government of the past 20 years to thank for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nursery vouchers are important to many of my constituents. At the last elections, I pledged to do what I could to persuade the Government to provide nursery education for four-year-olds, and vouchers are a step towards that. Oppositon Members moan and groan that £800,000 will be provided to spread the word on that scheme and ensure that people understand it. There is nothing wrong with such expenditure. I have been convinced of that not by my hon. Friends, but by Opposition Members. Members of local authorities have convinced me that it was right for them to put out information on local authority services in newspapers passed through every door within their areas. That is not advertising or politicking; it is passing information to those who elected us. The Government intend to inform people accurately of their entitlements. We do that in the context of social work and social security, so why should not we do it on the important issue of education? My right hon. and hon. Friends are absolutely right and I commend them for it. I wish that the Opposition would stop nit-picking; it demeans them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assisted places scheme is another important aspect of Government policy. Much derision is poured on it by the Opposition but I have had letters from two constituents who are single parents with clever children who want to work. They went to secondary schools where those around them demeaned their efforts. The children were derided, given a hard time. Their peers did not want
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
swots and made their lives a misery. One 13-year-old felt so bad that she thought she should opt out of school but she was fortunate enough to get one of the Government's assisted places and that has turned an educational nightmare into a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the country many such 12-year-olds are looking for such opportunities. The Government should stick with the scheme because it is a service that people admire and require. Once again, I make the point that my comments on education come from someone who spent time in the state education system—at primary school and Dumfermline high school. That person did not benefit from public school education as did many Opposition Members, yet the latter now deny that opportunity for others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education has been devolved to the local authorities. It is their responsibility to deliver. They know what funds they have and know what objectives they wish to achieve. Local authority councillors have taken on a job; just as in private business and other parts of the public sector, they are working under budgetary constraints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) opened the debate by telling us of public servants in local government writing to the local press to say how sorely stretched their funds are. Those people have a job to do; they would not find others in business, in either the private or the public sector, bemoaning their lot in such a way. If the fire is too hot for them, they should get out of it and do something else. Let those who can deliver provide the educational service that our children deserve—within reasonably set budgetary provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) went on about the great advantages of the assisted places scheme and private education. As one who has had experience of the English private education system, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that it did not do me much good; it cannot have done him much good either. Far better that we should invest in the mainstream public education system. That is where our responsibility lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency of East Lothian is 18 miles as the crow flies from Selkirk, but it is a whole world away in terms of local authority services. Labour-controlled East Lothian council has fought tooth and claw and with considerable ingenuity over the years to maintain tolerable standards and a tolerable level of funding for local services. However, in the borders, under a series of pseudo-Tory administrations, councils have been running a low-budget strategy, and sadly, the present authority in East Lothian is now paying the price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the East Lothian council and its predecessors, and to their education staff, for trying to provide for the needs of our growing population. After a long campaign, a fine new primary school was opened in the Stoney Hill area of Musselburgh. My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) performed the official opening of the school. That shows what can be done by a committed local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
East Lothian district council managed to set aside £8 million from capital receipts to invest in the refurbishment and repair of schools throughout my constituency. I have been delighted to help as a trustee of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
the East Lothian Community Development Trust. Of course, East Lothian has benefited from the previous Lothian region's commitment to nursery education. Nevertheless, despite that good news, the Government have this year imposed a cut of £1.1 million in education spending in East Lothian. That will obviously hurt, but our councillors have undertaken to safeguard frontline educational services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know exactly what this silly Minister is going to say. He will suggest that East Lothian has had an increase of allocation. That is not true in real terms, because the growth allowed for by the Scottish Office does not cover the increased costs that it has imposed on local authorities—and he knows it. I shall not give way to him, because Tory members have wasted quite enough time already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making the best of a difficult job in East Lothian, but the situation in other parts of Scotland is far worse, particularly here in the borders. I know a little about the borders, having lived here all my life. I was Member of Parliament for Berwick and East Lothian for five years and I am the father of two children presently being educated at Berwickshire high school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the borders authorities have traditionally followed a low-budget strategy, and given the obvious difficulties in delivering services in such a sparsely populated area, teachers and education staff have done remarkably well over the years. It is a shoestring operation, but they have done well under the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an illustration of the problems of delivering education services in such an area. Each of my two sons will have travelled 43,000 miles on school buses by the end of their school careers. That represents a substantial cost before they even reach the school gate. As with many borders children, they were in composite classes throughout their primary education in a Berwickshire village school. The education service here starts with several inherent handicaps, but this year the Scottish Office capping limit is driving local services in general, and the education service in particular, right through the pain threshold. It is impossible to cut £3.8 million from the education budget in the borders without doing serious damage to the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My wife is a councillor for a ward in Berwickshire and, over the past few weekends, I have been getting a flavour of her constituency mail and telephone calls. People are appalled at the options that the council is being forced to contemplate to comply with the Government's capping limit. That has been shown again from the demonstrations outside the gates of this building this morning. There is a threat of wholesale amalgamations for rural primary schools; the complete withdrawal from primary schools; of visiting music, art and PE teachers; drastic cuts in secondary schools; a clampdown on what little nursery provision there is and a threat of mothballing for school swimming pools. On the last point, I remember taking my sons to their life-saving courses at a swimming pool at Berwickshire high school and I fear seriously that the loss of that facility, which is now under threat, will increase
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
the risk of drowning for youngsters in the borders. That aspect of physical education is not a luxury and it should not be dispensed with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of months ago, the Secretary of State for Scotland visited the borders to spend a part of his little slush fund of £62,000 on ceremonies for the return of the stone of destiny, including a parade on Coldstream bridge, which is not far from where I live. What about the destiny of our children in the borders? Surely that is more important than a piece of stone. That piece of stone is not a substitute for the education of people in the borders and elsewhere in Scotland. It is diabolical cheek for Tory Ministers to issue a White Paper on education entitled "Raising the Standard" when they are deliberately imposing cuts or resources for education. The Secretary of State shakes his head, but surely even he can add up and understand that the decisions that he has taken this year are damaging education standards in Scotland, not raising them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is not a single council that is not receiving an extra allocation this year. In the provision for spending, we have provided for a 2 per cent. increase in education. I agree with what the hon. Gentleman said about withdrawing the provision of music tuition and so on. No such decisions have been taken and it would be disgraceful if such decisions were made. He and I are members of different parties, but both parties agree that the pot cannot be increased. Is he not just playing to the gallery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. In real terms, the pot is being decreased and the Government are wasting money on the sort of things about which my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) was talking. There are better ways of managing the budget; there are certainly fairer ways of administering things than that which the Secretary of State is adopting at the moment. I am not remotely surprised that people in the borders and elsewhere in Scotland are bitter and angry. They are right to be so. I share their sense of anger, but I urge people in the borders to continue to focus their anger constructively as they have done this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Borders council, which was elected in 1985 and which took over its responsibilities only last year, is obviously not responsible for this nightmare. It is caught between a legacy of underspending and an outrageous capping limit set by this Tory Secretary of State. It would be phenomenally silly to blame convener Drew Tulley and the Scottish Borders council for a crisis that is manifestly not of their making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read the local press here, and I see the effects of the whispering campaign to make the council the scapegoat for the Government's policies—the Secretary of State

tried to do so again just now. The council is trying to safeguard services while the Government keep imposing legislation that wastes money on cosmetic decentralisation schemes, nursery vouchers, opting out, assisted places at private schools and all the rest of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For what it is worth, my advise to fellow borderers is to stop sniping at their own council and to focus attention on the real culprit. Do not just get angry, get even. That means getting behind Drew Tulley and the Scottish borders council and helping us to get rid of this Tory Administration at the Scottish Office at the coming election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A change of Government will make a real difference, especially in education. We know that a new Labour Government will inherit a financial shambles, but we will have some room for manoeuvre. We will be able to do away with the expensive opt-out scheme, which we have already discussed, with the wasteful nursery voucher scheme and the £850,000 publicity stunt that goes with it, and with the £10 million assisted places scheme for private schools. As a private school survivor, I hope that we will go one step further and impose value added tax on private schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will also be able to relax the cap on local authority budgets, especially for education. Labour specifically promises to cut class sizes in primary schools, to expand nursery education and to help to raise teaching standards, and we are determined to restore a framework of partnership and co-operation with local authorities. Education is the real stone of destiny for the future of Scotland, and we should be building on it. There are millions of good reasons to dump this discredited Tory Government, but their onslaught on education in areas such as the orders must be the ultimate insult, they must go, and the sooner the better. The people of the borders can help in that process by electing Keith Geddes and Helen Eadie as their Members of Parliament at the coming election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The booing made it easy to know when the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) arrived by ministerial car this morning. It was loud enough, but the barometer rose massively when the Secretary of State arrived. The people know who is to blame for all the cuts and closures in Scotland. In this small, doose burgh, there was a massive show of public anger this morning against the Government and their policies and the effect that those policies are having on the everyday services provided by our national local government system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tory Government's war on Scottish local authorities in damaging the Scottish economy, causing unemployment and hitting the small business sector. It threatens essential daily services for people throughout the length and breadth of the country. Over the next two years, the Tory financial settlement—now accepted by Labour—will destroy about 17,000 jobs and take about £315 million out of the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland are paying dearly for Tory dogma against local authorities. It could have been so different. Instead of attacking democratically-elected
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
Scottish local Government, we should be playing to its strengths and providing top-quality, dependable local services at low cost and under local, democratic control. The professional, experienced teams in local authorities should be the basis for a war on poor Scottish housing conditions and for environmental and infrastructure improvements, as well as for the provision of a Scottish educational system to launch us into the 21st century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Damage to Scottish local government damages the whole Scottish economy. The Government stand indicted of incompetence driven by their dogma. I want a properly resourced local authority system providing high-quality services to the Scottish people and raising standards within this country. When the Government want to find money to finance projects, they seem to find it without difficulty. It is a great irony that this Tory Government propose to spend £800,000 on a propaganda campaign to promote their nursery voucher scheme, given that young qualified teachers cannot find employment, that teachers seeking early retirement cannot receive it and that school buildings are badly in need of refurbishment. That £800,000 would have been better spent in Scottish classrooms. It is time that the Government changed their priorities and provided proper resources, instead of funding a propaganda campaign—a last throw of the dice by a dying, played-out minority government in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A little less than a year ago I secured an Adjournment debate on education in Scotland. As so far today, we had at that time a full and constructive debate in which the Government's failures were clearly laid bare. What was obvious then, in a week in which 40,000 parents and teachers marched through the streets of Edinburgh to protest at cuts in education, was that Scottish education faced a crisis. Eleven months on, the crisis has deepened, with 20,000 parents and teachers marching in Glasgow to protest against the Government's failures to meet education needs. We have seen today's events here in Selkirk. Fortunately all the people of Scotland will soon have an opportunity at the ballot box to bring the Government to account. They can hide but they cannot shirk their ultimate responsibility: these are their policies, their cuts and their budgets that are being imposed on the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are a year into drastic cuts in local government budgets. As the largest local government service, education has taken a massive hit. There is a real possibility of strike action by our committed teaching profession. Teachers do not want to strike but they are telling us that they find the Government's policies and cuts unacceptable. The Government's sole, sorry response has been a White Paper that is high on gimmicks but short on the new funding that is so desperately needed for education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will have followed with interest and, no doubt, growing concern, the reports of action that local authorities may be forced to take to fill the gap in Government funding. It is likely that next year there will be fewer schools and teachers, and larger class sizes. There will certainly be less choice and a cut in extra-curricular opportunities for schoolchildren. There may even be an end to hot school meals in at least one authority's schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland is well known for his admiration of Lady Thatcher, a trait that apparently he shares with the Leader of the Opposition. The right hon. Gentleman, it must be said, attempts to emulate the iron
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
lady but, as his latest swingeing local government cuts take effect, he has managed to outdo his mentor. First there was Thatcher the milk snatcher, who removed free school milk; now there is Michael the school meal bandit. This time the pupil has learnt the wrong lesson. Each time a school closes, or a teacher loses his or her job, or a pupil goes without a hot school meal, we are seeing the direct result of the Tory Government's attack on Scottish local government. I am delighted that every Scottish National party-controlled local authority has pledged to work to protect local authorities from the full impact of the Tory cuts and will not close any schools in our authority areas or sack teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are deceitful in their attempt to peddle the myth that they have increased expenditure on local government. The Scottish people will read the figures, but they know full well that they can never believe a Tory when he talks about tax and spending. The Government claim that they have increased expenditure by £130 million; the reality is a cut of £114 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to SNP-run councils. How can he hypothesise about cuts when Angus council has been permitted to increase expenditure by 3.34 per cent. and, according to newspaper reports, seems to want to budget increase of 17.3 per cent. when inflation is 2 to 2.5 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government took £9 million from the Angus economy over mismatch, when, even according to their own figures, that should have gone to Angus for services. If that had happened, Angus council could have had the lowest council tax rating in Scotland. The Government are causing problems with another £6 million hit that will affect small businesses and cause unemployment. They have a great deal to answer for. The convener of education in Angus has to face the problems created by a £1 million cut in his budget. In spite of that, Angus has managed to provide and maintain decent services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not necessary for me to repeat all the twists and turns of the Government's creative accounting. An outline will serve the same purpose. The snake oil salesman has been at it again. The Government have overestimated savings from their botched reorganisation and they have failed to fund adequately the new burdens created by care in the community, by the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 and by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, the Government have failed to find funds for the centrally negotiated pay rise. For the fourth consecutive year, local authorities will have to fund the pay rises, which have been imposed upon them by an outside body, from so-called internal savings. There is no way that they can do that without hitting their budgets. The Government are forcing councils to eat into their savings and reserves—where they now exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sum of those failings is the most severe and sustained financial crisis ever faced by Scottish local government. The reaction of Ministers shows clearly that they do not understand that. Therefore, they should have listened to the people when they entered the Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of creative accounting, will the hon. Gentleman confirm that, as result of underestimating the income that it received from elderly people, Angus council overcharged them from their meals-on-wheels services? It has had to grant them two months' holiday because of the extra income it has received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the Secretary of State is wrong. He does not understand what is happening in local government. Angus council's social workers made contacts to find out what benefits people were entitled to. People claimed the benefits, and that led to savings. Because of the Government rules, the council was not allowed to spend those savings as part of next year's budget. Therefore, it granted a two months' holiday in payment for meals on wheels and for home helps. In addition, the SNP-controlled Angus council will charge nothing for lunch clubs in February and March because the Government have failed to provide a decent cold-climate allowance. That SNP—controlled council provides sustenance and warmth to its old folk and to other groups at risk. The Secretary of State should be ashamed of himself for not only misunderstanding local government, but for failing to appreciate a good local authority when he sees one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tory party has embarked on an ideological and anti-democratic mission to dismember local government in Scotland. Our great tradition of local councils providing democratic services is to be replaced by emasculated bodies whose only purpose is to agree contracts for privatised local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The roots of the Government's education plan are clear. I want to hear the Secretary of State deny that he supports the extension of vouchers from nursery into secondary schooling. That was his policy in the past. If his policies are in line with mad Michael's declaration of Arbroath, it is no wonder that we get such rubbish from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy affects the top and bottom of the education system. The policy involves "pay-as-you-learn universities" and nursery vouchers. The Tories want to squeeze the lifeblood out of the state comprehensive education system that has served Scotland so well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish local government is being forced into a corner by the Tories. It has little room for manoeuvre. The people of Scotland know that each and every cut is the direct result of the Government's financial settlement and that the cuts will have a direct personal impact. What is most distressing for parents and for those who have been involved in local government and in education is the fact that the teaching profession is giving its all to compensate for the cuts when there is only so much that teachers can given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tories have already burdened teachers with a decade of change and with endless form-filling. Therefore, teachers' energies have been directed from classroom teaching. Tory policies have resulted in larger classes, increased teacher strain and decay in the fabric of many schools. There is only so much the teaching profession can do to protect our children's education in the face of that onslaught. Mr. Fred Forrester, the deputy-general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, was reported in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> as saying:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have struggled for several years now to maintain standards while cuts have been made. We have seen class sizes go up and teachers have tried harder and we are still getting good results. But I'm very fearful that is coming to an end—there is a limit to that…I fear that in due course the effect"—</p></blockquote>
of the cuts—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be seen in achievement."</p></blockquote>
That is what the professionals tell the Government—it is time the Government listened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland cannot afford anything less than the best education for our children. However, the opposite threatens to be the Tory legacy, and the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) accepts it. He offers Scottish local government two more years of the same if the Labour party forms a Government. The only new finance for Scotland's schools would be money reallocated from the assisted places scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When preparing the Scottish National party's budgetary documents, we realised that the savings from phasing out the assisted places scheme—a policy that we support— were so insignificant that they were not worth including in our final figures. Yet that insignificant amount is all that new Labour can offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell), who is the Labour education spokesperson, staunchly defended her party's figures. She claimed that its policies had been independently costed. She should send her independent analyst back to school. I shall explain the shortcomings of the Labour party's policy as simply as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assisted places scheme currently costs about £12.5 million for 3,457 pupils in Scotland. I am sure that the hon. Lady will not deny that figure. The cost per pupil is £3,637. But not all the money would be saved. There would be subsequent costs to the state of £1,440 a pupil. Therefore, using simple subtraction, the saving would be £2,197 per pupil, or, using multiplication, £7.6 million in total; but only if the system were scrapped overnight. However, Labour plans to phase it out. Therefore, in the first year of a Labour Administration, the only new money would be a paltry £1.5 million from the assisted places scheme. That would have to be spread throughout the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means: new Labour, no new money; or new Labour, only 70 new teachers—fewer than one per constituency. The figure of £1.5 million is only 0.075 per cent.—less than one thousandth—of local authority education budgets. It will not go far towards reducing class sizes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Labour Government would thus make no difference to the people of Scotland. It would mean two more years of Tory-style cuts and the further destruction of local authorities and our education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP's position is clear. We do not accept Tory spending figures. We will increase funding for local government and education. The Government admit that, for the past 18 years, Scotland has subsidised the rest of the United Kingdom by £27 billion. The real figure is more than double that. All that money has been lost while our services have suffered and the fabric of our schools has deteriorated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the next five years, we will subsidise the rest of the United Kingdom through a further £12.5 billion. I use Government figures as the basis for that statement. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
Labour and Conservative parties will maintain the Union, which drains resources from Scotland. While we pay for the United Kingdom, further drastic cuts will be made at home. Only the SNP proposes to use Scotland's taxes and resources to right Scotland's wrongs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first four years of independence, we will invest an extra £350 million in Scottish education. That will create 700 new teaching posts, repair crumbling schools and provide a free nursery place for every three or four-year-old child whose parents want one. For Selkirk and the Scottish Borders council, that would mean an extra £1.82 million a year for education. That is more for the Scottish borders than Labour would offer the whole of Scotland. The Labour party still wants us to pay the price of the Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education and local government have not been safe in Tory hands. New Labour, led by the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), offers nothing new and nothing different. The tartan Tories offer Scotland the same old Conservative medicine. Only the SNP can be guaranteed to put Scotland first and offer the best for Scottish education.

This is yet another example of how the Labour party is trying to con people about what its policies mean.

I stand here as a humble seeker after truth. The hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) has temporarily left the chamber. Of course, I do not criticise her for that in any way. I can see her hon. Friend's listening to the questions which they will put to her on her return and demand an answer by one o'clock. I asked her a simple question. What would an incoming Labour Government do about local government finance in Scotland? Is not that a simple question?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members claim they will be in power in a few weeks' time. I listened intently to the hon. lady's entire speech. I was not enlightened. I looked around me at hon. Ms on both sides. They were not enlightened either. Unenlightenment was universal. Did she say how AEF would be changed? No. Did she say how the capping limits would be changed? No, she said not a word about that; it was a lot of hot air and general abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was nothing at all about what a Labour Government would do. That was not wholly unexpected as we had the famous meeting between the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) and the Labour leaders. St. George went in on his white horse and told them to get on their bikes as there would be no money and no change. Let us be clear that that is the Labour party policy

in Scotland. The Labour party would not change in one iota the policy of the existing Government on the key questions that were raised.

I make no complaint about the settlement for my area of East Renfrewshire. The distribution formula is decided wholly objectively and honestly. That is obviously true because East Renfrewshire came with the biggest increase on mainland Scotland of 4.96 per cent. Why do not the Opposition Members who complained about vouchers come to East Renfrewshire? We are under Labour Strathclyde, under which legitimate complaints used to be made throughout my constituency about the absence of nursery places. Now under the voucher scheme everyone who wants a place has a place. This authority is run by the Labour party. Decent, honest Labour people are putting the interests of their communities first and creating the partnership that they talk about.

Members, I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel), who was elected, as has been said, some 32 years ago. I was there when he was elected on a wave of anti-Tory fervour. People wanted to ensure that the Tories were defeated, so they voted Liberal thinking that that was the way to ensure that Tories did not get elected in the Borders. In every election since, people—even those who want a Labour Government—have voted Liberal to keep the Tories out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, with boundary changes and the addition of Penicuilk, I look forward to this seat being a Labour gain at the next election. It will only be with the election of a Labour Member of Parliament and a Labour Government that the Borders will get the sort of resources that the area requires. A Member of Parliament who has the Government's ear will be able to do far more for the Borders than one who is in opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was bom, brought up and educated in the Borders. I was educated in Jedburgh grammar and Galashiels academy and my interest in politics was generated by Margaret Hilton, a modern studies teacher at Galashiels academy. I tell pupils who may be listening to today's debate that they should be paying attention to their teachers and sticking in at school; otherwise they may end up becoming Tories and then they will be sorry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not the only member of the Committee who was educated in the borders. I am happy to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths), who unfortunately has had to leave the Committee, was educated at Hawick high school. Happily for us, he is not one of those who takes the view that a day out of Hawick is a day wasted. He has been willing to travel elsewhere and help carry Labour's banner in Parliament—and a very good job he does. I look forward to seeing more people who have been educated in the borders joining us in Parliament. In particular, I look forward to Keith Geddes joining me on the Labour Benches—on the Government side—in the House of Commons.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your flexibility, Mr. Maxton. Were the people demonstrating outside the Committee saying that everything is fine in the borders, that education is excellent and that they support the Government? Or were they saying that things are getting worse and that everything is unsatisfactory? Perhaps I was not reading the posters properly, but I thought that they were saying that they were not happy with services in the borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a series of Conservative speeches and interventions that reek of complacency. Conservative Members are saying that it is all the council's fault. They are unwilling to take responsibility for their actions. We

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
have to remember that dogs bark, cats miaow and Tories try to blame someone else. People in the borders know whom to blame for cuts in education and local government services. They know that the Government can always find money for the projects in which the Government are especially interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can well understand why people in the borders and in other parts of the country are upset what is happening in local government and education. They see that my generation is the first to be genuinely worried that educational provision for our children will be worse than the provision that we received. Cuts in education are applied across the board, which will clearly result in a deterioration in the life chances of children going through the system now. I know that I would never have got to university had it not been for the education service in the borders at the time, or the amount of student grant that I received. That ladder of opportunity is being pulled up by the Tories in a way that will result in fewer working class people from relatively modest backgrounds having the same opportunities as I had. I very much regret that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been considerable coverage of what is happening in the borders, but it is not the only area being adversely affected. In my constituency in Glasgow, there will be a loss of 120 teaching posts in primary schools; 127 teaching posts in secondary schools; and 53 teaching posts in special schools. There will be cuts in higher school bursaries and in transport to primary and secondary schools, and clothing grants for the very poorest of our children will be reduced in value. There will be cuts in technician support, education support services, attendance officers, outdoor education, the hospital tuition service, psychological services and the supplies budget for both primary and secondary schools. There will be cuts, too, in the special needs sector and in community and residential education. There will have to be a special education needs review to save money. That is not a signal to local authorities to improve education for youngsters in their areas. The education service will be decimated, so the life chances of the youngsters under their care will be worse than they were before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those listening to the debate will not have heard the Government seriously answering the charges levelled at them by the hon. Members who spoke earlier. The Government have asked the Opposition what they would do and are not prepared to take responsibility for their own actions. To listen to them, one would think that they had not been the Government for the past 18 years and that the crisis in local government and education had nothing whatever to do with them. That is deplorable, and I am glad that the vast majority of people in Scotland are fully aware of where the responsibility for the difficulties in the system lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that things are ideal now. I believe that there have to be changes in the education service in Scotland. New Labour has said that it would operate a system of fairness, not favours, and that is what we should be doing. There should be more resources put in to education, and I believe that Labour Front Benchers think that too. There is however, scope for disagreement about how much more resources there should be, and I recognise that our views on that may diverge. I should like to see more; that is one of my major priorities. However, that does not mean that there should not be some changes in the education service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
A school in my area has a head teacher, a deputy head teacher, two assistant head teachers, 15 principal teachers—heads of department—and 11 assistant principal teachers. At the bottom of that hierarchy and bureaucracy there is a single teacher. Such a ratio of chiefs to indians does not seem appropriate. That requires review and priorities need to be reoriented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education system has been producer dominated for far too long. The bureaucracy and paper work that have been generated in the system place great burdens on many front-line staff; it is a self-serving system which is insufficiently corrected by those outwith the education profession. What other service has the equivalent of in-service days where the school turns away all its clients and is inward looking? If education is so good, why are schools shut for half the year? Youngsters ought to be getting more of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want finally to address the Government's proposal to abolish the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee. Having been a chairman of that organisation, I completely support the proposal to abolish it in its present form. As I thought when I chaired it, its statutory basis ought to be changed. However, the difficulty about a pay review body is that we must ensure that is considers not only pay but conditions, staffing structures and so on. There also has to be a clear connection between those who make decisions about salary and conditions and those who do the funding. That is why the role of local authorities in a successor to the SJNC is essential. There is no point in having a group of wise men or women setting salary levels and conditions for teaching staff which local authorities cannot afford to fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a Labour Government next meet in Selkirk, they will need the expertise of someone who, like myself, has been a chair of or involved in COSLA. I look forward to the seat being a Labour gain and I and my colleagues look forward to welcoming Keith Geddes to the House of Commons after the next election, and having him lead for education in a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It was an example of excellent journalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three succinct questions, two of which are addressed to the Minister. First, what is being done about instrumental teaching? Music is central, not peripheral, to the curriculum and there is a strong argument that a musical education makes people more co-operative in later life. The Swiss research on that is fascinating. Secondly, what is being done about outdoor education? West Lothian education authority is extremely concerned about having to bring to an end the excellent work done at Lagganlia and other camps. People have asked whether that work can be ring fenced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question is one that the Secretary of State should answer by letter, because it would be unreasonable to expect him to do so off the top of his head. We face the imminent closure of Edinburgh university's sleep laboratory, which is partly funded by Lothian region. That closure is literally a matter of life and death. Three constituents, to my certain knowledge—and other hon.

Members will know of other examples—suffer if they cannot get the treatment they need for a condition called sleep apnoea, in which the throat narrows when the muscles are relaxed. Professor Neil Douglas says that the nearest place where such conditions can be treated after the laboratory is closed will be in Manchester. Could the Scottish Office examine carefully the proposed closure in March 1997? I hope that when he sees the papers, the Secretary of State will reconsider that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will listen carefully to the Minister's winding-up speech because what he says will have a tremendous local impact. The question I wish to ask him was crystallised by my right hon. Friend the Member of Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) who asked about the cuts being unacceptable. The Secretary of State has been forthright about the educational aspects of some of the cuts; but what would the Government do if they were in the position of Scottish Borders councillors? If we do not get an answer to that question, the debate will have failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were given the opportunity to come to Selkirk to look at the difficulties facing Scottish Borders council and to try to give local people some hope. Selkirk is known for bannocks, not for protests in the streets. The Minister and the Secretary of State were good enough to speak to some of the people, although they did not persuade them, but people of the region want to know exactly what the Government have in store for them in the coming three years. There is a tremendous sense of anger, frustration and outrage at what is in prospect for the region in terms of public sector and public service cuts next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is impossible in 10 minutes to give an exhaustive list of the catastrophic cuts that we face. Primary schools are just one area that will be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seven primary schools are at grave risk from the expenditure cuts that Scottish Borders council feels it has to make. However, I wish to concentrate not on the primary schools that will be cut, but on those that will be left. The current cost per primary school pupil per annum is already £60 less than the national average, before the proposed 8 per cent. cut. If the local authority is given no extra flexibility or resources, all primary pupils will in future be deprived of an opportunity for instrumental music instruction. Last year they had to pay £76 a year for that—a charge that was imposed for the first time—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
but in future they will be deprived of the opportunity to develop fully in music, and also in art, physical education and drama. That is the prospect. Also, they will be denied the opportunity to use swimming pools, two or three of which might be closed. They will be denied extra basic equipment—books, jotters and sundries. Parents are already having to provide that equipment through school boards, parent teacher associations and other private arrangements outwith the statutory system. The pupils of whom I am speaking will be denied school concerts, access to extra-curricular activities and the current level of library services. They will be denied well-maintained and safe properties, which are conducive to good learning. Owing to larger classes and reduced supply cover, they will be deprived of teacher support. Some—or most—of them may be denied the opportunity to have a hot mid-day meal. They will be denied teachers who, through in-service and advisory support, keep abreast of current developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and I have attended meetings in our region—including one in Hawick last week of nearly 1,000 people and one in Galashiels on Friday of 500 or 600 people—points have been raised concerning the present Administration's warped sense of priorities, given that the Prime Minister has recently prattled on about resources for introducing into schools a cadet corps, with its attendant gun culture, when primary schools face cuts such as I have described. What warped sense of priorities on the Government's part allows lottery developments of hundreds of millions of pounds on some great millennium project in Greenwich, when the fabric of school buildings in the region that I am speaking about is to be subject to cuts? Also, the advertising costs of the voucher scheme—£860,000—represent a substantial sum of money in the context of what is available in the borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My comments have related only to primary education, without examining cuts in other respects, such as the 50 per cent. reduction for road surfacing or the 10 per cent. that will be cut from the council's central budget. My remarks have not dealt with swimming pool cuts, the discontinuation of free plastic sacks, the closure of some residential homes or their potential transfer to the private sector. All those things will happen in the region next year if extra resources are not provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council has been a model of what councils should have been in the past: it has operated within budget caps. It would need 1,350 extra staff to reach the Scottish average. It has a low council tax—£558 at band D. The rates for uncollected tax have been about 4 per cent, for years. Everything that can be done is being done by Scottish Borders council to try to mitigate the cuts. Our plea to the Government this morning is for more help and flexibility. Admittedly, the authority is to receive an additional £726,000 next year. However, police and fire costs could increase by £2 million. There is a prospect of pay awards of £1.8 million, price increases of £1.3 million and service demand increases of £1.3 million. Extra duties have been imposed on the authority with respect to community care and school security and under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. Those responsibilities have a potential cost of about £1.6 million. The total is £8 million above the capping limit of £112 million. That is a serious state of affairs to confront.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
The most unfair aspect of the matter is that, as a percentage of grant-aided expenditure, the council's capping limit is very low. It is about 1 per cent. However, the corresponding figures for such places as Aberdeen and Dundee are as high as 12 per cent. Why are we being restricted and not allowed the flexibility to spend more next year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and I both know from family experience the value of primary schools. Both my children went to Kirkhope primary school—a rural school in the Ettrick valley—and benefited from that. Both went to Selkirk high school and benefited from instrumental tuition. My daughter was given access to music there. She was given a bassoon, and one of the proudest moments of my life was in 1994, when I listened to the Borders regional wind orchestra playing in St. Giles's cathedral. Some Americans sitting behind us were saying, "How is it that in America such standards of musical attainment are not reached by our children?" We pursue such standards now, but if the Under-Secretary is not careful, we will not do it for much longer. My children are about to leave the school system, so perhaps I am lucky. Perhaps I have missed some of the worst effects of the Government's education policies. However, the circumstances that I have described are unconscionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has a job to do in the next 10 minutes. He must give the people of the region some hope that he will, at least, reconsider. The council has met difficulty because its predecessor authorities ran low budgets. That is accepted. Now there is no fat left to cut. My hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) made that point eloquently. We need extra resources in the form of a raised capping limit and some of the disregards that accompany that. The Secretary of State has agreed to meet my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and me after the Committee to examine some of the technical questions—because some aspects of the matter are technical in their details. However, local people find it impossible to understand what the council is being forced to contemplate. There is great confusion concerning the Government's understanding of what is happening. Judging by what Ministers say, they really believe that no cuts are being made. The cuts are real. If the Under-Secretary really believes otherwise, will he agree to meet the councillors who are contemplating the current state of affairs, and tell them what the council should be doing? The question was put to him earlier by my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. People in Selkirk will want him to answer.

This morning's debate has been interesting. I have not been impressed by many of the contributions, but one of my fellow Under-Secretaries, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) ably outlined the Government's significant achievements in education matters in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start by dealing with the points that were made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) about the Borders council, because we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
are in the borders. I join the hon. Gentleman in offering a mark of respect to the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) who is retiring at the general election. I hope that he will have a long and happy retirement, and I look forward to his seat being won by a Conservative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of the Scottish Borders council is a serious one, and we should try to get some facts straight. I will not go over the entire local government settlement once again, because I am sure that Opposition Members know only too well that we have indeed increased funding for local government. Indeed, the official Opposition have stated that they would give no more to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Borders council can, in 1997–98, increase its expenditure within its capping limits by 1.9 per cent.—£2 million. The former Borders regional council made it very clear to us, during arguments about reorganisation, that bringing five local authorities into one unitary authority would result in savings of £1.7 million. But that saving could be distributed elsewhere in the overall budget. The fact is that the Borders council, or at least its convenor, has spent the past two or three weeks telling people of a horrific list of totally unnecessary cuts—cuts from a budget that is able to be increased by about £2 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About two or three weeks ago, 	<i>The Scotsman</i> published a list of all the local authorities in Scotland and the cuts that they believed would be needed. From those figures—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures may not be right, but 	<i>The Scotsman</i> obtained them from the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past two weeks, Scottish Borders council has told the Scottish Office that it believes that it will have to make cuts worth £8 million. That figure indicates that the council's apparent budget represents an increase on last year of more than 9 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire compared capping limits in the borders with those in Aberdeen city. I can tell him that the capping limit for Aberdeen city council can increase next year by 1.66 per cent. He really must get his facts straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) and for East Lothian talked about musical education in schools. I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is keen to see local authorities use their powers of prioritisation to encourage musical education in schools. I sympathise with the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire on the benefits of musical education. If local authorities do not give priority to such areas of education, and where it is desired by the population, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said today that he will be quite happy to consider making specific grants. However, that would clearly have to come off the overall settlement, which would be to sliced. It would obviously not be extra money. The hon. Gentleman is asking for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
extra money, but in the current climate of public expenditure constraint, no one could say that a budget increase of 2 per cent. was unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members have talked about the distribution of the overall pot of local government funding. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) mentioned the president of COSLA, Councillor Keith Geddes, but Mr. Geddes has a problem. He, along with the convenor, Councillor Tulley of Scottish Borders council, are members of COSLA. The distribution of the pot of local government funding is decided by a formula agreed jointly by COSLA and the Scottish Office. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland wrote to Councillor Geddes on Friday, putting to him the Labour party policy proposed by the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson), who has said that he believes that there should be an independent review of the distribution formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask members of COSLA, particularly the convenor of Scottish Borders council and Councillor Geddes whether they stand by that independent review or whether they stand by what they have said all along—that the distribution committee and the formula do a sensible and good job for local authorities in Scotland. They cannot sit on the fence; they cannot be on both sides at the same time. They must decide whether they agree with the present distribution formula or whether it does not work and should be totally changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with rural authorities such as Scottish Borders, because over the coming years there could well be scope for changing the grant-aided expenditure distribution for rural authorities. But the present arrangement has been set as much by COSLA—including by the convenor of Scottish Borders council, who is a member of COSLA—as by the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What is wrong with an independent review of the relationship between central Government and local government? The Government have over 18 years presided over a conflict between central Government and local government—a confrontation that has worked against the best interests of the Scottish people. We propose to hold in advance of the Scottish Parliament an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
independent review—of the kind that the Government denied us before reorganisation. What on earth can be wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now distorting what I said. I was talking about the reference to distribution made not just by him but by his leader and master, the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair). They referred to Glasgow in their opinion not getting a fair deal. In fact, the Labour party today has said absolutely nothing different about funding from what it has been saying for the past few days and weeks, since it—or at least its masters in Islington and Dunfermline—said that there will be no more spending on local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton supposedly aspires to be Secretary of State for Scotland. He hammers the Government for lack of funding and talks about crisis and cuts, but he would give local government no more money. He must come clean and say what he would do if he were in office. There is no point in his complaining about what we are doing if he has no alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to education, the subject of today's debate. The increase in GAE this year is about £40 million. We have increased education spending, so there is absolutely no reason for local authorities in Scotland to hit education spending. However, we are in the silly season of pre-budget setting and a pre-election period. The convenor of the council here is intent on frightening the people—I spoke to some of them outside this morning—about cuts in service delivery, when he should be quietly sitting down, looking at his budget and considering how he can balance expenditure with revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Govan mentioned Councillor Geddes and COSLA. We all know what is the secret agenda of the Labour party, the hon. Member for Govan and Councillor Keith Geddes: it is to hold a government funding review. That will be a back-door way of increasing local government funding. Funding will be increased by raising council taxes—the Labour party wants to do away with capping, and so does the convenor of Scottish Borders council, who wants council taxes here to rise through the roof. The Labour party also wants to do away with the uniform business rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillor Geddes has added another dimension: he wants a tourism tax. I ask the small businesses in the Scottish borders to consider how the removal of the uniform business rate and the return of business rates to local government control, combined with a bed tax on tourism, would affect them. That would have a catastrophic effect on jobs.

It would be good if we have had a Parliament in Scotland that could make decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise the issue of the Algrade trust and the home that it used to run at Humbie, which is on the other side of Lammermuir hills in my constituency. It should not be necessary again to raise in Committee questions about the Algrade trust, because I told the Minister the whole tragic story in an Adjournment debate on the Floor of the House just over a year ago, on 16 January 1996. In his reply, he assured me that the issue was being fully investigated by the police, the Crown Office and other Government Departments and he undertook to keep me advised about progress. What happened was an awful episode of abuse and neglect of handicapped people in a privately owned and managed home, and I suspect that important conclusions from the investigation of the affairs of the Algrade trust are being swept under the carpet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a brief summary of the background to the affair. The Humbie home was established in 1968 to provide accommodation and care for up to 40 handicapped people—mostly people with Down's syndrome. The Algrade trust was set up as a recognised charitable body to run the home and a religious commitment was a prominent feature in its constitution. For a period of years the home fulfilled the terms of its trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in 1984 the social work department of Lothian regional council became concerned that the handicapped residents at Humbie were not being looked after properly, and that there seemed to be serious defects in the accommodation, inadequate staffing and other problems. The council intervened to demand improvements in the management of the home. The then trustees fiercely resisted the council's attempts to ensure that standards were raised and things went from bad to worse. In 1987, the trustees engaged the services of Mr. John White as an adviser to maximise their income from the Department of Social Security and to keep costs down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained last year, the accommodation was dreadful; the heating was inadequate and dangerous; food rations were pitiful; and the residents were being cynically exploited as cheap labour for a cafe in Path Head that belonged to an obscure religious sect. There were allegations of serious sexual abuse by a member of staff. At that stage, the trust was receiving £420,000 a year from the Department of Social Security, but it was spending only £36,000 a year on staffing at the home. With that level of income and only minimal costs, the charitable trust must have been generating substantial profits. There is reason to believe that money was being diverted for other purposes, in particular to purchase property for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
trustees' religious organisation. There were further allegations that resident' families were put under pressure to give property to that organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters were reported to the police and the Scottish Charities Office at the end of 1994 and, in December 1995, Lothian region's social work department negotiated an arrangement whereby the Algrade trustees resigned, new trustees took over and the 33 residents were moved into better temporary accommodation at Inveresk under the care of the Church of Scotland's board for social responsibility. I visited them there last summer and am entirely satisfied that they are being looked after properly and encouraged to develop in a friendly and civilised environment. But we are still left with the legacy of neglect, and worse, from the previous Algrade regime, which is why I raised the matter in the House last year. I wanted to be sure that allegations of serious sexual abuse were dealt with. I wanted an investigation of the whole sad story to ensure that money and assets would be retrieved and used for the benefit of the residents. I wanted to know that lessons had been learnt so as to eliminate the risk of anything like it ever happening again in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another year has passed. On 28 January last year Robert Herriot was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on charges of sexually abusing 11 male residents in his care at Humbie over a period of 10 years. That reveals an appalling lack of proper care and management by the former Algrade trustees. I understand that the successful prosecution has concluded the matter of abuse at the Algrade homes, although I fear that the damage done to those residents is bound to be permanent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues of neglect of the residents and of the alleged diversion of Department of Social Security funding have not been concluded. The Minister told me last year that the necessary lessons must be learnt and that he would keep me in touch with events. I kept asking parliamentary questions about the progress of the Crown Office investigation but was continually fobbed off. For example, the Minister said in February last year that the investigation was making good progress. He said that some new matters had emerged in the course of the investigation and that further work was required on points arising from the accounting report, and into aspects of the property transaction. He said that the investigation was unlikely to be concluded before the end of June last year. That was 1996, and it all sounded encouraging. On 24 July 1996 the Lord Advocate wrote to me stating,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a fair and impartial investigation into the conduct of the previous trustees and administration"</p></blockquote>
at Algrade would take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most recently, in December last, the Minister informed me that the Scottish Charities Office was continuing to make inquiries into the past circumstances of the Algrade trust, including its accounting and expenditure and the purchase and conveyance of property. He said that the nature and extent of the inquiries were such that it would be some time before they were completed and the results known. By that date the inquiry had been going on for two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suddenly, last week, on the day on which Robert Herriot was sentenced in the High Court, the Scottish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
Charities Office issued a brief press statement, quoted in 	<i>The Herald</i> as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These investigations have found no evidence of dishonesty. They did discover evidence of past mismanagement but not serious enough to justify civil proceedings, particularly as the trustees had already removed themselves from the management."</p></blockquote>
That appears to be that, despite a ghastly episode of abuse and neglect, the apparent diversion of up to £2 million of Department of Social Security funding intended for the care of handicapped residents, reports of wheeling and dealing involving property at Humbie and Pathhead—I am grateful to my hon. Friend and Member for Midlothian (Mr. Clarke) for attending the debate because Pathhead is in his constituency—and the obvious public concern about and interest in the outcome of the investigation, not to mention the need for credible assurances that nothing like this will every happen again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that we are dealing with determined and difficult people. There have been threats of action and much bluster from Mr. John White against me and the BBC's programme "Frontline Scotland" which did so much to research and expose this affair. When I offered to meet the new trustees to discuss the situation they refused to let me see their accountants' report so I assumed that they had something to hide. The Minister and his Department cannot be allowed to sweep this sordid affair under the carpet. The Scottish Charities Office's report must be published so that the people—especially the families—who care about the Humbie residents can be assured that lessons have been learnt and that the money that should have been spent on the care and welfare of those handicapped people will be used for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Robert Herriot's conviction is important, but his wicked abuse was not the whole story. The matters of neglect and the diversion of resources must also be dealt with, and be seen to be dealt with. It is clear that tougher, more effective powers are needed to enable local authorities to inspect and regulate private care homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The press release from the Scottish Charities Office last week cannot be accepted as the final word. The Crown Office report into the affairs of the Algrade trust must be made available to the families of the residents, and published. Any restitution that is due must be paid in full—nothing less will do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to reply to the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and to set out the position on the Algrade trust and the action that has been taken. I wrote to the hon. Gentleman on 18 June 1996 describing the progress that had been made to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Algrade trust is a recognised charity, which provides accommodation and a home for people with learning difficulties. For more than 25 years, until 1995, the home was run by its founding trustees. It was popular and respected, and was well regarded by many residents, parents and independent parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Algrade home was registered with the relevant social work authority, the then Lothian regional council, for most of its history and that authority was responsible
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
for the supervision of arrangements at the home. Inspections were carried out from time to time and a number of shortcomings were identified relating to management arrangements, staffing, the form of care and general standards within the home. Over the last 10 years of its existence, social workers became increasingly concerned, but no steps were taken to deregister the establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In October 1994, the director of the social work department sent a report expressing concerns about Algrade to the Scottish Charities Office, and that was the first involvement of that office. The report criticised the trustees for being resistant to modern thinking in their approach to the care of residents and for their reluctance to incur expenditure on the improvement of standards of heating and accommodation at the premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence contained in the report was not sufficient to found a case of misconduct or mismanagement under the supervision of charities legislation. In the opinion of counsel for the charities office, it was more revealing of personality differences and of differences in approach between the trustees and the social workers. The question of withdrawal of registration was raised with the director of social work by the charities office, but he chose not to exercise that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Charities Office began its own inquiries into the administration of the Algrade trust. The office was established in 1992 and it operates under the authority of the Lord Advocate in the implementation of the supervision of charities legislation. The statute provides that the Lord Advocate may conduct investigations into concerns about misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of charities. If those concerns prove to be well founded, the Lord Advocate may apply to the Court of Session for orders, including suspending and removing trustees from office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the intervention of the charities office, the original trustees tendered their resignations. The principal trustees actively engaged in running the charity were three elderly ladies, one of whom has since died; the two survivors are both aged 78. Four new trustees were appointed in consultation with the charities office and they were prepared to take over the management and control of Algrade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new trustees are particularly well qualified. One is a chartered accountant with experience in management, one is a general medical practitioner and another is a former school headmistress with experience of working with people with learning disabilities. The new trustees worked well with the Scottish Charities Office, with the Church of Scotland board of social responsibility, which had taken over the day-to-day running of Algrade, with the local social work department and with the parents and guardians of the residents. Not least, the new trustees worked well with the residents themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through those efforts, the residents of Algrade have moved from their previous premises at Humbie and are now accommodated in premises at Wedderburn, near Musselburgh. The premises are of a standard acceptable to the social work department, and the residents are happy in their new home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intervention of the charities office brought about the resignation of the original trustees and their replacement with the present trustees. It also permitted the good work of the charity to continue in the interests of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
the residents while allowing time for a fair and impartial investigation to take place into the conduct of the previous trustees and administration. The present trustees worked with the charities office during those inquiries. The charities office's approach is to preserve charities where possible and thus allow their good work to continue to the advantage of the beneficiaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way later, if I may, as I have many points to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accounting records of the previous Algrade administration were examined in the course of the investigation. They were found to be below the standard expected by the current supervision legislation. A firm of experienced chartered accountants was engaged to examine the accounts and put together a financial picture of the previous administration at Algrade. This process would have the effect of identifying any irregularities in financial matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the income—92 per cent.—of the Algrade trust came from payments made by the Department of Social Security. The investigation of the accounting records revealed that in the 26-year period, 1969 to 1995, the total income of the trust, including DSS payments, amounted to £6.5 million. The total expenditure was £5.3 million. That expenditure included staffing costs of £2.2 million, provision of food and household costs of £0.8 million, general maintenance of the residential properties of £0.86 million, transport and administration costs of £1.2 million and residents' pocket money £0.24 million. Of the surplus of income over expenditure of £1.2 million, £0.8 million was used in the purchase of heritable properties and the remaining £0.4 million still existed in the form of liquid assets comprising cash and investments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said, I have a vested interest in the matter. So many houses were purchased in a small community, that the village was being institutionalised. The busy village cafe on the A68 employed people looked after by the trust. The local people thought that that was exploitation. There was no mention of this, the profitability of the operation or of the purchasing of the houses. A number of houses were bought at the asking price; there was no haggling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's contribution. I was just coming to the subject of properties in Pathhead in his constituency, and I will go through them one by one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Residents at Algrade were accommodated in some of these properties, while others had been suitably furnished with the intention of providing such accommodation in the future. The purchase of heritable properties for such use was within the power of the former trustees. These purchases were a response to pressure on the former trustees from the social work department following a change in thinking and emphasis from institutionalised care to care in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no truth in the allegation that there is any unaccounted for shortfall in the funds received by the original trustees and no evidence to suggest that such moneys were used by the trustees for other than the provision of care for the residents of Algrade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
Inquiries were made with the Department of Social Security in London. Those inquiries confirmed that the sums paid by the DSS were paid to the trustees of Algrade for the purpose of the provision of care. In 1994 this sum was £245 per week per resident. This included a pocket money element of £13 per week which was credited to the residents by the original trustees who opened post office savings accounts in their names. In total, £236,000 was accounted for in this manner. There is no missing £2 million as described by the hon. Gentleman. The accounts of Satellite and Video Ministries, a business run by the former trustees, were also examined and there is no evidence of money being taken from the Algrade trust into Satellite and Video Ministries. There is no evidence of misappropriation of funds against the former trustees of Algrade. While there may have been shortcomings in the management abilities of the trustees, there is no evidence of dishonesty against any of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making some important points. Does he understand that the Algrade trust is not now caring for the former residents of Humbie? They are being cared for in property belonging to East Lothian council by the Church of Scotland's board of social responsibility. They are not providing care for the residents just now. All the assets that still belong to the Algrade trust are not being applied for the benefit of the residents. Nobody will believe his suggestion that 80 per cent. of all that money was used for the care of the residents. The only way in which this matter can be cleared up sensibly is if these reports can be made available to the public for public scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The present trustees are still paying as a result of the obligations entered into at an earlier stage. The hon. Gentleman asked about the findings of the investigation. They will be set out fully in the course of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the practice of the Crown Office to issue public reports on the detail of confidential inquiries into charities. In many cases the degree of mismanagement is not such as to warrant public disclosure. Any serious instances of misconduct would be, and have been, made public in court proceedings. In other instances, publication would carry an unacceptable and unwarranted risk of damage to the reputation of the charitable sector as well as hampering the work of the investigation by making the public reluctant to come forward with information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Charities Office examined concerns about a number of heritable properties purchased by the former trustees. The investigation revealed that the former trustees purchased 13 properties, including Algrade school. A further property, the Gospel hall, was a gift to the trustees. The total sum spent on these property purchases was £0.9 million, of which subsequent sales realised £0.1 million, reducing the property figure to the £0.8 million referred to earlier. In all except five cases, those heritable properties were recorded in the property register in the normal and appropriate legal form. They were recorded in the names of the trustees, but only as trustees for the charity, not for their own benefit as individuals. The titles to the other five properties were recorded in the names of the original trustees, as individuals, for their own personal benefit. The Charities Office gave particular scrutiny to those properties. In three of those five cases, the investigation confirmed that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
original trustees had purchased the properties from the trust for full value. There is therefore no impropriety in respect of those three properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the two final properties, and will consider first the Gospel hall. There is dispute as to whether that gift is to the trustees as individuals or as trustees of Algrade. This is a matter of civil dispute which is presently the subject of negotiation between the present and the original trustees. In the final property case, the investigation revealed that the original trustees paid £36,000 for a property purchased from the trust. The price was the same as that paid by the trust for the property some seven years earlier. There is a further civil dispute between the present trustees and the original trustees as to whether that was an adequate price, given the possible rise in the value of the property over the period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that those are both civil issues upon which the parties are taking legal advice and do not involve any allegation of criminal conduct on the part of the original trustees. The civil dispute is rigidly being conducted by the present trustees of Algrade—those responsible for the management and control of the Algrade trust. Those people have the right to take action should they feel that money is due from any party to the Algrade trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to finish the factual points. The present trustees keep the Charities Office informed of their action and the Charities Office continues to monitor the progress made by the present trustees. The police have been involved in respect of a number of allegations. The first of those were allegations of serious criminal activities made against a man, Robert Herriot. Those were investigated by the local police and the procurator fiscal at Haddington. Mr. Robert Herriot was subsequently charged with serious crimes of indecent conduct against a resident and tendered pleas of guilty on 28 January at the High Court in Edinburgh. He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment by Lord Marnoch, but there is no evidence that the original trustees were in any way aware of his conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter involving the police concerns allegations relating to the making of wills by Algrade residents. It was alleged that improper pressure had been brought to bear upon the residents, particularly in view of their learning disabilities, to make wills in favour of the Algrade trust or the former trustees. The police investigated the matter, but found no evidence of criminal conduct. There are no ongoing police inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, the hon. Member for East Lothian has referred to a will that was made by an elderly blind man. There was such a will, in which the man left one third of his estate to one of the original trustees. The inquiries confirmed that the will was made with the benefit of legal advice, and was signed by the man in the presence of his solicitor. Furthermore, the testator changed his mind and revoked the will a few days later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence of impropriety in the wills made by other residents. Those 12 wills were among the papers that the new trustees recovered. The legal adviser to the new trustees examined them. One of the wills leaves the testator's estate to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"my friends at Algrade, Humbie".</p></blockquote>
Specific relatives are named in the other 11 wills. Three testators leave their estates to their sisters. In eight wills, brothers are named as the sole beneficiaries. The former trustees do not appear as executors, witnesses or, most importantly, beneficiaries in any of the wills. There is no evidence of fraud or improper conduct in making the wills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summation, a tragic picture has emerged from the inquiries of people who devoted their lives to the residents of Algrade, but became unable to cope with increased managerial responsibilities in their later years. They tendered their resignations soon after the intervention of the Scottish Charities Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Of the principal trustees, one has died, and the other two are aged 78. They are no longer in a position of management or control at Algrade, and they are not likely to be so involved in any other charitable organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Charities Office investigation revealed evidence of mismanagement by the former trustees, but not of crime, and especially not of dishonesty in their actions during their administration. The hon. Gentleman's earlier allegations of fraud or embezzlement are unfounded. It would be wrong to engage in a witch hunt; it is not a case for retribution. The supervision set out in charities legislation proved effective, in that the involvement of the Charities Office led to the replacement of the former trustees and the continuation of the charity's good work for the benefit of the residents of Algrade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to those involved as members of an obscure sect. The Baptist denomination is not an obscure sect. The case is one of mismanagement, not criminal activity, with the obvious exception of the man who was quite properly sent to prison for seven years for his outrageous conduct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the on-going dispute between the former and current trustees over the assets. I am worried that people are losing sight of the residents in all this. The assets were DSS assets—public funds—that were meant to be used for the care of the residents of Algrade, who suffered wicked neglect. What will be done to ensure that the assets will now be used for their original purpose? Many people will read the Minister's words carefully. He has gone so far that I ask him to go the rest of the way and publish at least an edited version of the Charities Office report, so that everyone is satisfied that everything that needs to be done is being done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the report, full information has been given to the Lord Advocate, but not in a published report. If the hon. Gentleman wants answers, he can table a large number of parliamentary questions and I shall provide precise information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made it clear to the hon. Gentleman that the present trustees are keeping the Charities Office informed of what is happening. The Charities Office will continue to monitor the trustees' progress in resolving outstanding matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulatory action through courts is unnecessary. All that needed to be done has been done. The former trustees have resigned from office, and the good work of the charity is continuing under the management of the present trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
Mismanagement came about because the advanced age of the previous trustees meant that they were unable to cope and were reluctant to adapt to new approaches to the care of residents. As I said, one of the previous trustees has died. The other two are both aged 78, and one of them keeps ill health. Neither has any other connection with the voluntary sector. Therefore I do not see this as a case for retribution. No useful purpose could be served by court proceedings under the supervision of charities legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to add that the Church of Scotland has performed an invaluable role in helping and giving support to the residents, who are now being well looked after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
