<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the Committee that there is a money resolution and that starred amendments will not normally be selected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. A list of documents that are relevant to our discussion of the Bill was circulated by the Secretary of State. One is the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, which the Government, having taken so long to put on the statute book, are about to destroy. I notice that that document has not been made available to the Committee this morning. Have they not supplied a copy because they are so embarrassed that they are about to destroy their own Act?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair. Documents are made available for members of the Committee by arrangement with the Government. If there is a shortage of documents, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will take that up with the Minister concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin, on a different matter. It is rather embarrassing that we were notified only a short while ago that some parents from Dunblane are in the building. I hope that they will come to the Committee, but they are elsewhere at the moment. I hope that you will understand, Mr. Martin if some of us have to leave the Room because we feel obliged to speak to them as constituents or friends and to invite them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is understood that members of the Committee must leave the Room for good reasons from time to time. Going to see victims of the Dunblane tragedy is a perfectly good reason to leave the Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. On Second Reading the Secretary of State waxed eloquently about the number of measures in the Bill while having in his possession the report from the chief inspector of prisons on Cornton Vale. He did not share the information in that report, despite the fact that he has had it in his possession since August and that it has been known about in the Scottish Office since June. Have you had any communication, Mr. Martin, from the Secretary of State concerning what I consider to be lack of respect for Parliament?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those are not matters for the Chair. The business of the Chair is to ensure that the Committee is run properly. Reports and other such matters are for the usual channels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. May I inquire why none of those nice cuddly Liberal Democrats is in the Committee? They spoke at length on Second Reading and must realise that if they are to join our gang they will be expected to carry their fair share of the work. The omission of Liberal Democrats from the Committee is greatly regretted and I hope that you have an explanation, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been a Member of Parliament for a long time and we do not have gangs here. The Committee comprises hon. Members who are selected by the Committee of Selection and the hon. Gentleman should take the matter up with that Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill the Comittee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
If there are any documents that the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) wants, we shall ensure that they are made available to the Committee. There is already a large array in the Room, but if there is any omission, we shall seek to make good that omission as soon as possible.<br><br>
The issues contained in the Bill are of fundamental importance to the rule of law. It is vital that all parts of the Bill receive the scrutiny that they deserve. We must therefore ensure that the Committee makes good progress in considering the matters before it. Naturally, I hope that we can be suitably thorough without causing any unnecessary inconvenience to Ministers.<br><br>
It is absolutely right that we should devote whatever time is necessary to effect the passage of the Bill because it is one of the most significant pieces of legislation on crime and sentencing for years and it is in the interests of the public's protection. The Bill is designed to meet the needs and demands of the people of Scotland for protection. The sooner the provisions are in statute, the safer our country will be. The public must have confidence and faith in the system, which exists to defend their fundamental rights and freedoms. That is what the Bill seeks to achieve.<br><br>
We need sufficient time in Committee to do justice to the Bill. It covers changes in five major areas: minimum sentences, increased court powers, abolition of parole and automatic early release, more controls on teenage drinking and action to control the spiralling costs of criminal legal aid. The necessary time has to be made available in Committee because the Bill covers a lot of ground.<br><br>
This significant Bill will make the punishment fit the crime. Sentences served will be the sentences handed down by the court, and repeat drug traffickers will face a minimum of seven years in gaol. Repeat sexual and violent offenders will face a mandatory life sentence.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Even if they are subsequently released, they will be supervised for the rest of their lives and may be recalled to prison at any time. The Bill's provisions mean that people who commit serious crimes will go to prison and stay there until they are no longer a threat to public safety. That is why the Bill merits the Committee's serious and in-depth consideration. If we take seriously our responsibility to protect the Scottish people, we cannot afford to delay the Bill's passage on to the statute book. The motion will allow sufficient time for the discussion of the important matters that I have mentioned. I hope that we have a satisfactory discussion of the sitting arrangements through the usual channels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that the Bill is of fundamental importance and that we must ensure its progress through the House. However, we must examine it in great detail.<br><br>
I must remind the Minister of a letter that he sent the other day to all members of the Committee, which included a list of legislation and other relevant documents that are referred to in the Bill. Will he ensure that all those documents are available in Committee so that we can examine them?<br><br>
Those documents include the Police (Scotland) Act 1967, the Firearms Act 1968, the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the Immigration Act 1971, the Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 1976, the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984, the Foster Children (Scotland) Act 1984, the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989, the Local Government Finance Act 1992, the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993—which my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) said had mysteriously disappeared—the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the Drug Trafficking Act 1994, the Environment Act 1995, the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995, the Criminal Procedure (Consequential Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1995, the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act 1995 and the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. It would also be handy if he could make available the consultation document, "Making the Punishment Fit the Crime", to which he referred, the White Paper, "Crime and Punishment" and the report by the Committee on Criminal Appeals and Miscarriages of Justice Procedures, otherwise known as the Sutherland Committee.<br><br>
The Minister will realise from that litany that we are discussing a Bill of fundamental importance but also of deep complexity. It is, therefore, important that we discuss the Bill in detail and do not allow it to be rushed through. I remember, a few years ago, sitting in the Committee that was considering the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993. The Minister was also involved in that Committee and we had a good discussion on the issues. Indeed, we had mutual concerns, which were addressed in Committee, so it is sad that all that work has been turned over simply because of the presence of the right hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) as Secretary of State for Scotland. I remember the work that we have done in the past year or two on the Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 1996 and on the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, when we discussed the legislation in the Scottish Grand Committee and held evidence sessions in Scotland.<br><br>
The Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 1996 was a three-clause Bill, of which clause 1 was the major clause. As a result of consultations in Scotland and the hearings that were held, we came back to Westminster, threw out clause 1 and inserted a new clause. In other words, we changed about 90 per cent. of the Bill as a result of those hearings. Sadly, we do not have that opportunity today. Frankly, the Minister and the public know that the Bill has been introduced in the dying days of this Government to try to make up for the folly of their previous Acts and for the fact that they have not been the party of law and order. We do not want to go along with that exercise because we wish to be serious about our intentions. We welcome several aspects of the Bill, but other aspects cause us great concern. Indeed, they cause concern to the judiciary, to those with experience of criminal affairs and to members of the public. I take exception to what the Minister said: that the sooner the Bill becomes law, the safer we will be. We have heard the same comments for the past 17 years.<br><br>
The Bill is based on the White Paper "Crime and Punishment". I read the White Paper when it was published earlier in the year and agree with many of the points made in it. It is well written, but I suggest to the Minister that it contains more rhetoric than action and its rhetoric is not being translated into the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill.<br><br>
For example, chapter 1 of the White Paper says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government does not accept that crime is something which 'just happens'. There is no excuse for criminal behaviour and those who commit crime must be caught and made to face up to the consequences of their actions."</p></blockquote>
The Opposition entirely agree with that. There is no excuse for criminal behaviour. As the White Paper goes on to say in paragraph 1.2,
<br><blockquote><p>"the fight against crime goes much wider than the detection of criminals, vital as that is. It starts with family values: how we treat children and bring them up and what we teach in our schools. It is reflected in the attitudes we have to offending, drugs and alcohol and the way in which we structure our communities."</p></blockquote>
That is the wider picture, which the Government have failed to ignore in all their deliberations. But that wider picture is significant in terms of how our penal system is structured and its effects on the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made a slip of the tongue. He said that we "failed to ignore" when he probably meant that we "failed to address".</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. It is the first time that he and I have agreed fully on anything, and I will be delighted to see it recorded in Hansard.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
We have failed to address those issues. The Bill's emphasis on punishment alone is a little one-sided, and it is that aspect to which we will take exception.<br><br>
The Government's record on crime and punishment during the past 17 years—we have gone over this litany before—has been abysmal in Scotland. Almost 1 million crimes were committed in Scotland in that time compared with 600,000 when the Government took office. We acknowledge that the crime figures have come down in the past few years, but that is due to the good work in local communities. Despite that, continuing concern remains—as evidenced by the Government's White Paper—about the increase of violent crime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing the sittings motion. The hon. Gentleman will assist me if, from time to time, he mentions Tuesdays and Thursdays.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I am sure that on certain Tuesdays and Thursdays we will mention that in 1994–95 the number of cases involving the handling of offensive weapons increased. The Government have not tackled that, which is why we need to discuss such matters very seriously.<br><br>
The issue of minimum sentences is important. What consultation did the Government have with individuals in the judiciary and the wider community on that subject? I fear that the Crime (Sentences) Bill for England and Wales uncannily resembles this Bill. The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary have put their heads together and decided to put through what they consider to be populist measures. Profound objections have already been made by Lord Hope, the Lord President, and other judges on minimum sentences. That is why we need to address these issues on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend find it as offensive as I do that an English hon. Member, who will probably not contribute to the Committee, is sitting sneering and laughing at such a serious subject when he probably sat on the Committee that considered the Bill that the Government are about to destroy? It shows how flippantly Conservative Members treat crime—in fact, all Scottish issues—and how to deal with it in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that. I did not notice the hon. Member for Colchester, North (Mr. Jenkin). However, I welcome the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) to the Committee. I am delighted to see him in his place ready to embark on his rottweiler activities over the forthcoming days and weeks.<br><br>
Minimum sentencing is an important issue that we must address on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The Minister mentions in the White Paper that, as part of the wider picture—I shall want more information on this—further measures are being planned or are in hand on initiatives on school discipline. What initiatives does he have and will he bring them before the Committee? As for the "Scotland Against Drugs"
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
campaign, the project involving young people and crime, the Programme for Partnership and the regeneration of deprived areas, I am aware of the good work that has been carried out in places such as Dundee, Aberdeen Castlemilk and some parts of Edinburgh. In my visits to those projects, people have told me that there is a lack of resources, and perhaps a lack of commitment, from the Government to ensure that the projects continue in the medium and long term. We must turn our attention to that issue as the days and weeks pass.<br><br>
On the subject of the abolition of parole, the Government say that we need honesty in sentencing. I agree entirely. I am sure that the Labour party and other Opposition parties will not differ from the Government over that issue.<br><br>
A few short years ago in the Committee which dealt with the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Bill, we discussed honesty in sentencing, but we also discussed rehabilitation. The Minister of State was bold enough to suggest that there is another aspect to crime—that criminals, young or old, should be put behind bars because punishment is important, but that if we want to build a better society, punishment must include rehabilitation.<br><br>
The former Secretary of State for Scotland—the right hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang)—suggested that opportunities for parole would give prisoners an extra incentive and that rehabilitation would also be addressed so that when individuals left prison, they would perhaps offend less. That was the rationale behind the Government's proposal at the time and, as I mentioned, it has changed only because of the presence of the right hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) as Secretary of State for Scotland.<br><br>
Judges, penal experts, prison officers, the public and I do not think that our proceedings constitute the proper way to go about penal affairs in Scotland. When the Committee meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays, we will have no opportunity to gather evidence from experts in Scotland. I think that that will lead to a deficiency in the legislative timetable. Only a few short weeks ago, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Hurd), a distinguished former Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary, stated that Parliament is no good at legislation and that it needs to change its approach. To tackle an issue as fundamental as crime, surely we need to speak to people in Scotland and find out exactly what the implications might be.<br><br>
Over the coming weeks, will the Minister address the implications of the early release proposals? The Secretary of State for Scotland has changed parole overnight leading the prison service to state in a press release that within 12 months of the Bill being enacted, the prison population will increase by 1,000. The current prison population in Scotland is touching 6,000, which represents overcrowding of almost 500—the establishment figure. What will happen in a year's time when the population increases by 1,000? What will happen in four or five years' time when the effects of the early release measure are implemented, when the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0018">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
prison population will have increased by between 2,000 and 2,500? Such an increase would require four or five extra prisons. The Secretary of State has approved an extra prison to be built in Kilmarnock, but that will not be ready until 1999. One year after the Bill is enacted, the present prison establishment will have to cope with an extra 1,000 prisoners.<br><br>
In our deliberations on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I want hon. Members and the Minister to address themselves to that point. We remember the instability and riots in the prisons in the mid-1980s, especially in Peterhead. No one wants a repeat of that. We must have public order in the prison system. At the moment, the Secretary of State is committing the crime of rushing ahead, making popular statements and taking measures without any thought whatever for the wellbeing of the prison service. That is unforgivable. It is a dereliction of duty and is unfair to those who run the prison service and those who are in it.<br><br>
I want the Minister to consider Cornton Vale. The only person who has been silent on that issue during the past six months has been the Secretary of State for Scotland, despite the fact that he has ultimate responsibility for the prison and that it is in his constituency. Whatever fatal accident inquiries have been held and whatever comments have been made, it is no sheer coincidence that five young women lost their lives in Cornton Vale over a period of 15 months. That situation must be dealt with and—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. These are serious matters but they should not be raised in a debate on the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the issue of early release and overcrowding will be extremely important. Cornton Vale is relevant to that issue because it is overcrowded. The Bill also deals with early release.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am trying to help the hon. Gentleman. I know that sometimes debates on sittings motions can be difficult. If a matter is mentioned in passing that is one thing: however, if the hon. Gentleman wants to discuss in detail Cornton Vale or any other institution, I suggest that once we have got the sittings motion out of the way, he could table amendments that would enable him to do so. That would suit me and the hon. Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton), who is also chairing the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I shall return to that issue but I am sure that it will also be mentioned by my hon. Friends. That the Government need to take action on the issue is illustrated by the fact that tomorrow Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons will officially publish his report on Cornton Vale.<br><br>
Another issue that will concern us in the Committee in the coming weeks is that of electronic tagging. The Secretary of State is introducing that measure in Scotland, despite the fact that Home Office studies have suggested that, in general, the initiative has failed in England and Wales. We are aware that in one European country—Sweden, I think—there has been a measure of success, because of the provision of social
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
aftercare. The Bill, however, provides no opportunity for social aftercare. Indeed, a memorandum states that the financial implications of the legislation will be largely neutral. If one believes that, one will believe anything—they will certainly not be neutral.<br><br>
The Opposition are interested in the issue of persistent young offenders. We want to eliminate the scourge of persistent young offenders and of antisocial neighbours but that must be done properly. It can only be achieved by dialogue with individuals in the Scottish community who are aware of such issues.<br><br>
We want to turn our attention to many other aspects of the Bill. I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Martin. As those Tuesdays and Thursdays go by, however, we shall discuss those issues in detail. We do not want the Bill enacted in haste but scrutinised line by line. I envisage the Minister, myself and others sitting here until Christmas to ensure that we thoroughly appraise the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support what my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton has said about the sittings motion. I have a specific reason for doing so. I think that you will agree with me, Mr. Martin, that it is too late now to turn the Committee into a Special Standing Committee, which is a great pity. The Minister and other members of the Committee will recall that not so long ago when we discussed the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, we agreed to have a special Standing Committee and it was valuable to all concerned. We were able to hear witnesses from a variety of organisations that were involved with children. Those witnesses were able to give us clear-cut advice with the result that we in the Committee were unanimous in the view we took on some issues and, even when we were not, at least we were all better informed and had a better approach towards producing what, in the end, was a useful piece of legislation.<br><br>
As I understand it, the Government want us to press ahead with the Bill as fast as possible because they want to get on with introducing other Bills. That is not a good reason to hasten the passage of legislation. The Committee can make up for not being a Special Standing Committee by taking more time and by ensuring that we do not sit after 1 o'clock on Thursdays. That would allow time for Committee Members to read the sizeable mass of material coming from many organisations and to avail ourselves of the opportunity to meet people who have expertise on the wide variety of issues set out in the Bill.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 runs to about 90 sections and umpteen schedules; this Bill runs to about 50 clauses and includes issues that involve the police, prison officers and social workers. We could hear people from Women's Aid, rape crisis centres, child law centres and, indeed, the judiciary. Since none of that can be dealt with in Committee, we need to avail ourselves of the opportunity to get in touch with such people outside Committee hours so that we are better informed about what we are doing. We are in danger of passing law in haste, which would be ill-informed.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Every Committee member knows what happens when matters progress too quickly: people read in their newspapers about legislation that has been passed by the House of Commons when it is too late to do anything about it. I want to relate that problem to the times at which we sit and how long we sit on any one day. While we are sitting in Committee, we cannot be reading other documents or meeting relevant people. On the subject of Cornton Vale, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton, it was only recently that I read that the availability of drugs was partly related to the suicides. We have all known for years, and the Secretary of State agrees, that there are many prisoners in Cornton Vale who should not be in prison at all because they are not a danger to society. We need to consider what else can be done and for that, we need time. Social workers could tell us about mental disorder and electronic tagging.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady suggests that she has no time to meet all these people, but the sittings motion is for Tuesdays and Thursdays. That means that the hon. Lady has Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays to hold all the meetings that she wants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands my point. We are all busy with constituency casework and other matters. I do not want the Committee to proceed with undue haste merely to ensure that the Government stick to a timetable of their own choosing to get through other legislation. Reading the relevant papers is an individual responsibility, but taking appropriate time over the Bill would open up the opportunity for those of us who so wish to meet the many people with an interest in ensuring that their views are heard and that the Committee is informed. The list includes the police, prison officers, social workers and people from Women's Aid, rape crisis centres and child law centres, groups of people from whom the Committee could usefully hear before dealing with the legislation. That is the point of the sittings motion. If we go through the Bill too quickly, it will be impossible to hold such meetings.<br><br>
Although the legislation is called the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill, it fails to address one of the more serious problems facing our judicial system: rape cases. For a long time, Scottish crime statistics have shown that most people—the vast majority—who are accused of rape are acquitted. New case statistics show that the number of cases coming to court is increasing, but that the proportion of defendants found guilty is falling.<br><br>
Something is badly wrong for acquittal rates to be so high compared to other trends. It is impossible to believe that all the cases were wrongly brought. There must be a great many defendants who are getting away with horrible crimes. The Bill does not deal with such serious issues although it could have done. Other countries, especially Australia, have dealt with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
problem. They have reduced their acquittal rates and are coming closer to finding guilty those who are guilty.<br><br>
The Minister and the Secretary of State have talked a lot about letting the punishment fit the crime, but a criminal must first be found guilty to receive any punishment whatsoever. Yet rape is affecting an increasing number of people. Many women are so frightened of the crime that it curtails their freedom to walk around at night in quiet streets. Women generally have a much more restricted lifestyle than men because they are afraid to walk about in the dark, particularly in lonely places, because they think that they might be attacked and that their attacker is more than likely to get away with it. The Committee could do with hearing from experts who could advise us.<br><br>
In conclusion, why does the Bill contain nothing to ensure fewer acquittals in rape cases? Bearing in mind what has been happening in other countries, it would be possible for the Scottish Office to conduct relevant research and introduce proposals. I am sorry that there are no such proposals, but perhaps some could be introduced by tabling new clauses or amendments at a later stage in our proceedings. If it is not possible within that timescale, I certainly hope that it will not be long before another Bill is introduced to deal with something that is causing great distress to far too many people. Not only do women suffer in court, but we now have evidence of them being pursued later by a defendant's relatives or friends, which make their lives a misery. If we are serious about tackling crime and punishment, we should acknowlege that problems have been completely ignored and the Committee should take time to address them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The hon. Member for Dumbarton made certain remarks about my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Gentleman said that he regretted my right hon. Friend's return. My right hon. Friend is prepared to tackle problems, in the criminal justice system and I look forward to debating those issues in the next few weeks, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It was the return of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to the Scottish Office that led to the practice of holding special hearings about which we have heard so much today. My right hon. Friend's push introduced those hearings, and I welcome that. I find it strange that special hearings were not an issue on Second Reading. As far as I could see, there was no mention of special hearings in the Labour party's amendment. Opposition Members did not push the issue to a vote. Instead of talking about things that might have been or should have been, we should be getting stuck into the Bill fairly quickly because it is important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not just an amendment, but what the Opposition described as their reasoned amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept my right hon. Friend's comment.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The term "reasoned amendment" is parliamentary language. What objection do the Conservatives have to that? As for the Secretary of State for Scotland returning and giving us hearings, why are there no hearings today? The Minister of State has turned on his head in the past three years, which is embarrassing for him. The hon. Gentleman realises that, so he should not go down that path for too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no problems going down that path. I commend a Government who make mistakes, then reddress them. Few Governments will never make a mistake. If the hon. Member for Dumbarton laughs, it suggests that he is a man who never makes a mistake, although earlier he acknowledged that he had made one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was the Government's responsibility to decide whether to have this form of Committee or a Special Standing Committee. Why does the hon. Gentleman think that the Government chose not to have a Special Standing Committee when so much advantage could have been gained from it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because the Government—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I intervene and say that we are straying from the sittings motion? Decisions about the shape of the Committee have been made, which is why we are attending the First Scottish Standing Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that completely, which is why I fail to understand why the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) went on for so long, without interruption, about special hearings. In the coming weeks when we debate the issue raised by the hon. Lady and look back at the 1993 Act, will my right hon. Friend bear in mind what was said in that Standing Committee and acknowledge that perhaps we listened too much to the voices of Opposition Members and in doing so committed that faulty legislation to the statute book? Following our discussion of this well-founded Bill on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I look forward to rectifying many of those mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) did not raise concerns and objections to the proposal in the sittings motions that we sit on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, afternoons and evenings. The hon. Gentleman and I were due to spend Thursday next week at a meeting of the commission that is considering the future role of the voluntary sector in Scotland. That is of considerable importance and interest to many hon. Members, but we shall be unable to attend and express our views if the sittings motion is passed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr is a member of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, which is considering community care and has a lot of ground to cover. I speak for Back Benchers who try to do a proper and thorough job in scrutinising legislation effectively, and removing Tuesdays and Thursdays will make it difficult for me and other hon. Members to do as the Minister suggested—to take the Bill seriously and to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
give it proper attention and scrutiny. The sittings motion will make it difficult for us properly to prepare to debate the Bill and to deal with the issues. Perhaps the Minister would consider lending members of the civil service to Back Benchers to help us to prepare briefs. I might even be prepared to accept briefs prepared for the Minister by the civil service.<br><br>
Without Tuesdays and Thursdays there will be little time during the remainder of the week to prepare for our discussion of the Bill. The hon. Member for Ayr said, "What about Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays?" Other Scottish Members are aware that Mondays are difficult days on which to prepare for our discussions because on every second Monday there is a Scottish Grand Committee. I was delighted to learn last night that the Scottish Grand Committee will sit on 25 November when the Secretary of State for Defence, for the first time, will dare to come to Fife and, hopefully, will provide some good news on the future of the dockyard. That is one Monday among many that will not be available for preparation for this Committee.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friends, I try to use Mondays and Fridays for constituency work. Yesterday there was no Scottish Grand Committee and I spent the day meeting the chief executive and chairman of Fife healthcare. I then judged more than 200 Christmas cards drawn by primary school children in my constituency who had decided to design a Christmas card for me to send out this year. That was a delightful but difficult competition to judge. Mondays are not available and that is one reason why we need time on Tuesdays and Thursdays to prepare for our discussion of the Bill.<br><br>
Many Scottish Members of Parliament use Fridays for constituency issues such as surgeries and meetings with local businesses and local interests. We do not spend Saturdays and Sundays putting our feet up: we may be speaking at conferences or holding surgeries. On Sunday, for example, I attended my local Armistice ceremony—I am sure that other hon. Members attended theirs—and took the time to go to the local Royal British Legion club where I talked to people most concerned about the issues affecting the country.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
All those factors mean that, if we meet all day on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it will be extremely difficult to prepare for the Bill and give it our serious attention.<br><br>
I have not mentioned Wednesdays. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister says that it is a shopping day. I am delighted that he has time to shop when he is at Westminster. I certainly do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A shopping day for wifies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that attitude speaks for itself and shows that the Minister feels that he can delegate such tasks to the fairer sex.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0021">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
My problem on Wednesdays is that I generally have to sit on two Select Committees. I sit on the European Legislation Select Committee, where we regularly receive a huge pile of paper to work through—which I have tended to try to deal with on a Tuesday—and the Procedure Select Committee.<br><br>
For all those reasons I plead to the Minister not to insist that we have two sittings on both a Tuesday and a Thursday. To do so would ensure that I and my hon. Friends, who want to give serious and informed attention to the Bill and to have a serious and informed debate, would be at a great disadvantage in finding any hours of the day properly to prepare ourselves.<br><br>
If the Minister would like to suggest that we should not hold so many Scottish Grand Committee meetings or to suggest to the Chairmen of the various Select Committees that they should not meet while we consider the Bill, I would be interested to listen to him. The Minister set us all an impossible task by expecting us properly to deal with the Bill because, if we spend most of our Tuesdays and Thursdays sitting here we shall not have time to prepare ourselves nor to listen to and read what our constituents and many interested organisations have to contribute.<br><br>
I admit that this is the first time that I have served on a Standing Committee that deals with criminal legislation. That means that I have much reading to catch up with if I am to ensure that I give proper attention to the serious matters relating to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire) has focused on days other than Committee days and we should be considering the days when it is proposed that the Committee sit. The Government assume that the Opposition can fit into their timetable on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It is all right for them because they have civil servants who scurry off and stand in for them. There are so few Scottish Conservative Members of Parliament that they cannot find colleagues to substitute for them, so it has to be the civil servants. Many organisations that expect to meet Conservative Members to discuss issues of importance in Scotland find themselves meeting with civil servants, who subsequently brief the Minister. The Opposition, however, are preparing for Government, so many people want to meet us to discuss matters and we cannot provide civil servants as substitutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has had the past 18 or 19 years to prepare for Government—keep preparing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New Labour is being treated seriously—the shadow Chancellor and the general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress were invited to address a dinner of the Confederation of British Industry. That change in attitude has occurred because people have had enough of the Government and want to talk to us instead.<br><br>
My timetable is full: I have many meetings with my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton about skills and training in Scotland, about youth and student
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
policy and about co-ordinating crime and drugs campaigns, and I have met all the chief-constables in Scotland. There are substantial demands on my time on Mondays and Fridays when I am in Scotland and on Tuesdays and Thursdays when I am here.<br><br>
During a debate on the Floor of the House, the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mr. Fabricant) referred to a book by Tolstoy called "War and Punishment". I have searched all the libraries in Britain to find that book—if it is so relevant that the hon. Gentleman felt obliged to mention it, I feel that I should consult it. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find that title listed under the works of Tolstoy or Dostoevsky.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend tried looking for a book called "Crime and Peace"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to think of all the permutations, and, in search of some gender wisdom, I have also tried looking for books called "Doctor Karenina" and "Anna Zhivago". [<i>Laughter.</i>] Perhaps I should confess that I stole that joke from my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson).<br><br>
It was insulting and disparaging of the hon. Member for Ayr to suggest that Labour Back Benchers hang around corridors waiting for mail to come from our constituencies so that we have something to do. I sit on European Standing Committee A, which deals with health and safety issues, among other matters. This morning's judgment against the Government—that the 48-hour working week rule should be enforced—is of interest to members of that Committee, as will be this Wednesday's debate on the labelling of beef products. Substantial paperwork is involved and we must put enough time into that work to do justice to the role of European Standing Committees. I also sit on the Select Committee for Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, which functions as the health service ombudsman. Over the next three weeks we have to consider a succession of trusts and health boards that have made errors and we need sufficient time to do so properly. The hon. Member for Ayr seems to think that we have all the time in the world to read every document that relates to the Bill. That might sum up his position as a Conservative Back Bencher, but Labour Back Benchers have a much more substantial role.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the trouble each week to prepare a diary to show to my constituents so that they know how many Committees I am involved in. I recognise that all Members of the House voluntarily took on an enormous workload, but, instead of mumping and moaning about it, we should get on with our parliamentary duty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point, and the hon. Gentleman's use of the phrase "parliamentary duty" is significant. The point is that the Government want to rush through a ragbag of ideological claptrap in the Bill, which is totally irresponsible. People who know about the effects of bad criminal legislation have not been given a chance to give us sensible, reasonable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
advice and we do not have an opportunity to do proper research or to meet the people who have something significant to tell us. The Government's strategy is deliberate, and the sittings motion makes that clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that that criticism comes ill from the hon. Member for Ayr, who admitted that the Government got it wrong in the previous crime Bill only a couple of years ago? That shows that the Committee should take its time, meet the relevant people and consider the relevant documents. Moaning about our lot is not the point—we are being sensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the hon. Member for Ayr, the old adage about fools and babes springs to mind. He clearly admitted that the Government got it wrong. I shall take the time to read the hon. Gentleman's contributions line by line, but I strongly doubt that he will attack the Government's stance or try to undermine their demands. I also wait with interest to see what the Government's official line will be. I notice that the Whip—whom I do not recognise; he obviously has not sat in on Scottish Questions before—is signalling to the hon. Gentleman to shut up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I might say that, during proceedings on a previous Bill, the Whip often looked at me to suggest that I should shut up because I was critical of a particular issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we have some time between sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We do not want the Government forcing us to have two sittings every Tuesday and then letting sittings run on late. But if they wish to do so, I expect to find some of their responses hard to take.<br><br>
During consideration of the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Bill, when we pleaded to have fewer sittings and more time for consideration, we had to learn on our feet. I recall that we had to analyse the paperwork on our feet so that it took an hour or two to make a contribution on what seemed like a simple amendment. I am not trying to warn the Government, but I feel an hour's speech coming on every time we have to debate matters that we are not given sufficient time to consider outside the Committee and when we do not have time to distil information from briefings and organisations—[<i>Interruption.</i>]<br><br>
To continue with my earlier point, time on Tuesdays and Thursdays is already in great demand. I have just looked at my electronic diary and notice that if we sit on Thursday evenings, the Church and Nation Committee, which is coming down from the Church of Scotland, will have to be given a bye, which would be an insult to that Committee. We have relevant commitments on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which we should be allowed to meet. If we sit at those times, I shall not be able to attend a meeting on Northern Ireland; a very important matter that I have given time to trying to understand and, hopefully, assist in by, among other things, chairing the Northern Ireland youth parliament, which I did in October last year. I would have to forgo a meeting on energy saving, which is very important to senior citizens, a meeting about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
provision for the Scottish homeless and, as treasurer for the all-party group for the chemical industries, I would have to withdraw from a meeting with those industries, which are so very important to my constituency and to Scotland, especially following the announcement that the landfall for the three new wells will be in Grangemouth. That will probably result in a doubling of output at the ethylene cracker plant and a potential 1,500 short-term jobs and 250 permanent jobs. If the Government insist that we have two sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I shall have to walk away from that.<br><br>
I have a particular interest in BBC radio and have supported the campaign to save the World Service from the crazes of Mr. Birt, but would also have to forgo a meeting about that. I would have to miss the environmental taxation seminar on Thursday, as well as a meeting with the Venture Capital Association, which wants to talk to new Labour and other people. As assistant to the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman for Scotland, I am preparing the training and skills brief, but I would have to forgo that meeting too. The Government are wrong to think that they plough the Bill through without thinking about the effects on other timetables. I ask the Government not to use the two sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays to push the legislation through quickly.<br><br>
Turning to the questions that we must research and discuss with other organisations, the on-going problem of Cornton Vale and the reaction of the Scottish Prison Officers Association must be teased out. From the beginning, I have been critical of the regime at Cornton Vale. I used to be a prison visitor there and I have spoken to the Scottish Prison Officers Association in the young offenders institute at Polmont. There have already been difficulties with transferring women from Cornton Vale into the young offenders institute and with transferring young male prisoners to Cornton Vale. I am on record and in print as saying that the problem lay with the prison regime. We must talk quietly to the Scottish Prison Officers Association behind closed doors and get its members honestly to analyse what went wrong with the regime so that the matter can be brought to the Committee's attention. Perhaps we could then introduce amendments to help in such situations. We cannot be satisfied that we know enough, are doing enough or have talked to people as we need to—quietly and behind closed doors, not through briefs that are sent here and read on to the record. We need to tease out the problems so that we can prevent the deaths of another five young women in 15 months. We should talk to organisations such as the Scottish Prison Officers Association and take them seriously.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
On Second Reading, I spoke about tagging. I am worried that tagging for people aged 16 and older is included in the Bill and that we shall not take any serious evidence about whether it is working. Experiments are ongoing in England and we should have longer to talk to the people who are analysing them before we take the issue further. We should seriously consider the Government's proposals.

Perhaps a further amendment would allow us to achieve what is intended—somehow to control and constrain people who might commit further crimes when out of surveillance. Tagging is not the only option and we need to talk to people seriously to transform a kneejerk reaction into serious legislation.<br><br>
In Glasgow—your city, Mr. Martin—the licensing board has decided to ban drinking in public places for everyone, not just young people. Previously, the target was to remove drink only from people who could not prove that they were older than 18 years. The Glasgow experiment should be analysed. We should seriously consider its effect on the city of Glasgow and on drink-related crime. We should talk to the people who introduced the experiment and to the police in Glasgow to tease out a serious amendment that would make a real impact. I made a plea for blanket legislation to ban drinking in the streets for all ages and I want the Government to consider all the organisations that might provide evidence about whether that would be a good or a bad idea and to introduce an amendment—or they could give us time to talk to the relevant organisations. If I am pressed to do all the things that I mean to on a Tuesday and Thursday on a Friday or a Monday, I do not know when I will have time to talk to people about such matters. That is why the sittings motion is over-harsh to demand that we have two or possibly three sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. As I recall, the late sitting can run until 4 o'clock in the morning, in the Committee Room it is the same day but outside in the Corridor it is the next day in this bizarre organisation. The Government would be wrong to use such time.<br><br>
On Second Reading, I spoke about offenders with mental disorders. We spoke to people during consideration of the 1993 Act, which might not be available to check line by line against other documents. We talked to Dr. John Baird who works at Carstairs and who gave us sensible advice. We should return to him and other experts to try and get the legislation right. If a person's mental disorder caused a crime, but the person has been cured and commits no further crimes, that is good. We must examine whether we can get evidence to redraft the clauses in a sensible manner, but we shall not have time to do that if we sit in Committee for two sessions every Tuesday and Thursday. If the Government try to block rational input into the Committee, they must be resisted. Therefore, there will be much discussion of relevant topics in Committee, based on paper evidence. That could mean that a lot of analysis is done in Committee, although it ought to be done outside, which is why I have some anxiety about the sittings motion.<br><br>
The Minister of State is a gentleman, who always tries to give us notice of relevant issues. He has provided a Government list, which runs to about 20 items, some of which are displayed on the Table and make a fair tome for analysis, if we are to do our job properly. The Opposition have no civil servants to back us up; we have to read all the items ourselves to try and bring the legislation together. As was remarked on Second Reading, massive legislation does not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
necessarily make a massive difference to the level of crime—if that were true, the Government would have buried crime under a huge pile of papers. However, those papers must be read and analysed. We must avoid another aggressive, yah-boo, political Committee stage in which the Government are set in their ideology and we oppose it on ideological grounds. We should talk to the relevant people and advance sound arguments. That might divert the Government from their present course of action and prevent them from making the errors that we suspect may be made if the sittings motion is passed. The Government should seriously consider the problems that may result from forcing through the Bill. There is a danger that we shall end up with much argument but little enlightenment. If we have sufficient time for relevant work outside the Committee, we shall be able to enlighten the debate and prevent the Government from making serious errors by rushing through the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I must apologise to the Committee for my late arrival—I did not hear the Minister move the sittings motion. However, I understand from my hon. Friend's comments that the Committee will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the mornings and afternoons—and in the evenings as well, I suspect. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister asks, from a sedentary position, where I was: I was being interviewed about the future of social democracy in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend should explain to the Minister what democracy means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that I should explain to the Minister what democracy—never mind social democracy—means.<br><br>
As I look at the conservative Benches I despair for the future of social democracy, because I see an array of people who are committed to undoing democracy, especially in Scotland. What depresses me is the fact that, although several Conservative Members of the Committee do not represent Scottish constituencies, they are considering legislation that will apply only to Scottish constituencies, which raises fundamental questions about democracy. However, because we will meet only on Tuesdays and Thursdays we shall not have time to debate democracy in Scotland or the role of Scottish Parliament. We should discuss whether the Bill should be considered by Scottish Members or by Members from east Surrey, or whichever constituency the Conservative Member of the Committee—who has popped up on every Committee dealing with Scottish legislation that I have served on—represents. He always sits on the Conservative Back Bench sneering and making comments. I should like to name him, but I have to confess that I do not know his name!<br><br>
I must address my remarks to the sittings motion. I am especially worried about sittings on Thursday evenings. Unlike the English Members of the Committee, some Opposition Members of the Committee have to get back to Scotland, and there are problems doing so on Thursday evenings.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where is the hon. Gentleman going on Thursday?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps interrupting me and disturbing my train of thought.<br><br>
It is hard for Scottish Members to get back to Scotland on Thursday evenings. It would help if I had to get back to Glasgow or Edinburgh, but I have to get back to Dundee and I have to make more complicated travel arrangements. For example, the train for Dundee, which goes direct from London to Dundee on Thursday evenings, leaves at 9 p.m. I do not mind the Thursday afternoon sitting between 4.30 p.m. and 7 p.m., but I should be very upset if the Minister insisted on returning again at 9 p.m. on those days. I would miss my train to Dundee—[HoN. MEMBERS: "Ah!"] That is a serious matter for me, if not for other Members of the Committee. They should take my interests into account, just as I take their interests into account.<br><br>
There is also a problem taking the aeroplane. If a sitting finished at 7 pm., some Opposition Members could get the 9 p.m. flight to Glasgow, but the last British Airways flight to Edinburgh leaves at 8 p.m.; I should have no chance of getting it and my car would be marooned at Edinburgh airport. I should have to get a night train to Edinburgh, hire a taxi for a £10 trip—which is a lot of money—to Edinburgh airport, pick up my car, drive back to Dundee, wash and change and only then get down to constituency engagements. There is a real problem for hon. Members from remote constituencies. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Conservative Members may sneer, but my constituents expect me to be in my constituency on a Friday morning and they expect me to appear at local engagements. Looking at my diary, I notice that I am expected to be at the graduation ceremony at Abertay University on Friday at 10 30 a.m., but I could not be there if the Committee met on the previous Thursday evening: it is as simple as that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: You can pair with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) says he will pair with me. As a matter of principle, I will not pair with Conservative Members. I will make sure that they are kept here for as long as possible. That is the role of the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the hon. Gentleman doing on Thursday?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will skulk away and not tell the hon. Gentleman and leave the Whip wondering where I am. This Friday is Abertay University graduation: next Friday I am at a Dundee college meeting parents; the Friday after that I have committed myself to opening a new wing at Grove academy in my constituency and the people there will be deeply disappointed if I do not turn up. The following Friday I am in London and would have no problem attending a sitting on Thursday evening—but one in four not being a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
problem is not a good enough ratio for me. I need to be back in my constituency on Fridays to be available to my constituents.<br><br>
Earlier, Mr. Martin, you mentioned the shape of the Committee. I must ask hon. Members whether, when they got up this morning and looked in the mirror, they were pleased with what they saw. The number of times that the Committee sits will affect its members' health.<br><br>
The Minister laughs, but the Jopling committee recommended that we should try to get away by Thursday evening so that hon. Members could return to their constituencies and have a night in their own beds. They should not have to travel overnight under pressure and see their health begin to deteriorate—nor should they have to sit on the train to Scotland in the bar drinking all night and then have to get up in the morning. That is very bad for one's health and the Jopling committee understood that.<br><br>
Hon. Members receive an annual health check and I attended mine recently. I was warned about the stress that I was placing myself under by trying to get back to Dundee overnight. They said, "Far better for you to get away early on a Thursday and get back to your bed." The hon. Minister for Eastwood does not understand that we cannot go to our beds if we are here until all hours in the morning. I remember sitting on Committees with the hon. Gentleman until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. I remember one dreadful occasion when the Committee went right through until 1 o'clock on a Wednesday because there was no agreement between the Whips. It was so absurd that in here it was Tuesday and out in the Corridor it was Wednesday: if we went to the toilet we travelled in time to Wednesday and then came back to Tuesday when we returned to the Room. It was pathetic. That is why it is important for hon. Members to return to their constituencies. Everyone has constituency engagements this Thursday. I have other engagements this Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a tribal event that takes place periodically in Glasgow. As I represent a Dundee constituency I have no direct interest in it, but I am a season ticket holder at Parkhead and I would like to be there on Thursday. If that failed, I could always watch it on the Sky Sports channel in my office but I would prefer to be there in person as would, I am sure, several other members of the Committee. The Minister, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), keeps it a state secret but he supports the opposite side to me in Thursday's struggle. He does not want people in Aberdeen to know that he is a hun. Like the Minister, I was born and raised in Glasgow and so I am quite open about my allegiance—which, as one might guess, is not to Rangers. Those are personal reasons why it would suit me if the Committee did not meet on this Thursday in particular. I am happy to spend the other Thursdays locked up here but this Thursday I would like to get away.<br><br>
If you have read the Order Paper this week, Mr. Martin, you will have noticed that I have just been appointed to the European Legislation Select
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0025">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
Committee. That Committee has an onerous task to do. I am sure that there is a massive amount of reading with which I shall have to catch up to keep pace with my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West.<br><br>
My onerous duties will include a visit to the country that takes over the presidency—I believe that the Committee will be visiting Holland in the next couple of weeks. I might have to refuse to go on that fact-finding mission but I certainly would like to go. There is also an annual visit to Brussels and a massive amount of reading. That work will be damaged if I am tied up with this Committee's proceedings every Tuesday and Thursday trying to keep up with all the work that is involved here as well as coming to terms with the work that is involved in the European Legislation Select Committee.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) for faxing me a list of books or, as he described them, relevant documents, which we all have to read if we want to make a meaningful contribution to the Committee's proceedings.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East said that there are 20 documents. In fact, 27 are listed by the Minister as being relevant. How many members of the Committee can put up their hands and say honestly that they have read all the documents and understand their implications and relevance? No one in the Committee can say that. If we were seriously considering the Bill, we would take time to sit and read all the documents to judge their relevance to the Bill. None of us, if we are honest, will do that and the Bill will not be properly debated in the Committee because the Government are not allowing sufficient time to debate it.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
My hon. Friends and I are being inundated with briefs from various organisations that are interested in the Committee's work. I have here a speech which the Minister will have to read at some point. It may not be a very good speech, but it may be relevant to what we are debating in the Committee. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is sending an ever-increasing number of briefs on different parts of the Bill which will have to be read. The Law Society of Scotland has written to me, as has Homestat UK, although that has nothing to do with the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend continues, those of us with many years experience of such Committees will recognise that it is the Opposition who take the trouble to try to read the documents? It will soon be Christmas card writing time and Conservative Members are likely to be found ploughing through stacks of Christmas cards and attending the Committee only to vote. The Minister is looking indignant. Does that mean that we shall see not a single Conservative Member signing Christmas cards in the Committee in the coming weeks? If that is so, it will be unique.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point which relates particularly to Conservative Members who represent English constituencies and who are unlikely to make any contribution to the work of the Committee, other than voting to ensure that the Government get their own way. They will not say why they vote as they do because most of them will not listen to the debates and will not know what the arguments are. They will sit outside the Room with their secretaries and write Christmas cards. That is another reason for not sitting on Thursday afternoons—when will I be able to write 250 Christmas cards? I may be travelling on Thursdays, but I do not yet know.<br><br>
The Portland Group is sending comments on the clauses that cover under-age drinking and must be considered. The hon. Member for Ayr will have an advantage when we discuss the clauses covering drugs. He had the opportunity of visiting Hanger 13, which I believe has now closed. He went to the scene and spoke to people there. He understands the problem far better as a result. We have not had that opportunity, but we would like to take advantage of such opportunities to become involved.<br><br>
The Bill is complex with six parts. Part I has five subheadings, part II has two, part III has two, part IV has one, part V has three, and part VI has two. All must be properly considered by the Committee. The Government want to rush the Bill through and to make us tired by having us sitting here at 2 o'clock in the morning with red eyes from lack of sleep, dying to get to our beds and not concentrating on the issues before the Committee. That is how they want to deal with this important Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Government are simply suggesting, as did the hon. Member for Dumbarton, that we sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays, mornings and afternoons. They have not imposed a guillotine or timetable. We are discussing issues that are not relevant to the Bill and it would be better if we got stuck into clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For someone who has been in Parliament since 1992, the hon. Gentleman shows a dramatic lack of understanding of the way in which the place works. Process is important and the way we handle the sittings motion will affect how we handle the Bill. The hon. Gentleman believes that we shall meet only in the mornings and afternoons. Has he been a Member of a Standing Committee before? The afternoon sitting does not finish at 7 o'clock. The Whip will get up to move that the Committee adjourns until 9 o'clock. At half-past 11 he will get up again to adjourn until 12 o'clock and then continue with half hour breaks thoughout the night. that is how the procedure works. Our sittings will not be just in the mornings and afternoons. They will continue throughout the night and I am arguing that that is not the way in which to deal with important legislation—[<i>Interruption</i>].</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I will tell the hon. Member for Ayr what the problem is—I cannot hear the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Martin, that is one of the advantages of being in the Chair.<br><br>
I am not sure whether this is in order, but I have noted the financial effects of the Bill. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"There will be no significant increase in Prison Service manpower, as new prisons will be privately financed."</p></blockquote>
It may be sophistry, but I believe that if new prisons are to be built under the private finance initiative, they will be paid for by the taxpayer. The new private warders will be in the new private prisons, but they will be paid for by the taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think the hon. Gentleman was closer to the sittings motion when he discussed the football on Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will go back to the football match if you like, Mr. Martin—I am confident that, on Thursday, Celtic will do very well.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr wants to get on with it. He wants to rush the Bill through, just as the Government do because they do not want a proper debate. But the process by which the Committee addresses the Bill is just as important as the Bill's content. If we do not give it quality scrutiny, we will end up with bad legislation. The hon. Gentleman should know that. He has been supporting a Government for the past 17 years who have a world record in passing bad legislation. They always take the same attitude and say, "Let's use our majority to force through whatever we want. Let's bludgeon it through. We'll sit up all night if necessary. We'll keep people here and run them ragged, but we'll get the Bill through at all costs." That is not the way to legislate. That is how we got the poll tax and the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which the Government are trying to reverse with this Bill. What will happen? God spare us if they get back in after the election—they will introduce another Bill to reverse this one.<br><br>
Let us give the Bill quality scrutiny—that is all Opposition Members want—so that when we discuss the Bill we are alert, know what we think and are not tired or wanting to be somewhere else dealing with pressing engagements that pull us out of Committee to answer phones and deal with constituency problems. If we focus on the work of the Committee, we will be able to spot the Bill's faults. Although civil servants are marvellous people—I am sure that you, Mr. Martin, would not let me knock them in any way—they are human and make mistakes. There will be drafting errors. The Government will make political mistakes—they will not have thought through properly some aspects of the Bill. Are we to discuss the Bill at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning? Would any civilised person anywhere in Europe think for a second that an open-ended commitment to meet all through the night is the correct way to deal with important legislation? Is that what the Government are saying? Would the hon. Gentleman go back to Ayr and tell his constituents that he forced through a Bill, he did not give proper consideration to it and he thinks that that is the right way to deal with important
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
legislation? Of course he would not, so let us be honest. Let us suggest that, at least for this week, we will not meet in the evenings.<br><br>
As for the Special Standing Committee, I take the point made by Conservative Members that we did not make such a request on Second Reading, but, as hon. Members know, that was not a decision made by any Labour member of the Committee—we have to accept what our leadership decides to do. But not having a Special Standing Committee does not remove the wisdom of us taking time to visit various groups that will be affected by the Bill.<br><br>
Cornton Vale was mentioned, but it is not the only prison that will be affected—every prison in Scotland will be affected by the new regime introduced by the Bill. Hon. Members would like to visit prisons nearer them to find out what people there think about the Bill and the idea of one-sixth remission or, as the Secretary of State for Scotland put it on Second Reading, the idea that if someone is put away, he should stay away. That is an appalling thing for anyone, especially a Secretary of State, to say; he plunged the depths of politicking on a very serious issue. I want to know what prison warders everywhere think about that attitude; how they think the regime will operate in the prisons; what effect it will have on the inmates; whether it will encourage good order in prisons or lead to a breakdown in order in prisons across Scotland. That is an important point. I do not know the answers and I challenge anyone in this Room to say that they know them. How will we find the answers? We need to get to the prisons and talk to the people there who are responsible for looking after them. We cannot bring them here to give evidence because it is not possible to have a Special Standing Committee. If we do not meet as frequently as the sittings motion suggests, we could take time to visit prisons in Scotland and meet people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point about prisons, which is extremely important, the hon. Gentleman will probably have heard about the case last week of a man who was found guilty of raping two young girls and sent to Peterhead prison for life. It was reported on the news this morning that he committed suicide, which highlights the fact that the issue of supervision and care in prisons is extremely important. Our charge against the Government is that they rush legislation through when it is time that they visited prisons in order to understand the system. That incident is just the latest example, which begs huge questions that the Government must answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. There has been much joking during our debate on the sittings motion, which is normal in Committee, but this is a serious issue. If we do not take time to handle the Bill properly but rush it through, such issues will not be addressed. Indeed, it may be possible for both sides to reach some agreement. As long as the Government say that they are prepared to give the Bill time for proper consideration, I am sure that the Opposition would be happy seriously to consider the Bill in accordance with a timetable that is acceptable to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. But
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0027">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
the Government are not saying that. They are saying that they will force it through at their pace, which is dictated not by what is good for the prison service in Scotland, but by what will be good for the Tory party in the coming general election. They are making cheap political points and trying to appear tough on law and order without thinking through the implications of that tough policy. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton is right; people's lives may turn on this. How we debate the Bill may determine whether people lose their lives in prison. Therefore, it must be considered seriously.<br><br>
I understand that there will be an opportunity to table new clauses. I do not know whether it is in order to mention this now, but the Bill includes nothing about secure units for people under 16. That may open up a new debate about secure units, but how many hon. Members have actually visited a secure unit in Scotland and spoken to the teachers and social workers who work there to find out what they think of the system and how it should be changed? That is the essence of it. We are locked up, four days a week, in this anachronism called Parliament, and we forget that there is a real world out there. But whatever happens in here has an impact on the real world. We must take time to go out into the real world and find out what ordinary people think about the measures that the Committee will vote on.<br><br>
If hon. Members sit in Committee writing their Christmas cards or reading their constituency mail and not listening to the debate, but simply voting in accordance with what the Whip tells them, they let down their constituents and themselves. Members of Parliament have a very responsible job. It is our duty to ensure that we take time to address the issues raised by the Bill, which I do not believe we are doing.<br><br>
The social work department of Dundee city council has sent me a list, which shows that there are 49 social workers in Dundee dealing with criminal justice issues. I would like to have time to speak to all 49 of them, but I do not suppose that I shall. I have a list of their names but I shall desist from reading it to the Committee. There are some aspects of social work of which I am sure most members of the Committee are not even aware. The list includes something called the airborne Initiative—taking young offenders away and sending them into the air—which I should like to have time to discuss. It is a very worthwhile project that is an alternative to locking them up. The Committee should be discussing that initiative but the Government will not allow us to do so—unless, of course, we discuss it in the middle of the night.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr mentioned that we have Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. As has already been said, Monday is not a good day for hon. Members to work on the Bill. It is a constituency day, for which hon. Members already have a series of engagements that prevent them from making the necessary visits. In addition, hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies have to travel from Scotland, which takes time. I realise that English
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
Members will not understand that because they can jump on a tube and be here within an hour or half an hour. But it can take Scottish Members seven or eight hours travelling to get to the House in time to vote. Sometimes there is a vote at 7 o'clock and there is nearly always a vote at 10 o'clock so we have to take the time to travel. Therefore, Mondays are out for us. An hon. Member mentioned our going home on Wednesdays. Has he spoken to the Chancellor about that? Think of the expense of travelling down on Monday to be here on Tuesday, jumping on the train or the plane to go back to Scotland on Wednesday, then jumping on the train or plane to come back down on Thursday. Is that what the hon. Gentleman suggests—that more taxpayers' money be used just because the Goevernment are not prepared to spend a wee bit extra time in Committee to debate various issues? Fridays have already been dealt with.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West said that Australia had dealt well with many of the problems which arise in the Bill. I do not suggest that the Committee adjourn to Australia or take the time to go to Australia to look at how the legislation works, but it would be nice to take the time to visit the Australian embassy and speak to the ambassador to find out what he thinks about the justice system that has been introduced in Australia.<br><br>
There are any number of reasons to take our time on the Bill and give it serious consideration. I had not read the amendments until this morning, but we are expected to debate and vote on them immediately without having time properly to consider them or to consult those who will be affected by them. That is not a good way to make legislation and I suspect that it is not how other legislation is made.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East was absolutely right that such attitudes lead to non cooperation. I remember him making a speech that lasted an hour and 15 minutes about the significance of the word "the" in a clause. We all made equally long speeches. Is that what we must descend to? Must we end up filibustering—although you, Mr. Martin, will not allow us to filibuster—because there is no co-operation and the two sides will not agree about how to deal with an important piece of legislation? We end up taking a lot of time over matters that could be dealt with more quickly. I just want co-operation and for hon. Members to see the matter both ways for a change and to allow people to have a point of view and express it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talked about amendments and the detailed scrutiny that can arise in Committee and may result in speeches which last in excess of an hour. Did he respond as I did when he saw the list of amendments? Does he agree that if we are to consider this number of amendments to clause 1 alone, it is clear that the Bill will require very detailed scrutiny and that attempts to rush matters through will be totally counter-productive?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. The amendments go through to clause 12, but that is on the initial selection list only.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman believes that the Bill is so important that we need a lot of time, the sooner we start to address the issues, the better. As he knows from his experience in Committee—as the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham) does not—we get plenty of time. There is not a problem in Committee. The problem is getting started. The hon. Gentleman is fililbustering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With all respect to the hon. Gentleman, the problem is not getting started; the problem is the process that we will adopt to examine the Bill—the process suggested by the Government in the sittings motion is not good enough. I am looking forward to mentioning the airborne initiative because I am sure that the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) would be able to contribute due to his wide experience as a pilot, which earned him the nickname Biggles. He would be able to provide us with an enlightened insight about whether the initiative is good, but that will not happen if we adopt the Government's attitude and have confrontation from day one.<br><br>
We are trying to persuade the Government to think again. Let us spin the matter out a bit and take our time. Why is there such a rush? A general election is due and could be announced at any time, so we are not even guaranteed that the Bill will see the light of day on the statute book. We are rushing the Bill for political reasons—party political reasons. That is the point that we are trying to make. We want to take the time because the sittings motion is important. I am not delaying or filibustering, but trying to convince the Government that their approach is wrong and that we should take more time for all Committee members properly to consider the Bill. I know that the hon. Member for North Tayside is under instructions not to Speak—that is how Governments work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know by now that there is no one in Parliament who can instruct me one way or the other. I should have thought that my record, and his, would convince him that we are both independent spirits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of regret that no one in Parliament can instruct the hon. Gentleman not to speak—it would be lovely if we could. If members of the Committee examine the <i>Hansard</i> record of the proceedings of any Committee they will find that the government—be they Conservative or Labour— make far less of a contribution to a debate on a Bill than do the Opposition. The nature of this Parliament is that the Opposition have to do all the running. It is in the Government's interest to pass the legislation quickly and to get it on the statute book with the minimum amount of change. That is what is wrong with the way in which this Parliament legislates. The Government do not start from the basis that they want good legislation but from the basis that they want their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
own way whatever the cost. They are prepared to have absurd sittings motions that will mean that we have to debate until all hours in the morning and waste our time. Such motions cause the Opposition to turn around and say, "Right, if we are not going to get Government co-operation, we will not co-operate with them; we'll slow down and take every opportunity to table amendments that may or may not be important. We'll take up parliamentary time and make them fight every inch of the way to get the Bill on the statute book." Would not it be better to behave differently?<br><br>
Ours is a quality Committee: many of its members have something worthwhile to contribute on the subject of crime and punishment in Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) has been the lodestar against drug barons in her constituency. It is important that when we come to discuss clause 2 we have access to her insight. Because of the absurd sittings motion, however, she may not be here—which would be to the detriment of all members of the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross has three prisons in her constituency. She could make an important contribution when we discuss those clauses that relate to prisons—but she may not be here either because of constituency engagements that prevent her from complying with the sittings motion.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill will be in a similar position. She has a magnificent record on debating women's issues and the effects on women of crime and punishment in Scotland. She is chairperson of the Scottish all-party parliamentary group on children and could make an important contribution to our proceedings. We should make it easy for those hon. Members to be present in the Committee so that they can contribute to the debate instead of setting up a system where there is a risk that they will not be able to attend our proceedings when we debate those important issues.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr is always worth a laugh, if nothing else. We would like him to be present and to make contributions, but I understand that he tried unsuccessfully to be paired this morning so that he could appear on a Granada Television programme. I hope that he will continue to be unsuccessful if he tries to go on television. Opposition Members of the Committee are getting a bit sick of turning on the television in Scotland and finding the hon. Member for Ayr on it. No other Conservatives seem prepared to go on television these days. The hon. Gentleman seems to speak for the Conservative party. The right hon. Member for Dumfries is rarely seen speaking up for the Conservative party—I can understand that because he does not agree with what it says. The hon. Member for Eastwood has been keeping a very low profile—and the Conservative party tries to keep the profile of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) very low.<br><br>
It is important that we provide every member of the Committee with the chance to contribute to those important debates. The Minister of State is a reasonable man although he may not seem it because he does not stray from the brief and sticks to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0029">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
Government policy. In his heart of hearts, however, we all know that he does not agree with the principles in the Bill because he is a civilised and humane man.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a point about the hon. Member for Ayr. I have been involved in a few events with him and I must mention another issue: lack of scrutiny. Only a couple of weeks ago, the Minister of State was supposed to be on a BBC show, but the Government would not put him up: they kept him hidden in his office and put on the hon. Member for Ayr instead. That means that we are not even allowed to hear the Government's view on the airwaves and the television.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. As the Committee's proceedings develop over the next six months—or however long it takes to complete our discussions on the legislation—it will be interesting to notice how often the Minister of State strays from his brief. Opposition members of the Committee respect him: we believe him to be a decent man with decent instincts. Because he is Minister of State, however, when he reads the civil service brief, which has been written under the scrutiny of the Secretary of State for Scotland—with every word vetted to make sure that it is in line with Government policy—the Minister gets his head down and if anyone intervenes he says, "I'll write to the hon. Member". That means that the Secretary of State will reply because the Minister cannot trust himself to say what he thinks. I think that he would make a good new Labour Minister, although I am not holding out that prospect if we win the next election because I do not think that he will keep his seat—a Liberal Democrat will probably take it.<br><br>
There is a civilised and an uncivilised way of dealing with legislation. We always opt for the uncivilised way because we believe in the majoritarian view that whoever has the majority on the Committee can force through any idiocy that they wish simply through force of numbers. That is what is likely to happen with this Bill, and it begins with the sittings motion. The Minister may even save his seat if he stands up and says what he thinks instead of what he is told to say by his advisers in the Scottish Office—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is running out of stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it time to sit down? I am running out of stuff, but I am still good for half an hour—has it been half an hour yet?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Surely it is wrong for any member of the Committee to be instructed to speak for a set period of time? That cuts across all the principles of honest parliamentary and Committee debate. If the hon. Gentleman made that comment in all seriousness, it is a disgrace.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From where I was sitting, I did not think that it was a serious comment—it was lighthearted. Knowing the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), I am sure that no one could tell him what to do or what to say—far from it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one will tell me what to say—least of all, as has been said, the Labour party.<br><br>
I believe that I have put across what I think about the sittings motion. Hon. Members have pressing engagements elsewhere and although we want to take the Committee seriously, we will be able to do so only if we are allowed to attend other engagements, especially those that take place at half-past seven on a Thursday night in Glasgow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the fact of it, people outside this place might think that when the Government propose that we meet on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and afternoons, we will spend that time considering the Bill. But our experience of Committees has shown us that the proposal is not about that at all—it is simply about the Government rushing legislation through without us having time to scrutinise it properly.<br><br>
I understand the Government's view. There are three Scottish Office Ministers—although one has left the Room—and several hon. Members representing English constituencies, who clearly do not want to be here. The Scottish Office is almost empty—only the Secretary of State is left there. The Government desperately want the Bill pushed through and out of here as quickly as possible. What they do not want is to scrutinise it; they have made up their minds what they want. They have probably taken a week to create one paper, which they have thumped on the table saying, "Let's get in and out of here as quickly as possible because need to be in other places."<br><br>
I can understand that hon. Members who represent English constituencies want to be out of here, although I wonder about hon. Members who can devote this amount of time to legislation that will not affect their constituencies. However, it is difficult for us to find that time; we heard my hon. Friend's explanations of how hard it is to take that time out of our constituency duties and our other duties here. However, it must be even more difficult if the Bill does not relate to a Member's constituency. We mentioned people being told when to speak and when not, and being press ganged. How many of the English Conservative members of the Committee were press ganged into being on the Government Benches today, and how many volunteered? If there were volunteers, why do they want to be here when the Bill does not relate to their constituencies? That defeats me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Maybe it has something to do with the size of the majorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Adams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might well have something to do with that, but far be it for me to suggest it.<br><br>
I must tell the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, that Wednesday is not when the wifies shop—Thursday is late-night shopping, as he should know. It is important to the wifies here that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0030">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
get out on Thursday evenings. We are only six weeks from Christmas and we have a lot of shopping to do and all the extra money from our wage increase to spend. I am sure that Thursday evening will be important to the Minister this week because he will be desperate to get up to Parkhead.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
I am concerned about the lack of time to meet people who have something to say about the Bill. I am disappointed that this is not a Special Standing Committee. The evidence taken for the Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill, which related to raves, changed the Minister's mind about the first clause. It would have been particularly helpful if this Committee had been a Special Standing Committee, but the decision has been made and we cannot have a Special Standing Committee, so we must make our own arrangements to meet all the people we should hear before making the decisions that will be necessary on the Bill.<br><br>
This is an elastoplast exercise by the Government. They have got things so wrong for the past 17 and a half years that they are now desperate to put something on the statute book before the general election. They know what a mess they have made. I have almost worn a path to the Minister's door on crime, punishment and our difficulties in Scotland. I am sory that we shall not have time to discuss the issues. I beg the Minister to reconsider the time that we shall sit in the Committee trying to rush the Bill through and trying to impose rules on people, and to give us more time to get out and meet those who have something to say about the Bill.<br><br>
I am concerned about Thursday evenings because I am in the middle of meeting people who have been witnesses in key trials. The Minister knows that one of our biggest problems with serious crime is to get witnesses to come forward. Witnesses are often so intimidated that they are frightened to come forward. It has been a slow process in my constituency to try to persuade people to come forward and to set up witness protection with the police. We were successful in a trial about a month ago, but we must now return to the witnesses to discover the aspects that affected them and what made them stand their ground. During that trial, I spent four hours in my constituency office with one man who was a witness and who was too frightened to go out into the street because the people who were on trial had sent someone round to his house the night before to tell him that if they did not shoot him, they would shoot his 16-year-old son or his mother. He was given a choice. He could give evidence and deal with the consequences. That man did not leave my office until I had managed to have him taken into police protective custody. Those are the sort of people with whom we must speak.<br><br>
One man comes in every Friday morning. We are preparing a paper from a witness's perspective that we hope to present to the Lord Advocate. That man went through the trial as a key witness and he has many criticisms to make. There are lessons for us to learn from that. If we cannot convict people, we need not worry about the sort of punishment that they could be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
given. The greatest deterrent is for offenders to know that they will be caught and will have to go through the process with witnesses coming forward safe in the knowledge that they will be protected.<br><br>
We have not decided what that protection should be. Other aspects must be considered and discussed with local authorities because of the effect on their housing policies. When police ask for witnesses to be moved, the matter must be discussed with COSLA because more than one local authority may be affected. It must be discussed with witnesses to see where things went wrong and how the position can be improved. It must be discussed with the police to find out how things can be improved from their point of view. We shall not have time for any of that. If I am here on Thursday nights, I cannot do even my part because I shall probably not be in my constituency.<br><br>
Because my constituency has had all those problems, I rarely leave my office on Friday evening before 8.30 p.m. It will now be midnight, if I am still to see the people who I was supposed to see in the first instance. If I cannot get to Scotland until lunchtime on Friday, I will have to run into the weekend. All hon. Members, especially the Scots, have problems with travelling backwards and forwards and our weekends are already packed with other constituency engagements. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) shakes his head—perhaps he does not have those problems. If not, why not? Is it just that he has civil servants running around the place working for him.<br><br>
I know that the Minister will be desperate to get in Committee and out again because of other duties. He probably does not want to be here in the first place. Fine, but allow those of us who want to be here the time to scrutinise legislation. We do not want the same mess as three years ago. The Government now admit quite openly that they got that legislation entirely wrong. They will get it entirely wrong again if they do not listen to the people at the sharp end such as prison officers, the police, social workers and witnesses.<br><br>
The Government are partaking in an exercise in political propaganda. They have to have something with which to face the electorate because they are being crucified in Scotland for not taking crime as seriously as they should have done during the past 17 years and for giving us crime rates such as we have never experienced before.<br><br>
Now they have the chance to redress some of their mistakes, but it looks as if they will not take it. They are concerned only with spending Tuesday and Thursday mornings and afternoons passing as many clauses as they can. It does not matter what is in the clauses or what effect they will have on people's lives. What matters is that the Government can push them through so that hon. Members can get out of Committee to get on with writing their Christmas cards and Ministers can return to the Scottish Office. For all the good that they are doing there, they would be as well sitting here, desperate to get back there.<br><br>

We need proper time to scrutinise the legislation and interview all those concerned—individually if we are not to do it collectively. We do not need another piece of legislation on the statute book that gets the issue completely wrong again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a practical point about the arrangements for the Committee: I cannot be the only one who, at 12.23 pm, is colder than when I arrived at 10.30 am. If the Committee is expected to meet in this Room throughout the winter months, especially in the morning, I hope that arrangements will be made to ensure that there is a modicum of warmth. Otherwise, a special allowance will have to be provided so that we can all buy thermal underwear and extra-heavy overcoats. I am physically shivering and, frankly, I do not find that appropriate. If we must sit through Committee in the cold—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I came here at 10.15 am and told the House authorities that the Room was far too cold. I hope that they will take on board what has been said. It is ridiculous that the Room is not properly heated for the Committee to conduct its affairs. I hope that the problem will be rectified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, Mr. Martin. As I said, I am physically shivering. It is quite difficult to think clearly if, for part of the time, I am in discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I be chivalrous and offer the hon. Lady my jacket?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his chivalry, but I think that he and I have been seen together far too often in television studios for me to add to the gossip that might arise were I to be seen wearing articles of his clothing, for whatever reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Adams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would be even more embarrassed to be seen in the hon. Lady's clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. The hon. Lady is quite right.<br><br>
I listened with interest to many of the comments that have been made. The hon. Member for North Tayside mentioned my inexperience. I thank him for drawing the Committee's attention to that because this is my first major Committee although, last year, I sat on the Committee that considered what was colloquially known as the rave Bill. Some hon. Members may remember that that Committee principally consisted of sittings to take evidence and one ordinary sitting. At that point, the Government introduced a new clause, which entirely changed the legislation, so this is my first experience of a substantive Committee. Therefore, it was with considerable astonishment that I discovered—rather late in the day and some time after I had agreed to serve on the Committee—that the Committee was expected to meet on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and afternoons, and that the afternoon sittings started so late that they would clearly go on into the evening. That seems to be an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
utterly ludicrous timetable and I do not understand why Committees are driven in that fashion. There will be many practical problems—some of which have been referred to by hon. Members—in dealing with such complex legislation in the timetable that has been set. I say that given my background as a lawyer, but I note in passing that a teaching background would equip me rather better for long periods of time on my feet. Notwithstanding people's perceptions, a background as a lawyer tends to incline one towards brevity. However, it is my experience as a solicitor in local government and in private practice and as a member of the Bar that leads me to view this legislation with concern due to its complexity. Several different areas are canvassed in the Bill, which is really a number of pieces of legislation wrapped into one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may be interested to know that, in three Parliaments, my right hon. Friend the Minister and I served more hours in Standing Committees than any other hon. Members in the House. I assure her that the timetable that has been set is the standard timetable for Committees, and we can deal with the legislation in detail if we get on with the job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Member for North Tayside, the history of legislation dealing with law and order and crime and punishment in this Parliament is not a happy one. I would have expected the Government to learn by now that the procedures by which such legislation becomes law should be changed. The Bill will supersede some legislation on the statute book that is only just coming into effect. It seems extraordinary to me that we cling to procedures that have clearly failed in the past. We all agree that law and order is of the utmost importance to all our constituents so it does not seem sensible to cling to procedures that have been proven not to produce good law. That is what the hon. Member for Ayr implied when he said that he was critical of the 1993 legislation. Perhaps, if the hon. Member for Ayr had had longer to deal with that legislation in the run-up to its introduction, we would not have got into such a mess.<br><br>
Therefore, we must seriously consider the procedures and decide whether they will produce good legislation. That is presumably why we are here. If it is not, we may as well wrap up and go away after one sitting. It is important for us to have the necessary time to do the necessary work. That includes dealing with unsolicited briefings that we received through the post. For example, I have come across briefings this morning of which I have not had prior sight.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
I spent some time this weekend on the Internet—one can gain much useful information by spending time on it. For example, I found a paper produced by the Prison Reform Trust about the American experience of mandatory minimum sentences. It contained much useful information and, as all members of the Committee will agree, that subject is germane to our debate. I had not seen the paper before, and I found it only because I was able to spend time on the Internet. I fear that we will not have the time to dig out similarly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0032">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
useful information that might help us in our deliberations. It is a failure of any legislative process if it does not make the necessary time available. To tie up Tuesday mornings and evenings and Thursday mornings and evenings—and to leave us unable to do preparatory work during those times—will, I suspect, result in bad legislation reaching the statute book. We should prevent that from happening.<br><br>
I have aready mentioned my experience as a lawyer. As I said, I worked in local government, private practice and at the Bar, and I experienced what happens when legislation that has not been examined properly reaches the statute book. Time and again in my career I have had to tease through pieces of legislation. If care had been taken when the legislation was passing through Parliament, the resulting problem might have been avoided. I know from painful practice about what happens when the House gets it wrong, which, unfortunately, it does all too often. The main reason for that is that it considers matters in the context of politics rather than of reasoned debate, which means that legislation reaches the statute book when it should not do so.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East is rightly worried about the fact that the shortage of time means that preparatory work will not be done, The number of amendments to clause 1 that have been tabled is significant. The amendments that appear in my name are there for a very good reason—each of them can be argued for. That is how our discussion of the Bill should proceed but it is clear that insufficient time will be available to consider it in the necessary detail. It is enormously important that the right length of time is made available.<br><br>
May I add my voice to those of other Opposition Members who have discussed travel problems? Scottish Members should be able to guarantee that they will be in their constituencies on Monday evenings and Fridays, but the sittings motion will not make that possible.<br><br>
Again, I agree with the hon. Member for Dundee, East—I do not know whether that does him more harm than it does me—about the fact that the considerable distances that Scottish Members have to travel causes practical problems. The hon. Gentleman mentioned being forced to sit in the bar of the overnight train and the dreadful effects on his health that ensued. I would not for one minute pretend to have experience of the bar on the sleeper to Scotland. My experience of that service has made me aware that to call it a sleeper is a complete misnomer. The resulting state of an individual's arrival at the other end makes it impossible to do much work on a Friday because he or she is so exhausted. Keeping that up over a period of time will be very difficult.<br><br>
Many members of the Committee want to make every effort to be in Scotland in their constituencies on Fridays. I understand that Conservative Members representing Scottish constituencies, with their unionist credentials, may not be greatly concerned whether they are at home in Scotland, but I assure them that it is of great concern to myself and other Opposition Members that we get that opportunity
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
which will, it appears, be badly cut into by the Committee's proceedings. Time in Scotland is important for all of us because it is the people of Scotland who will be affected by the Bill. I an not the only one here who has had to rejig a diary completely in anticipation of the Committee's sittings. We do our constituents no favours by proceeding in this fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can sum up relatively briefly. The speech of the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross struck a nostalgic note when she said that legislation has to be properly drafted. I recall that her predecessor fought a one-man war over the years against parliamentary draftsmen in the belief that he could improve enormously their use of the English language.<br><br>
Many important points were raised this morning. There are a considerable number of important issues that we must do justice to in the Committee. We will have appropriate discussions through the official channels, taking account of the significant points made. I reassure the Hon. Member for Dumbarton that the necessary Acts will be available. The copies on the Table represent the legislation relevant to part I of the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of prisons overcrowding. We will discuss that. We are committed to providing the necessary places, but at the same time we want to ensure that minor offenders do not go to prison but carry out community service orders and supervised attendance orders. Restriction of liberty orders are part of that category because they will avoid the need to send those concerned to prison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister make a statement with regard to prisons and Brian Geddes, who was mentioned earlier and who committed suicide at 7 o'clock this morning in, I believe, Aberdeen prison? I realise that it is short notice and if he cannot, will he write to us quickly? Opposition Members are very concerned about supervision in prisons and possible staffing shortages which have been brought to our attention by individuals in the Scottish prison service and elsewhere. I ask the Minister for a speedy response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have called for a report on that, as the hon. Gentleman would expect. I understand that it will automatically go to a fatal accident inquiry. I have not yet received the report, but I shall be looking into the matter thoroughly.<br><br>
Some 93 per cent. of participants in the poll taken by the <i>Daily Record</i> were in favour of the early release proposals in the Bill, so reflecting the strong public support. The Maguire case, which we will refer to when we debate part I, emphasised in a clear and decisive way the need for further protections.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East referred to the Bill as a rag-bag of ideological claptrap. That is not what the public of Scotland believe. They think it is extremely important that the necessary protections are put in place. Conservative Members have no reluctance to legislate when the issues at stake involve the safety of our countrymen. There will be relevant

discussions through the official channels and we will take account of all the issues that have been raised this morning.<br><br>
I should mention that we are talking about a few extra hours. What are a few extra hours to Members of Parliament when weighed in the balance against the safety of our countrymen? There are major law and order measures to be determined and we intend to do them justice. We will have discussions on the most appropriate timings and take account of the interests of members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Minister has not addressed the specific question I asked in my brief contribution. Why is there nothing in the Bill to deal with rape cases in court to ensure that those who are guilty do not get away with it? [<i>Interruption.</i>] No, I am sorry but we are not discussing the sittings motion but a specific measure that should be included in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a sittings motion that we are debating and we have been doing so for some time. Perhaps the hon. Lady could take up her specific question at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point, Mr. Martin. I was not denying that we are debating the sittings motion, but, in response to a sedentary comment, I was making

the point that I had hoped that the Minister would address himself to that item in his reply. I hope that he takes the opportunity to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But he is not going to do it in his reply because he would be out of order.</span></p>

We have improved the circumstances for rape victims in former legislation, but she is welcome to table an amendment.<br><br>
Those at the sharp end of law and order matters—the police—strongly support the Bill's provisions. Police organisations, which are closest to the problems and to the public experience, supported our proposals in their detailed responses to consultation. It is in response to their concerns and those of the Scottish people that we have made those proposals. As I have said, however, we will discuss the most appropriate timing of sittings.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That, during the proceedings on the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Further consideration adjourned—[Mr. Peter Ainsworth.]</i></p>
<p><i>Adjourned accordingly at eight minutes to One o'clock till Thursday 14 November at half-past Ten o 'clock.</i></p>
