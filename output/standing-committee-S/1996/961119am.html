<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am issuing a consultation paper today and a letter has been sent to each member of the Committee enclosing a copy of the consultation paper on restriction of liberty and electronic monitoring.<br><br>
Also, at our previous sitting the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham) expressed a number of concerns about the list of qualifying offences for automatic life sentences and said that incitement to murder was not a known offence in Scotland. To my surprise, I read in Saturday's press of a case in which someone had been convicted in the High Court in Edinburgh of precisely that offence. The hon. Lady was correct about clandestine injury, but incitement to murder is known in the law of Scotland. The article in <i>The Scotsman</i> on Saturday 16 November was headed:
<br><blockquote><p>"Man guilty of plot to kill his neighbour"</p></blockquote>
It quoted at length from that case.<br><br>
I thought that I should clarify that minor detail because we are anxious to retain the precise terms used in Scottish indictments.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment moved [14 November]:</i> No. 5, in page 2, line 8, leave out 'shall' and insert 'may'.—[<i>Mr. McFall.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 7, page 2, line 12, leave out 'life' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"a period of years not exceeding ten".</p></blockquote>
No. 66, in page 2, line 18, leave out 'require' and insert 'allow'.<br><br>
No. 22, in clause 2, page 4, line 23, leave out 'shall' and insert 'may'.<br><br>
No. 25, in clause 2, page 4, line 34, leave out 'require' and insert 'allow'.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned last Thursday we were discussing amendment No. 5 and I was referring to the comments of Lord Hope, the former Lord Justice-General in Scotland. He said of the position of Scots law:
<br><blockquote><p>"In my opinion … the position in Scotland is entirely different, as anyone with any practical experience of our criminal law will at once appreciate. You only have to look at the list of offences in paragraph 8.5 of the White Paper"</p></blockquote>
on crime and punishment
<br><blockquote><p>"to see the grave risks to which our system of criminal justice would be exposed if this measure were to be enacted in this form. The list is composed almost entirely of common law crimes. It is plainly incomplete, if it is intended to provide a comprehensive list of those violent and sexual offences which cause most concern. For example, the offence of lewd, libidinous and indecent conduct".</p></blockquote>
That subject has been addressed by the Minister, but on the issue of common law and statutory law, the common law is one of the strengths of Scotland. At a conference last Saturday, I was tackled on the subject of stalking by a former Scottish law lord. He wanted it to remain a common law offence with breach of the peace, but I pointed out that imprisonment for breach of the peace is not very long and that that is a deficiency in the law. However, he emphasised the strength of Scots law in terms of its approach to the common law.<br><br>
The reason for the provision to remove judicial discretion is supposed toughness, but the first paragraph on page viii of the Bill states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is anticipated that the proposals in Clause I for automatic life sentences will have very little impact on the prison population in the initial years following implementation, because the number of offenders sentenced will be relatively small and most of them would otherwise be likely to have received long determinate sentences".</p></blockquote>
If that is so, why are automatic life sentences being introduced when the number of prisoners affected will not be great? One reason given by the Secretary of State and the Minister of State on Second Reading was the case of Gavin Maguire. The Opposition have pushed the Government on that case and, hey presto, the Secretary of State says that if automatic life sentences had been available at the time of the Maguire case, he would not have been out to commit that offence. To bring the Minister back to the provisions of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, the Maguire case arose before the implementation of that Act and I contend that Maguire would have been caught by its provisions.<br><br>
Those provisions only came into effect on 1 May this year. They require those given long sentences to come out on mandatory supervision. That means that Maguire would have been supervised. In terms of public safety, therefore, the provisions of the 1993 Act ensure greater safety than those in the Bill which do not provide supervision for those released after having served long sentences. Public safety demands that the protection given by the 1993 Act continues—the Government, however, are jettisoning its provisions.<br><br>
I made a number of inquiries with the social work department about the Maguire case. The social workers told me that they had no hold on him at all. They tried to chase him through three or four changes of address before, eventually, they tracked him down
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
to Ayrshire. they were cyring out to have a hold on him and were delighted that they would have been allowed to under 1993 provisions.<br><br>
The Government, however, want to throw away that power. The Maguire case could easily be replicated by anyone serving more than four years if the Bill is enacted. Part III would allow those serving long sentences to get out without supervised release orders—which will be granted only if the court has the presence of mind to lay down that such an order should be implemented at the time. That is unsatisfactory.<br><br>
The implementation of the Bill's provisions would result in less public safety than was provided by the 1993 Act. That illustrates the haste with which the Government drafted the measure and the populist approach of the Secretary of State. He wants to seem tough but the measures in the Bill suggest that no more people will be caught as a result of those measures.<br><br>
The Opposition have no problem on the issue of mandatory life sentences since the legislation abolishing the death penalty in 1960. That replaced the capital penalty with life sentences for murder and applies in Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales.<br><br>
We have no objection to mandatory life sentences because they are a reflection of how society cannot allow murderers to get away with the idea that their act is insignificant. Such sentences are meant as a deterrent and a punishment and are a civilising influence compared with capital punishment. We have no argument with that aspect. What surprises me, however, is how the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) and the Secretary of State have been talking about honesty in sentencing. I thought that, this morning, lo and behold, we would find an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ayr in favour of capital punishment because he is going about the country saying, "We must have honesty in sentencing: let's ensure that the public get what they want."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have I baited the hon. Gentleman? I did not mean to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to table such an amendment. If the hon. Gentleman will give me his signature to it, we could achieve the level of all-party support that would be required to agree to such a proposal. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that, once such an amendment were on the Table, I should not be prepared to withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman sees his friend the Secretary of State he should say to him, "Let's get everything right in the Bill." The Secretary of State has said that if capital punishment comes up, he will vote for it. We look forward to the hon. Member for Ayr making a trip to Dover House—going in through the back door to avoid being seen by the Minister of State—and seeing the Secretary of State and saying, "Michael, let's get this measure included in the Bill." If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
the hon. Gentleman believes in honesty in sentencing, he should face up to his remarks, otherwise, we should consider his remarks to be nothing more than a sham.<br><br>
I know that the hanging cell in Barlinnie D-hall has been demolished and has been given to the Royal Museum of Scotland with other artefacts of judicial torture such as thumb screws and a primitive guillotine known as a maiden. Will the hon. Gentleman make a trip to Edinburgh to ensure that he gets the hanging cell back to Barlinnie? That is what his supposed honest approach determines.<br><br>
We have no problem with mandatory sentencing. Automatic sentencing will not put any more people in prison, but it will put the law into jeopardy and lead to an increase in disrespect for the law. For example, severe injury is listed among the qualifying offences in part I on page 3 of the Bill—we spoke about it the other day. An automatic sentence would be given if a previous offence had included severe injury. That leads us to the lottery aspect of the phrase "severe injury". It will be down to the local procurator fiscal or the advocate-depute for the Crown counsel to frame the indictment and decide whether an injury is severe. Those people will decide whether the information passed to them by the police can be expressed in such words, which could mean that a procurator fiscal in one area could decide that an assault constituted a severe injury to another person, but that a procurator fiscal in another area could decide that it did not. If the phrase is not in the complaint, the offender cannot be convicted of it and would not, therefore, receive an automatic life sentence. When a procurator fiscal frames an indictment, he must do so with the intention that it will be adjudicated on by the court—an indictment must contain that libel. Given that the decision is down to individual procurators fiscal, there will be inconsistencies, which we consider to be a recipe for disrespect for the rule of law.<br><br>
Again, the problem is indicative of the haste with which the Government are introducing the Bill and is allied to the fact that they refuse to define "exceptional circumstances". We got into that debate last Thursday and do not want to discuss the issue again, but it has ramifications for the clause. When I spoke to the former Lord Justice-General last Saturday, I asked him about exceptional circumstances. He said that any judge worth his or her salt would not define exceptional circumstances so that they could not be commented on by a court of appeal and the judgment would stand. For exceptional circumstances, there will be no additional enhancement of the rule of the law. Judges will simply clam up on the subject. That blows a hole in the Government's case for judicial discretion.<br><br>
We are discussing automatice life sentences because of how the Bill will be implemented and because it will remove judicial discretion. As Lord Hope said, the situation in Scotland is different from that in England and Wales. In England and Wales, the law is not inferior, but it is different. Scots law works on the principle of common law and we want that to be maintained.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0062">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
The Government wants courts to pass automatic life sentences for all serious repeat offenders, whatever the individual circumstances. It would be unjust were individual circumstances not investigated. Judges already have the discretionary power to pass life sentences for serious violent and sexual offences when the gravity of the crime and the dangerousness of the offender justify that. Indeed, in the case of Gavin Maguire, which we mentioned earlier, the noble Lord McCluskey passed the most severe sentence, but it was reduced on appeal. The principles on mandatory and automatic life sentences in the White Paper for this Bill are not much different from those for the English legislation produced by the Home Secretary. The proposals in the White Paper to allow departures from the mandatory sentence in exceptional circumstances will do little to mitigate this injustice. Unlike a mandatory life sentence, fixed sentences reflect an assessment of the particular case and of the offender's just desserts. The circumstances of offences within these categories vary widely, as we have already discussed.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I take exception to the Government's argument about public safety. They argue that the proposals will increase public safety for two reasons. First, the White Paper says that determinate sentences mean that the offender must be released once that sentence has been served, even if there is every reason to believe that he or she will commit further serious offences—why did it take the Government 16 years to wake up to that, given all the criminal law Bills that have been introduced since 1979?—whereas, when life sentences are passed, before dangerous offenders are released an assessment must be made to see whether they still pose a risk. Secondly, in the Government's opinion, an offender released from a life sentence will remain on licence and subject to recall for the rest of his or her life.<br><br>
However, courts can already pass life sentences. On numerous occasions on Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) asked the Secretary of State about the number of appeals by the Lord Advocate. There has been a puny number and yet if the situation was serious, it would be reflected in the number of appeals by the Lord Advocate. If a serious repeat offence is committed, it should be asked why, if reoffending is genuinely predictable, the power of recall to prison was not used before. We have been pushing the Government on that issue.<br><br>
There are some reasonable arguments for making a new, reviewable sentence available to the courts, as the Butler committee proposed in 1975 for England and Wales—not as a mandatory sentence but as an additional option. However, automatic life sentences could actually weaken public protection by increasing the risk of wrongful acquittals. I quote Lord Taylor, the former Lord Chief Justice, on the issue of minimum sentences because the principles apply also to Scotland:
<br><blockquote><p>"Minimum sentences are incompatible with an existing and important strand in our criminal law. The courts have long followed a policy of discounting sentences for timely pleas of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
guilty…Defendants who know that they will receive a mandatory sentence of lengthy imprisonment, and even more so, a mandatory life sentence, are not likely to plead guilty."</p></blockquote>
That is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) and others have reiterated time and again. In rape cases, a defendant will not plead guilty if he faces an automatic life sentence. He will be given professional advice to plead not guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is mumbling from a sedentary position and obviously wants to intervene in my hon. Friend's speech. Perhaps my hon. Friend will give way to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps the Committee will let me worry about the Minister mumbling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to know that you will worry about the Minister, Mr. Martin, so that we do not need to.<br><br>
To return to what I was saying about rape cases, defendants will plead not guilty and will have their day in court, but the victim will have to go through the humiliation of a trial. The Minister cannot recoil from that. The Government are ensuring that the victim will be further humiliated as a result of these provisions. Far from being on the side of the victim, the Government are discriminating against victims in such cases.<br><br>
I want to quote from a letter to <i>The Times</i> on 12 March 1996 from Helena Kennedy QC. It says,
<br><blockquote><p>"A Minister expressing concern for the victims of crime should consider that rapists facing automatic life sentences will have no incentive to plead guilty. They will contest the most clear-cut cases, subjecting their victims to further humiliation and trauma…I hope that when the Home Secretary comes to face the women of his party they will point out the damage this policy will wreak upon victims of sexual crime who are already so disadvantaged."</p></blockquote>
The proposal will not enhance Scots law or the public's respect for it; rather, it will diminish their respect. For those reasons we want the Government to reconsider the matter. Judicial discretion should be permitted in relation to life sentences and an appropriate sentence should be given for the relevant crimes.<br><br>
With regard to the 1993 Act, we have argued for some time that those serving long sentences for sexual offences should be supervised when they are released. There is a deficiency in the Bill in that regard that must be remedied before the Bill returns to the Floor of the House and proceeds to the other place. The Government must meet society's demand that people who are released after serving a long sentence should be supervised; and they must enhance rather than diminish public safety. We have moved the amendment to that end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The amendment and those grouped with it are being considered under clause 1, which is about automatic life sentences for serious sexual and violence offences. However, amendments Nos. 22 and 25 refer to clause 2, which is about minimum sentences for drug
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0063">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
traffickers. Amendments Nos. 23 and 24, which will be considered when we reach clause 2, can be understood only in relation to amendments Nos. 22 and 25.<br><br>
Should we debate amendments Nos. 23 and 24 under clause 1, or should we debate them when we reach clause 2? Should we postpone our discussion of amendments Nos. 22 and 25 until we reach clause 2?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it suits the Committee, I am happy to add amendments Nos. 23 and 24 to amendments Nos. 7, 66, 22 and 25, which are grouped with amendment No. 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That decision is a matter for the Whips and Opposition Front Benchers, not for me. We cannot debate amendments Nos. 23 and 24 unless we also debate amendments Nos. 22 and 25—they should be grouped together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Whips do is not a matter for me or for any other member of the Committee. I am prepared to give the Committee the option of grouping amendments Nos. 23 and 24 with those that are grouped with amendment No. 5 so that we can debate them together. Mr. McFall, as the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman, what is your view?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be sensible because the relevant amendments are about drugs. If the Committee accepts your proposal, Mr. Martin, I should be happy with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me ask the Minister what he thinks about the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to fit in with the Committee's wishes. However, if I may say so, it is for the Committee and not for the Whips to decide on such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and I are at one on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. It might be more convenient for the Committee if amendments Nos. 22 and 25 were considered when we come to clause 2. We should try not to mix up two separate debates—about violent and sexual offences and about drug trafficking—under clause 1. Rather than running together our debates on those two important matters, should not we debate them separately?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall consult on this. I take the hon. Gentleman's point. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Order. I am on my feet. If I hear discussions going on next to me when I am addressing the Committee, I will allow no one other than the Clerk and <i>Hansard</i> staff on the Chairman's Table.<br><br>
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Dundee East (Mr. McAllion) but I must he careful to avoid repetition. The only option is to take the two amendments tabled to clause 2 and include them with this group of amendments. If the Committee agrees to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
that, it will allow a full debate on the clear understanding that we cannot discuss the amendments again. I am meeting the hon. Gentleman half way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Does that mean that when we discuss clause 2 we will have only a clause 2 stand part debate and that there will be no debate on the amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be a clause 2 stand part debate, but the hon. Gentleman should bear in mind that he will be at liberty to discuss the two amendments in full while we address this group of amendments. I hope that the Committee agrees with that because it is my business to allow us to proceed as smoothly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Given that we are not going to deal with the amendments when we debate clause 2 and that the Minister submitted a paper dealing with clause 4 only this morning—which members of the Committee need to have a chance to read—can we have a guarantee that we will not reach clause 4 this morning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has more power than I in that matter. Since the Committee is in agreement, we will consider also amendments No. 23, in clause 2, page 4, line 25, leave out 'seven' and insert 'ten'. No. 24, in clause 2, page 4, line 28, leave out 'seven' and insert 'five'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I speak to amendments Nos. 23 and 24, I want to support what my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) said about the other amendments and concentrate in particular on rape trials. Helena Kennedy speaks from vast experience of rape trials. She has both defended people accused of rape and acted on behalf of its victims. She has, therefore, direct experience of what we are discussing. Quite apart from the unnecessary humiliation suffered by a rape victim when subjected to a trial, it is possible for court proceedings to go on at great length, possibly resulting in days of questioning for the victim. Those days of questioning are not without purpose and are not intended simply to upset the victim. Every question put in court over those days is meant to put doubt in the jury's mind by creating a niggle of possible dissatisfaction with every tiny item of evidence. One reason why there is such a huge number of acquittals in Scottish courts and why so many not guilty and not proven verdicts are given is that enormous energy, effort and time is put into inserting doubt in people's minds. If we are serious about obtaining guilty verdicts when a person should be found guilty, the Minister should think again about the processes that we are discussing this morning.<br><br>
On the issue of life sentences and capital punishment, although I do not want to wind up the hon. Member for Ayr too much—especially as I will be looking for his support on some matters relating to children—if hon. Members say that they believe in capital punishment, they have ample opportunity while we are in the throes of discussing this Bill to table suitable amendments. They will never get any support

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
from me because I utterly oppose capital punishment, but there is nothing to stop an hon. Member from tabling an amendment, seeking support from his party—which the hon. Member for Ayr is more likely to get from his colleagues—and seeing what happens. I do not believe that the House is minded to support capital punishment, but if hon. Members are serious about that, they have a chance to act. If they do not take that chance now, they must for ever hold their peace, because we cannot believe that they are serious.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the hon. Lady makes a valid point. Perhaps, however, I am mistaken in accepting that on the issue of capital punishment, there are regular free votes in the House. I know that the hon. Lady is a supporter of the free vote. Is she therefore suggesting that I should abandon the argument for a free vote, which she advanced, and follow my own line on the matter? I suspect that I would not succeed on this occasion.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is for the hon. Gentleman to decide whether he wants to urge his party to support a free vote. I certainly support a free vote on an issue such as capital punishment, but it is up to the hon. Gentleman to work out with his party when there should be free votes and when there should not. Lately, Conservative Members got themselves into a muddle by holding a Whipped vote last night but wanting a free vote on the issue of taking the belt to Wales. Of course I support a free vote on capital punishment, but that is not germane to what I am saying.<br><br>
There is nothing to stop the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) or any other hon. Member tabling an amendment to restore capital punishment, but if they do not mean it, I wish hon. Members would stop talking about it and let us get on with reality.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 tie in with amendment No. 22, which would alter clause 2(2) to read "the court may" instead of
<br><blockquote><p>"the court shall sentence the person"</p></blockquote>
to these lengthy terms of imprisonment. Amendment No. 23 would increase the term of imprisonment for a person over the age of 21 to 10 years, while amendment No. 24 would change the prescribed term to five years. Both amendments, however, depend on members of the Committee approving the substitution of the world "shall" by "may". We do not want to be so rigid on the issue. I imagine that my hon. Friends would not press amendments Nos. 23 and 24 if we did not succeed in changing "shall" to "may" in line 23 of clause 2.<br><br>
We take offences such as class A drug trafficking extremely seriously. Clause 2 refers to a third offence, so we are talking about a long-term commitment to a life of serious crime. I want society to deal severely with that, but I also want the court to be able to exercise its judgment more fully than the wording of clause 2 would allow. Although subsection (3) states that
<br><blockquote><p>"if the court is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances",</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
I would still prefer subsection (2) to say "may" rather than "shall", to show that the Committee, and eventually Parliament, intend to provide an extra degree of leeway for the court.<br><br>
Although the judge will be able to say that there are exceptional circumstances in a certain case and therefore impose a much lighter sentence, I understand that if there were an appeal, the judge would have to set out the specific grounds for his decision. However, that would arise only if there were an appeal, and there might not be. The amendments will open the matter up to debate and allow us to hear what the Minister has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill explained, we want to substitute the word "may" for the word "shall" in subsection (2), which would reinforce the judicial discretion of sheriffs and judges to determine on the merits of an individual case what sentence should be imposed. That is important. As you have explained to members of the Committee, Mr. Martin, we are debating clauses 1 and 2. The former deals with automatic life sentences for serious sexual or violent offences, while the latter concerns minimum sentences for drug traffickers.<br><br>
The Government must make a case for setting aside judicial discretion. They should argue that judges and sheriffs should have no discretion other than to impose the sentences which are determined in the Bill, but I have yet to hear from the Minister or, indeed, from any Conservative Member any justification for either of the clauses being put on to the statute book. At page viii of the Bill in the explanatory memorandum, the Government discuss the likely effect of the clauses, stating:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is anticipated that the proposals in Clause I for automatic life sentences will have very little impact on the prison population in the initial years following implementation, because the number of offenders sentenced will be relatively small and most of them would otherwise be likely to have received long determinate sentences, if not a life sentence. The proposals in Clause 2 for mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking will likewise have a minimal effect on the prison population, for similar reasons."</p></blockquote>
If those clauses will have a minimal effect on the number of people sent to prison why on earth are the Government bringing them forward? If there are existing powers for the courts which allow them to pass the sentences that people deserve for the crimes that they have committed, why is it necessary to bring forward clauses which the Government argue will have no effect—the prison population will stay much the same?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that related to the fact that in the financial memorandum the Government state that the measure will be cost free?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nothing with this Government is ever cost free, but they always claim that things will be. I remember, as will my hon. Friend, that we were told when the poll tax came in that it would be cost free: it cost the taxpayer £14,000 million to implement and to abolish. The Government cannot be trusted when they suggest that something will be cost free.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0065">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
The Minister must convince the Committee. If the clauses will have a minimal effect on who is sent to prison, why are we wasting our time debating them? What are the Government up to? Page 33 of the White Paper, "Crime and Punishment", which has been sent to members of the Committee by the Scottish Office, deals with the existing discretionary powers of judges to give a life or a long determinate sentence. The Government complain that although the powers exist, the courts are not bringing in enough life sentences. They want to interfere with judicial discretion.<br><br>
The point is made I referred to it in a previous sitting—by examining convictions between 1990 and 1994 for violent offences such as attempted murder: of 252 people convicted, only five were given life; of five people convicted for incitement or conspiracy to murder, none was given life; of 213 people convicted for culpable homicide, three were given life; of 387 people convicted of assault to danger of life, one was given life. The Government do not think that the courts are using their powers, so they have brought in the clauses to interfere with judicial discretion, to force judges to give automatic life sentences or seven-year sentences for drug traffickers.<br><br>
The Government do not think that the judges are doing enough, yet Minister has the effrontery to tell the Committee that he does not want to interfere with judicial discretion. He has brought forward clauses which interfere with judicial discretion. Why? Because they are a unionist Government who are more thrilled to the Home Office in England and Wales than to the Scottish Office in Edinburgh, and, because there is a problem in England and Wales, we must have the same solution—which does not even relate to Scotland.<br><br>
The number of serious—violent and sexual—offences committed in England and Wales is much greater than in Scotland: the rate of increase in England and Wales is about six times that in Scotland. We are dealing with an English Bill which addresses an English situation and is being imposed on Scotland for no reason other than that these people have been told by the Home Secretary to get on with things in Scotland. They think that it might be a good election gimmick, but the problem is that it will not make any difference.<br><br>
There is a real problem when it comes to drug trafficking offences, which I referred to in my earlier point of order. The amendments would increase the sentence from seven to 10 years for those over 21, and reduce the sentence from seven to five years for those between 18 and 21 years. This is partly to reflect the fact that we think that people in the 18 to 21 age group should be dealt with differently from those who are 21 and over. However, we are also concerned that in changing the sentences in this way, it should be left to the judges to decide which kind of sentence should be imposed in these circumstances.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
As I mentioned earlier, the hon. Member for Ayr was very much involved in the deaths that took place in Hangar 13 of people who had been taking the class-A drug ecstasy. I remember reading a report of the subsequent hearings—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should clarify what he means when he says that I was very much involved in the deaths of those young people. I would hate it to look in <i>Hansard</i> as if I were in any way responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to make it clear that the hon. Gentleman was not in any way responsible. He sometimes gives the impression that he is on E, but apart from that he is not responsible for any of the deaths that occurred in Hangar 13.<br><br>
The report of the inquiry into those deaths made the point that on one Saturday night in that particular club venue, there were more than 1,200 young people. The police estimated that half of them had been taking the drug E—either one, two or three tablets. They also estimated that there were 25 pushers in there. Those are the kind of people who will fall within the scope of clause 2 and receive minimum sentences of seven or 10 years. But my point is that the 25 people who were there pushing E are not the kind of drug traffickers at whom the Bill is aimed. They are probably drug addicts themselves, who get the drugs from someone else and sell them on to feed their own habit. These people need help; they do not need to be banged up in prison for seven or 10 years. The real drug traffickers do not take drugs—those who make money out of selling drugs usually are not addicts. They stay well away from drugs, because there are big bucks to be made out of trafficking. They are the people who should receive increased prison sentences—not the addicts, who get perhaps 200 or 300 tablets and then sell them on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that there are big bucks to be made. An article I read the other week indicated that the former United States Assistant Attorney-General, Michael Zeldon, spoke to the International Bar Association in Berlin on 23 October and said that the American Government estimated that $300 billion of dirty money had been laundered in drugs. The amendment would show drug pushers that that is not acceptable, and that we are tougher than the Government on the drugs issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. We are tougher on the real villains of the piece—the people who make money out of the drugs industry.<br><br>
In the early 1980s, President Reagan and his wife Nancy launched a war against drugs in America, which had virtually no effect because they were aiming at the wrong people. The people who make the big bucks are not drug addicts, but are respectable business people. Those are the kind of people that we should ensure are locked up—the people who feed the habit of others. I understand that the CIA has been pushing drugs in certain cities in America. The Government of America were part of the drugs

trade—they were making money out of the drugs trade to support the Contra war in Nicaragua, which Conservative Members also supported.<br><br>
If discretion is removed from judges and they are told that they must impose a certain sentence on the third conviction, people who are really in need of help might be locked up in prision. The wrong people will be targeted, arrested and imprisoned. That will just add to the problems in prisons.<br><br>
It is a crazy situation: Scotland has one of the lowest rates of increase in serious offences anywhere in western Europe—apart from Northern ireland, which has its own specific problems. England and Wales have a bigger problem than Scotland. However, Scotland has a higher percentage of its population in prision than anywhere in western Europe, again apart from Northern Ireland. Conservative Member's proposals would worsen Scotland's reputation for putting its people in prison for longer periods. That is a daft way to address the problem.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The Minister and the Government have their arguments wrong; they are targeting the wrong people. Clause 2 in particular affects drug addicts who need proper treatment, but who are more likely to be left in prison without receiving it. In fact, drugs get into prisons in any case and some people leave prison worse drug addicts than they were when they first entered it. It is a very serious problem and the Minister should deal with it in his reply.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr made some pathetic arguments about why he has not tabled amendments on hanging. If he genuinely believes that hanging should be used as a means of punishing offenders in Scotland, he should table an amendment and test the Committee's views. I would vote against it. I have always voted against the introduction of capital punishment. The hon. Gentleman is frightened because he knows that many Conservative Members would vote against capital punishment too.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ayr claims that he would not table an amendment because he knows that it would be unsuccessful. If I had that attitude I would never open my mouth—nobody accepts some of my beliefs, even on my side of the Committee. We need to test opinion and put our ideas forward. If the hon. Gentleman is principled in his belief in capital punishment, he should table an amendment for us to debate in Committee. If he did so, he would find that Front-Bench Conservative Members would vote against him. That would not suit the hon. Gentleman who wants to go back to Ayr at the next general election and tell his constituents that the Tories are in favour of capital punishment, which the Labour party is not. The truth is that Tories are not in favour of capital punishment. The Secretary of State is not here but other Front-Bench Conservatives would vote against it because they are decent civilised people, unlike the hon. Member for Ayr.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is good to follow the hon. Member for Dundee, East. I recall him making an impassioned speech in which he pleaded with the Committee to allow him to attend the Rangers-Celtic game. Perhaps he regrets that speech now, but that is another matter.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman some good points—for example, that Scotland had a lower rise in serious crime than elsewhere in the United Kingdom and indeed than in the rest of the developed world. That is an important fact which suggests that the Government are getting it right. He also pointed out that there are more people in Scottish prisons than elsewhere in the United Kingdom and the rest of the developed world. It is important that many hardened criminals are locked up in Scotland. That connects with the hon. Gentleman's comments about the lower incidence of serious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do have more people locked up than other countries of western Europe. However, they are locked up for shorter periods. We use prison as a means of dealing with people, such as drug addicts, who should not be in prison. The average prison sentence is for 5.4 months. We are using prison wrongly. Prison should be used for serious offenders who are a threat to the public, yet we are locking up people who are not a threat to the public. The Bill will continue that trend. As they say in Dundee. it is up the wrang dreel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends on how the hon. Gentleman views serious crime. I consider burglary, for example, as a serious crime which affects many old people. It can be devastating for such people yet it frequently attracts very short sentences. We should consider that seriously.<br><br>
From the comments of the hon. Member for Dundee, East one would imagine that he would support the Bill because it attempts to address the issue of unwise short sentences that are frequently passed in Scottish courts. On that basis, I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments.<br><br>
I should like to ask my right hon. Friend the Minister how much consideration is given, in discussions of the cash implications of the Bill, to the other side of the argument? How must will society save if recognised hardened criminals are locked up for longer in a controlled manner, as is the case with life sentences? Society will save money—by reducing legal aid costs and unnecessary court cases—and will have peace of mind. Perhaps the cost of the Bill will balance out, as my right hon. Friend suggested, because people will stay in prison longer and the cost of crime will be reduced. My right hon. Friend has perhaps taken account of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Go on, everyone gives way in Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I knew that it was silly of me to let the hon. Gentleman intervene—his comment was silly. Offenders may receive short sentences, leave prison and be locked up on remand a few days later because they have committed another crime. The Bill calls for the means to control such individuals and gives society the power to control their activities by retaining them in prison until they—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham (Perth and Kinross)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Lady can speak in a minute.<br><br>
I want to return to the point about drugs. I have some sympathy with amendment No. 23, which the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) tabled and which proposes a 10-year sentence for people over 21. I do not, however, understand why he has gone the other way in amendment No. 24 and sought to reduce sentences for those under 21 from seven to five years. We are talking about drug dealers who have made the same mistake—if we can call it that—three times. How many deaths might they have caused in that time? I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman goes one way for 21-year-olds and the other way for people under 21. Perhaps he can explain that.<br><br>
Will my right hon. Friend the Minister comment on the seven-year sentence, which seems rather light? I recognise that it is only a minimum sentence and that the courts will have jurisdiction thereafter and will be able to take account of the circumstances mentioned by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. He spoke about traffickers who have a drugs habit, but when such people are caught selling for the third time, my sympathy for many of them goes out of the window.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No I shall not give way again. I understand the hon. Gentleman's comments about the attention that we should pay to so-called business men who have managed to keep their hands clean. The law enforcement services are intent on bringing such people to justice, although that is often difficult. If, however, we take out of society those at the forefront of the drugs trade, life will become harder for the big business men. They will be forced to become more involved and might be caught red handed as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr is absolutely wrong. Minor drug dealers are likely buses—another one will come along in a minute. Many kids are caught up in these horrific happenings. I am most worried that we shall bang up those young lads who sell 20 or 30 capsules to feed their own habit. Banging them up for a third time will not help. That would show only that we are failing somewhere along the line. If banging them up does not work the first time, it certainly will not work the second or third time.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
I am worried about how trafficking and dealing are defined. Traffickers are very serious people who make a lot of money. Some people in my constituency have made absolute fortunes. Temazepam was a legal class 4 drug prescribed on the NHS, but I discovered that to become a wholesaler of the capsules one had only to register with Companies house as a pharmaceutical wholesaler. It was that easy: no expertise was necessary. Getting a Department of Trade and Industry licence to export 5 million temazepam capsules was equally straightforward. The capsules could then be bought from a manufacturer for 3p each.<br><br>
No proof was needed to show that the capsules had been exported. There was no policing. On paper, this country exported more temazepam than it manufactured. What was happening was that the capsules were being sold for export, and then not exported, but sold off on the back streets.<br><br>
The people who made the real money out of that were not the guys who sold 30 capsules at a disco, but the wholesalers. They bought the capsules for 3p each in the first place, and then saw them sold on the street for between £1 and £3. That was big money, but we were never able to get those people behind bars. They seemed always to be able to walk away. The drugs problem will not be solved if we take the people who sell small amounts on the streets. Other ways must be found.<br><br>
I support the amendment. It is important that the Bill leaves room for some discretion. I am all for giving sentences of 10 years or even 20 years to people who are caught selling vast quantities of drugs. My worry is for the kids caught up in that horrific trade who have become addicts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the amendment refers only to increasing the minimum sentence from seven to 10 years. It offers no qualifications along the lines suggested by the hon. Lady. Does she support the amendment, or not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Adams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 deal with that.<br><br>
It is very important that the courts have the discretion proposed by amendment No. 5. The people who make many millions of pounds out of the drugs trade would never be seen at a disco, or at a rave in Ayr. They are very far removed: they exist behind closed gates, with a Rolls Royce in the drive.<br><br>
We need greater detection rates to catch those people. They are not the ones who sell a few capsules to feed their own habit. The problem cannot be resolved by sending those minor dealers to prison for seven or 10 years. All hon. Members know that there is a huge drug problem in the prisons, which will not be dealt with by calling minor dealers "traffickers". The Minister must look at how traffickers are defined, and decide which offenders fall into that category.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up a couple of points made by the hon. Member for Ayr when he spoke about the size of Scotland's prison population. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows as well as everyone else that the prison population is so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0068">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
high in Scotland not because the prisons are full of the most violent and serious offenders, but because many people are there for fine defaulting and other minor crimes for which they are put away in far greater numbers than anywhere else in Europe. Nothing in the Bill will change that, so it is wrong for him to suggest that the Bill is a panacea. Imprisonments will continue and we should examine that matter seriously. It is also wrong for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that, somehow, imprisonments have a bearing on violent crime and the lower rate of increase in Scotland, because the two matters are separate.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I support amendment No. 5 and shall speak to amendment No. 7, which is in my name.<br><br>
We are introducing inflexibility into the law, and inflexible law is invariably bad law. If flexibility is taken away, so is the ability to deal with individual circumstances. I do not want to rehearse all the arguments about exceptional circumstances; clearly it is envisaged that they will be invoked only rarely, if at all. The reality is that we are introducing an inflexibility where none existed before. That will be unhelpful and there will be resulting injustices.<br><br>
The business of automatic sentences has been described, rather memorably, by a constituent of mine as the "two toots and yer oot" approach to law. He is the landlord of my constituency office and a lawyer but, I suspect, by no means radical. He regarded that approach as akin to straightjacket diplomacy and utterly unhelpful.<br><br>
On Thursday, I commented on the business of trying to import into Scots law something that is designed to deal with circumstances in a different legal system. I shall not go over that in such detail but want at least to mention the matter again because it is germane. Minimum sentencing is being introduced to a system of common law from a system in which, for whatever reason, minimum sentencing appears to be much more acceptable when the offences are, in the main, defined by statute.<br><br>
As I said previously, practice and procedure in Scotland's criminal courts is very different from the practice in England and Wales. The list of offences is almost entirely common law crime. In connection with a couple of them, the Minister was kind enough last week to say that he would accept in principle the issue of clandestine injury being included, for which I am grateful because it clears up a discrepancy. But that is in itself an example of what will happen if the Bill becomes law.<br><br>
I listened with interest to the Minister's comments about incitement to murder. I, too, saw the reports of the case to which he referred and based my original comments on Sheriff Gordon's criminal law, which, as the Minister will know, is the standard text for criminal law in Scotland. It describes incitement to murder as having only the most tenuous place in Scots law. The Minister will forgive me for taking an acknowledged expert in Scots criminal law at face value, but the appearance of incitement to murder in that recent case—it is not standard in Scots law and appears only rarely—is an example of how
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
procurators fiscal are able to frame cases widely in common law. It is extremely rare but can be done, which shows the enormous flexibility of Scottish law and the difficulty of making a straightforward importation from England.<br><br>
Finally, in Scotland most serious cases of child abuse are prosecuted under libidinous and indecent conduct. However, such conduct is not included in the list, which therefore excludes the very crime that most serious cases of child abuse are prosecuted under. If there is any doubt about my remarks, I should point out that Lord Hope concurs with my opinion.<br><br>
The Chairman: Order. I recall that last week the hon. Lady made an excellent case about that matter. The amendment proposes leaving out "shall" and inserting "may", and the debate should be about reducing or increasing the relevant sentences. I hope that she will restrict her remarks to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you will appreciate, Mr. Martin, that it is difficult to restrict my remarks that narrowly—the whole principle is affected by an individual's circumstance. The principle is—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to the hon. Lady's remarks and her comments on principles, and I respect the fact that she is a practising lawyer, which is important. However, does she accept that the Lord Chancellor is probably one of the greatest living authorities on Scots law and that he is a member of the Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I must point out that I have not been a practising lawyer since I was elected to the House. The hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is he a Tory?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that he might be—but that is not relevant to the amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 7 would remove the life sentence for offenders aged between 18 and 21 and replace it with a shorter sentence. Without the amendment, the Bill will have no proportionality. If every offender is given an automatic life sentence the sanction will be devalued, especially among young people, and whatever deterrent effect may be involved will be weakened. The amendment would enable young people aged between 18 and 21 to spend some of their adulthood reflecting on what they have done, but they will be released early enough still to have a life, which is important.<br><br>
Conservative Members discussed the impact of reducing the provisions of clause 1. Scant reference has been made to the one big example from across the Atlantic ocean, where similar provisions have already been enacted. The experience from the United States does not bear out the Government's professed expectation about the imposition of automatic sentences. I am indebted to the Prison Reform Trust for the information that I am going to relate. I hope that the Minister will comment on some of its

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
findings—they are relevant to the whole purpose of the Bill and the question whether it can achieve what the Government want it to achieve.<br><br>
In California a policy of "three strikes and you're out"—as opposed to our proposed "two strikes and you're out"—was introduced in 1994. Although there has been a 13 per cent. decline in the murder rate in California since the introduction of that policy, murder rates in other parts of America have declined by a greater percentage—16 per cent. That includes many states such as New York where the "three strikes and you're out" policy does not apply. On the basis of the American evidence, it would appear that the introduction of such a policy would not make a huge difference to the rate of crime. Indeed, in some states such as Tennessee where there is a "three strikes and you're out" policy, the murder rate has risen by 42 per cent. Will the Minister comment on those examples, which do not display the uniform effect that is expected of the policy?<br><br>
Many factors contribute to a reduction in crime, including simple changes in population structure such as a decline in the number of young males. It is interesting that the United States has experienced a rise in the number of people in employment—I wonder whether that has a greater ultimate effect on crime levels than certain punitive measures being introduced in Scotland. The American experience has been quite salutary and should not be ignored.<br><br>
Lord Hope expressed anxiety about the practice of negotiating pleas and the amount of time that will be taken up in trials, even on first offences, because of the worry that they could be counted as a first "strike". That would have an enormous impact on the working of our criminal law, as has been the case in the United States. I hope that the Minister will comment because the American experience has not been an especially happy one. It has led to the apparent manipulation and distortion of the criminal justice process because it is working precisely as Lord Hope worries that it will work in Scotland: the accused in America are far less likely to plead guilty either because an offence will register or because, if convicted, they will spend far longer in prison. As an interesting comparison, since the introduction of "three strikes and you're out" in California, some county courts have been unable to try civil cases because of the increasing number of criminal trials. Indeed, they are experiencing a vast extra cost because of the introduction of the "three strikes and you're out" policy. We should be worried about that. Have the Governement carefully examined the American example to find out whether the policy makes any difference or, indeed, works?<br><br>
There is growing concern in California that the increased number of remand prisoners who plead not guilty to avoid a "strike" has resulted in some goals releasing non-violent prisoners early. I remind Committee members that such effects will come into play not just when someone is in court charged with a second major offence; they will apply to those who are charged the first time for one of those qualifying
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
offences. There counsel will be bound to tell them right from the start that, because they are now being charged with one of the ultimately qualifying offences, even if it is the first time that they have been charged, all those mechanisms—such as slowing down and being less likely to plead—will come into play. The knock-on effects will be much greater than the Government appear to accept or appreciate. The American example would bear that out. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to comment on some of the earlier debate about the meaning of trafficking offences in clause 2. As my hon. Friend the Member of Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) said, there is a difference between a person who sells a small quantity of drugs and someone who makes drug trafficking a hugely profitable business. Although the first case is a serious one—I should not want to suggest otherwise—the Committee is surely minded to do something about the kind of person who is running a trafficking business with a turnover of millions of pounds. In reality, drug trafficking is big business on an international scale, so there is a large difference in the criminality of someone who is making a huge profit out of multi-million pound sales and who is totally careless of the human lives that are wrecked as a consequence, and a young person—who is impoverished, ill educated and ignorant—selling a small handful of drugs. Nothing in the clause suggests that wide difference along the spectrum. Does the Minister have any thoughts on how we could take more seriously the question of the multi-million pound drug trafficking offence?<br><br>
Some members of the Committee have also asked what we can do about the drug problem. The Government's decision to cut back Customs officers—the very people who could stop drugs from entering the country in the first place—was hardly a wise move. Could you, Mr. Martin, guide us on whether it would be appropriate to table an amendment that would suggest improving customs services? You are shaking your head, Mr. Martin. That is clear guidance. That matter, however, should be raised elsewhere because it is utterly stupid on the one hand to say that we will stop drug trafficking by severe sentences and on the other to allow drugs to come into the country through our ports of entry.<br><br>
Some comparisons have been made with the United States, which is in a worse state than us. It is sad but true that many white people in American society do not care about the future of young black men. They do not care that young black men are brought up in poverty in the ghettos, that they are poorly educated and that they have little to look forward to in life. Many of those young men in areas such as Watts in Los Angeles know nothing else—they have been brought up in a drug-polluted culture and have no opportunity to break out of it and lead a law-abiding and useful life. That is why I would not want to stretch what is happening in this country to fit the state of affairs in the United States.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0070">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
We must think not only about punitive measures but about what else can be done to try to discourage people from getting involved in the drug culture in the first place and in drug trafficking.<br><br>
Prison alone is not enough. As my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North said, if someone who has served a first sentence, leaves prison and starts drug trafficking straight away, his ways have not been mended by his sentence. He may even have learnt in prison how to commit crimes more effectively because prison is a university of crime. Only recently, we learnt how inadequate the education and training in prison can be in preparing offenders for life after prison. If offenders are ever to change their mentality, they need to have some hope for the future and some expectation that they can earn a living and lead a useful life because prison has given them an opportunity to catch up on the education that they missed when they were younger. Many people stop attending school in their mid-teen years and get away with it. If they missed out then and do end up in prison, it should be possible to offer them a second bite at acquiring some sort of education and training. But, so far, such opportunities are not as extensive as they should be. That applies to Cornton Vale: years ago, in a Scottish Grand Committee, I drew attention to the fact that training and education for young women prisoners in Cornton Vale amounted to sewing shrouds and learning how to do hairdressing. Hairdressing may be a useful skill, but we cannot all earn a living that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is pushing her luck in talking about the training that is available during sentences. We are talking about sentences, not the facilities available in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your guidance, Mr. Martin, but it is a subject that the Committee cannot ignore. We cannot simply talk about punitive measures without discussing what society can do to try to eliminate the problem of crime in the first place. Even if it will require further amendments, it is important to distinguish between a young person who has sold a small amount of drugs and a person who is engaged in a major business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak about the automatic sentence of seven years for those convicted of a third offence of drug dealing. Is that sentence being introduced as a deterrent? If so, does he not think that the certainty of being caught and punished expeditiously is likely to be more of a deterrent than a longer sentence some time in the indeterminate future? Like my colleagues, I am also uncertain about the extent to which the term "trafficking" is used in relation to relatively small amounts of drugs—perhaps for personal use or in circumstances in which a group of friends, who would not regard themselves as addicts, supply each other, depending on when they are able to locate supply and when they have cash available. It seems that such a mutual exchange between a small group of young people might lead to some of them being deemed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
traffickers if they were caught. It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify whether the term "traffickers" is bound by any parameters.<br><br>
I am also not clear about how those who sell in order to feed their own habit—pretty desperate individuals, who are unlikely to be rational in their approach—are likely to be deterred by the threat of a severe sentence some time in the future. It seems to me that such people will not be put off by the prospect of a seven-year sentence, and that some other way must be found to deal with their difficulties. Like some of my colleagues who have spoken, I am concerned that the Minister is not introducing proposals to hit those whom I regard as the real traffickers—the wholesalers and the money men behind them—who make enormous sums of money out of an evil trade because they are not involved in the drug trade for personal satisfaction, but simply for commercial gain. I am not convinced that the Government are adequately pursuing the money trail or taking appropriate steps to deal with money laundering and offshore tax havens. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify what steps he and the Government are taking to deal with those elements of the drug trade.<br><br>
I also want the Minister to address the problem of the time that it takes for cases to come to court. I am convinced that when people who are caught dealing drugs realise that their cases might take up to two years to get to court, that acts as a counter-deterrent. The message it sends to people in the community is that there is no effective sanction for drug dealing. I believe that because there is no effective punishment, there is a growth in drug dealing.<br><br>
What monitoring takes place during the period between the police charging someone with a drug offence and the case appearing in court? I understand that the Government may not keep that information, but if they do, will the Minister respond? If the Government do not collect the information, it is important that they should start to do so. A performance target should be set for the legal system to ensure that people are not allowed to wait 18 months to two years before appearing in court.<br><br>
Is the Minister aware of the difficulties that hon. Members have experienced in clarifying details of individual cases and the causes of their delay in coming to court? When people whose names have been given to me by members of my community are charged by the police, I seek clarification on when or whether they are likely to appear in court. The police have told me that because the information is held electronically, the Data Protection Act 1984 prohibits them from giving me those details without fear of breaking the law. I am sure that that was not the objective of the legislation. Will the Minister clarify the circumstances under which hon. Members can obtain such details? It is important for us to know whether there are substantial delays. It is clearly the common view in my area that the legal system takes so long to work that it is not an effective deterrent. In such circumstances, increasing sentences will not have a deterrent effect.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0071">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
The Government are simply sloganising their policy on drugs. They want to appear hard by increasing sentences, but they are not adopting the vigorous approach that would cripple the trade and deal with the money men, the flow of money and wholesale drugs. That is essential if we are to curb the use of drugs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson), for Paisley, North and for Maryhill raised a fair and relevant point. Clause 2 is not aimed at minor drug addicts. It applies only to those convicted in the High Court of a class A drug trafficking offence. The Lord Advocate has the discretion to prosecute drug dealers on indictment in the High Court or the sheriff court. Small-time dealers may be prosecuted in the sheriff court, especially if the solemn sentencing powers of the sheriff are increased to five years as outlined in clause 11. Prosecution policy is very much a matter for the Lord Advocate, not for the Government, but the fact that he has discretion as to the forum, taken with the court's power not to impose a minimum sentence of seven years, should persuade hon. Members that the provision does not introduce unacceptable inflexibility.<br><br>
I shall return to the drugs issue, but first I want to deal with the heart of clause 1. The hon. Member for Dumbarton raised the Maguire case and I shall run through the details. In February 1977 Maguire was sentenced to 10 years on two charges of rape, assault to ravish and other offences. In October 1983 he was released after serving two thirds of his sentence. In November 1986 he was sentenced to 10 years for attempted rape and serious assault. In July 1993 he was released after serving two thirds of his sentence. In August 1995 he was charged with a further sexual assault. The Crown decided not to proceed with the charge at that time because of limited evidence. On 28 November 1995, Maguire was released from custody. Eighteen days later he murdered a 15-year-old girl.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was correct to say that under the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 Maguire would have been under supervision after he had reoffended. The point is that when he was sentenced in November 1986 for the second offence for attempted rape, under the Bill he would have received an automatic life sentence and not been released until he had served the relevant part or minimum period in custody. He would then have been released only when the parole board felt that he presented no risk. Thereafter, under the Bill, he would have been subject to life licence and supervision for the remainder of his days. But he was released in July 1993 and committed murder in November 1995.<br><br>
The Bill would have made absolutely certain that Maguire received a life sentence for the second offence, but he was given a fixed 10-year sentence and released automatically after serving two thirds of the sentence.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
Under the Bill, he would have received a life sentence and would have been released only if the parole board had considered him not to be a risk to public safety.<br><br>
A relevant matter is the STOP programme at Peterhead, which educates sex offenders and confronts them with their practices. Sex offenders' programmes also take place in Barlinnie and elsewhere. If a prisoner refuses to go on one of those programmes, that is a relevant factor which the parole board may take into account in refusing to release him. It will recommend release only when the offender is no longer considered to be a danger to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The notion that has come across in discussing automatic life sentences is that life will mean life, but at our previous sitting the Minister confirmed that early release provisions will apply. However, because the court will have no choice in sentencing, the whole range of disposals will not be available. The Minister confirmed—I would like him to do so again—that under the 1993 Act, Maguire would have been supervised. Section 13 of that Act states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may make rules for regulating the supervision of any description of person released, under this Part of this Act, on licence."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State had that power.<br><br>
I want to ask the Minister—perhaps his civil servants will give him the answer—whether the rules for regulating supervision have been made? If not, why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under the Bill anyone who is released will be on life licence and subject to supervision. We shall discuss supervision release orders later. Maguire would have been in prison until the parole board could recommend that he was no longer a danger to the community. It is obvious that if a man refuses to go on necessary sex education programmes, he will in all probability remain a substantial danger and I believe that the parole board would not recommend release.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister says is hypothetical because Maguire was allowed out and committed the offence after 16 years of the Government's policy. The 1993 Act would have given powers to social workers. My hon. Friends and I were listening to social workers the other day when they said that they chased Maguire up and down avenues for years before being able to locate him. The 1993 Act would have allowed that to happen. The Minister is locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. Therefore, the provisions of the 1993 Act have been thrown overboard with no due regard for the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinction between the supervision of somebody out in the community and the protection of the public when that person is kept in prison until he is no longer a danger to the community. The provisions will put into effect additional protection for the public against the kind of murderous activities in which Maguire was engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0072">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I should like to develop some of the other points.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked how many people would be affected. Happily, the number of people who repeat the serious and violent crimes that would lead to an automatic life sentence is not large. In any year, we are talking about 20 to 30 offenders. While the provisions may not have a significant impact on the prison population, clearly there will be an important effect on victims, potential victims and their families if those crimes can be avoided or reduced in number. They are serious crimes that inflict severe harm on the victims and communities involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has referred to the number of people who are likely to be caught by clause 1. Can he give us the statistics for reoffending for all the qualifying offences included in clause 1? If not, why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had given me notice, I would have endeavoured to obtain the necessary statistics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just given the Minister notice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot expect me to be a walking encyclopedia of statistics. I am happy to obtain for him the necessary information and will seek to do so.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross raised the American example of, as she put it, "three strikes and you're out". There are, of course, extensive differences between the United States and this country; she seeks to draw conclusions from comparing jurisdictions that use the death sentence with our own, under which it was abolished some time ago. America has different gun laws. I have visited America and seen guns being sold, with ammunition, across the counter, with no question of licences. The incidence of homicide is much higher there than it is here and the court cases take infinitely longer—the O. J. Simpson case is a case in point.<br><br>
The proposals seek to deal with repeat serious offenders who are not numerous, but who commit damaging and dangerous crimes. I say to the hon. Member for Dundee, East that we believe that second attempted murders, rapes, robberies with firearms and assaults with danger to life are extremely serious and their inclusion in the Bill is justified.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dumbarton asked about supervision. Clause 3 requires the court to impose a supervised release order on anyone convicted of an offence qualifying for automatic life. In the case of a serious sexual offence, the period of supervision following release may be up to 10 years. The limitation in the 1993 Act involves the lack of targeting and supervision of all offenders sentenced to more than four years, whether or not they are a risk to the public. The Bill targets those who are a recognised, definite danger to the community. All offenders, long-term or short-term, who pose such a risk of harm, should receive a supervised release order. If the court does not impose one, there is the Crown right of appeal.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
The hon. Member for Dumbarton also raised the issue of individual procurators fiscal deciding what is a severe injury. That is not decided by the procurator fiscal. Decisions of that nature go to Crown counsel, who operate as a collegiate body and can therefore be sure that consistency is achieved in respect of serious assaults or assaults to severe injury.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross raised the issue of imprisonment for fine default not being included in the Bill. There is no need to include it in the Bill because there have been supervised attendance orders in Scotland since 1991. Those will be extended throughout Scotland by spring 1998. Imprisonment for fine default should then be minimal.<br><br>
I referred briefly to amendment No. 5. The High Court has a discretion to sentence to a life sentence anyone convicted before it of any common law offence and those offences for which life is the maximum penalty. The purpose of the clause is to establish that life should be an automatic sentence in clearly defined circumstances—for repeat offending involving serious assault or serious sexual offences.<br><br>
The amendment would remove any obligation on the High Court to impose a life sentence on repeat offenders. That would mean that they could well receive a determinate sentence, at the end of which they would be released, regardless of whether they still posed a substantial threat to public safety in the community. We are proposing changes for post-release supervision of certain offenders, including those who commit qualifying offences. However, there are some offenders for whom only a life sentence will provide the public with the protection that they need.<br><br>
Of course, a life sentence is not necessarily a sentence to life imprisonment. The judge sets the relevant part—the minimum time to be spent in custody for punishment and deterrence. Release will be a matter for the parole board sitting as a tribunal, chaired by one of its judicial members, and the court will not have to impose a life sentence when there are exceptional circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was condemning amendment No. 5, but will he repeat what he said, because the gist of it seemed to be that amendment No. 5 would virtually let people get away with it? We are simply saying that the court should have discretion—that is the meaning of replacing "shall" with "may". Will the Minister go over that point again, because it is important to be clear about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 5 would remove the obligation on the High Court to pass an automatic life sentence on repeat offenders. The clause will not be taking away the judge's discretion, because the judge can specify the relevant part—the minimum period that the offender must spend in prison—which allows him to take account of all the relevant circumstances. He will not have to impose an automatic life sentence if there are exceptional circumstances, as we have already discussed.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must clarify this point. The Minister talks about life sentences, but as was said last Thursday, life does not mean life—there will be early releases—we have demolished that aspect of the argument. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 would give the courts more discretion so that they could impose more severe sentences if necessary. The Government have adopted a populist view that life means life, but it does not. The message going from the Committee today should show that that is not the case: it is not the political truth that life means life. Taking power away from the judges would mean that the most appropriate sentences—in some cases, they could be more severe—will therefore not be imposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The judges will still have the power to specify the minimum period. An automatic life sentence means that the individual involved will not come out of prison while he is a threat to the community. That is the important test that should be applied by the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Govan raised, very relevantly, the delay in bringing drug dealers to court. Someone charged with drug trafficking would almost certainly be detained in custody by the police and would appear in court on the next lawful day. If the accused is placed on petition and is remanded in custody on indictment, an indictment must be served within 80 days. If that person is released on bail, the accused must be brought to trial within 12 months. In either case, the accused can be brought before the court within weeks if he or she intimates an intention to plead guilty.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the difficulty in obtaining information. If he can give me some details, I shall certainly follow up the matter. However, certain information is not always revealed because of the need to avoid witness intimidation. I shall look into those particular circumstances if the hon. Gentleman can give me all the facts and details.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking this information so that I can intimidate witnesses, nor do I intend to make any such information available to anyone else, lest there be any misunderstanding. It is my understanding that the police are currently obliged to refuse to give a Member of Parliament like myself information on individual cases in circumstances where that information is held electronically under the Data Protection Act 1984.<br><br>
I would be grateful if the Minister would also clarify this point. I am told by local police officers that some people who have been charged are waiting for up to two years before they come to court. If I understood him correctly, the Minister's version seemed to be that the maximum period was 12 months—he used several legal terms that I did not fully understand. It would be helpful if he told us in words of one syllable whether it is possible for someone who has been charged to wait for up to two years before appearing in court. Does the Minister recognise that, in principle, such a wait is unlikely to be a deterrent?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Cases should be brought to court as quickly as possible and disposed of as quickly as possible; we regard that as central to the interests of justice. I said that if the accused is released on bail, he or she must be brought to trial within 12 months, and if the accused is placed on petition and remanded in custody, an indictment has to be served within 80 days—to bring him or her to the High Court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What are the current guidelines on bail in the case of a drug dealer who has been charged, released on bail and charged again?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Guidelines have been issued by the law officers. I shall inquire as to whether they can be obtained and issued to members of the Committee. I think that the hon. Member for Govan was sent those guidelines some time ago by the Lord Advocate.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 22 and 25 would render clause 2 meaningless.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is meaningless.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It certainly is not meaningless; it means a great deal. As amended, however, it would do no more than confirm, quite unnecessarily, that the High Court could do what it may already do: impose a seven-year sentence on anyone convicted of trafficking in class A drugs. A High Court judge faced with a sentencing decision in respect of someone who has been convicted of class A drugs offences may impose a custodial sentence of any length up to life imprisonment. That is true whether he is dealing with a first or a repeat offender.<br><br>
I expect clause 2 to be supported by those whose lives or families have been torn apart by the activities of those who traffic in the hardest drugs—what we know as class A drugs, such as heroin and cocaine. When, for instance, the High Court is faced with a heroin dealer who already has two convictions for dealing in similar drugs—a dealer who has taken a deliberate decision to continue to cause misery and harm—we intend that the court shall, not may, impose a minimum sentence of seven years. However, we allow that there may be exceptional circumstances which, in the court's opinion, justify its not passing a sentence of that length.<br><br>
The amendments alone suffice to make it clear that the Opposition are not of the view that an automatic lengthy minimum prison sentence is appropriate for those who repeatedly and unrepentently deal in the hardest of drugs. I therefore ask Opposition members of the Committee not to press their amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has said, a judge can already send someone to the gaol for 10, even 20 years, depending on his view of the seriousness of the crime. Members of the Committee therefore need to be clear about what advantage the Minister sees in proposing clause 2 at all. He says that Opposition members of the Committee do not take the issue seriously, but he seems also to be saying that judges cannot be trusted to take drug trafficking seriously enough to impose heavy sentences. Is that the message that the Minister wants to convey?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that additional protections need to be put in place for the public against those who traffic in class A drugs. I believe that seven years is an appropriate period. Any figure is arbitary to some degree, but our choice of the seven-year minimum was based on a measured assessment and reaction to levels of sentencing for drug offenders across the United Kingdom. At present, sentences tend to range between three and five years. We propose a significant increase in the minimum sentence for third-time offenders. There is nothing to prevent the courts from giving a first-time offender 10 years, but we think that seven years is an appropriate minimum sentence for a third-time offender. It has a parallel in the Home Secretary's Bill: we think it advisable to look at such matters on a British basis, given the mobility of the offenders concerned and of cross-border drug trafficking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the choice of seven years was based on a measured assessment. Can the Committee get access to that assessment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Members of Parliament are entitled to make a balanced judgment in the light of all relevant circumstances. I told the hon. Gentleman that, in most cases, the sentencing for drug trafficking falls between three and five years. That fits in with what the hon. Member for Govan said—that he wants the wholesalers to be dealt with. If three to five years is insufficient for the wholesalers, as we believe it is—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Dundee, East must be quiet. The Minister is addressing the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the matter raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. We cannot take seriously amendments, such as Nos. 23 and 24, which propose a five-year minimum for some and a ten-year minimum for others. We must resist the temptation to overbid in such serious matters. Class A drug traffickers sentenced for the first, second or third time tend to receive sentences of between three and five years. The seven-year minimum represents a reasonable, measured reaction. We are establishing a minimum sentence: the court can impose more.<br><br>
I do not accept that it is appropriate to set a precedent, for the first time and only in respect of this offence, for drawing a specific distinction between the length of sentence that we envisage that a court will pass on people aged between 18 and 21, and the length that it will confer on people aged over 21. The reason is that offending reaches a peak at the ages of 18 and 19. We do not see the logic of the step approach, which the amendments would achieve. Public protection must be paramount when an offender is convicted for the third time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said earlier that the average sentence for dealing is three to five years. Presumably, those figures are an average of all first, second, third and fourth convictions, and so on. What
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
is the average sentence for people convicted for a third offence? How does that vary from the proposed seven years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would need notice of that question, but I accept the principle that the wholesalers must be dealt with more severely and that the public needs to be protected.<br><br>
Dealing in drugs is one of the most corrosive and damaging crimes. It destroys individuals, families and entire communities. Drug traffickers wreak their harm on countless victims. This evil trade claims more victims that almost any other tye of offence. That is why we must put in place the necessary protections to defend people from disreputable peddlers of misery and death.<br><br>
When the parents of children who had lost their lives in that way came to see me they told me that they wanted strong measures to be put in place. We want the drug dealers to have a long time to think about what they have done. We want to free the public from the scourge of drugs by removing dealers from our communities. The introduction of minimum sentences for repeat drug dealers is a vital weapon in the fight against drugs in our community. The new minimum sentences will not only ensure fitting punishment; they will act as a deterrent and safeguard the public. I look forward to Opposition Members supporting these clauses when we vote on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Minister would take an intervention, Mr. Martin, but although I tried several times to intervene he seemed unable to leave his script and enter into a debate.<br><br>
The Minister spoke about class A drugs, but mentioned only cocaine and heroin. Clearly, cocaine and heroin have the reputation—probably correct—of being extremely damaging and addictive. Evidence given to the Scottish Grand Committee confirmed that, but there was also a lot of evidence about Ecstasy, which is also a class A drug. It is also known as MDMA and MDMB, and sadly caused deaths at raves in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ayr. We have been told that those who took it reacted randomly, just as some people react randomly to penicillin. Indeed, as many people have died from taking penicillin—a prescription drug—as have died from taking Ecstasy. Did the Minister deliberately leave Ecstasy off his list? Is the trafficking of cocaine and heroin the most severe offence? Or will people who traffick in any class A drug, including party drugs, be treated in the same way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Class A drugs have the same meaning here as in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and Ecstasy is rightly covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that because it allows me to express another concern. Our blanket scaremongering approach to drugs is so poor that we are becoming an irrelevance to many young people and our attempts at legislation seem pointless to them. They see drugs put into different categories in every analysis—we talk of heroin as a class A drug. There is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
much debate to be had about that, but everyone is ducking the issue because of the emotional nature of the deaths at Hanger 13.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are drifting when we talk about the drugs involved in convictions. We are dealing with amendments on convictions—not with whether drug dealing has taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin, because that leads me onto another concern. The Minister did not set out clear guidelines in response to questions from my hon. Friend the Member for Govan about what determines who is a major drugs dealer. Would the amount of drugs involved determine whether someone was a drug trafficker and not someone who bought drugs for his own pleasure or to pass on to a couple of friends? Would circumstances make someone a major trafficker? Would he be a major dealer if he was involved in violence or in a gang or network of dealers? What about an individual who regularly sells drugs to a small group of people? Would the context in which the individual was caught determine our approach? What if someone sells through a network or chain and people come in, pay their money, get their slip of paper and go to the next house, where they get another slip of paper and so on until they make the deal. The Minister said that the sentences would apply to a major trafficking offence, but he has not told us what such an offence would be. He said that all class A drugs would be covered, regardless of whether they were bought and passed on for partying or intended to hook someone. Is he saying that there is no difference? Such an approach makes us look foolish in the eyes of people who regularly take party drugs and does us no credit. If we have no credibility, our work here will be undermined. The sentences that the Minister has talked about will be seen as arbitrary and illogical and the Bill will be a nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I asked the Minister about the present level of sentences for third-time offenders, he said that he required prior notice to answer my question. Will he reply subsequently or were his remarks simply a means of avoiding giving an answer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Rather than letting the Minister reply, I shall do so. The Minister may reply to a question later only if that is in order. This is a large group of amendments and I have given members of the Committee some leeway, but they must be more specific in their questions. The issue of bail or when people are called to trial is not germane to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to focus specifically on the amendments—especially amendments Nos. 22 to 25, which deal with repeat offenders. We believe that there should be a mandatory sentence of seven years for such offenders. When my hon. Friend the Member for Govan legitimately asked about the current average sentence imposed upon repeat offenders, the Minister said that he required notice of that question. That
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
means that we shall be voting on amendments without knowing whether we are reducing or increasing the average sentence for such offenders. The Minister does not know whether the current average is above or below seven years. How can we vote rationally on the amendments when the Minister cannot tell us the current state of play?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not here to defend the Minister, but that is not the Minister's problem. After all, the Opposition tabled the amendments. The information to which the hon. Member for Dundee, East refers could have been obtained prior to tabling the amendments or before the Committee sat. Such information cannot really be expected during the to and fro of our sitting.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It applies equally to the Minister. If I were to produce a Bill suggesting a mandatory sentence of seven years, I would want to know whether that represented an increase or a decrease in current average sentences. If the Minister does not know that, why is the Bill before the Committee at all?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. At this stage, we are debating amendments rather than Bills. Does the Minister want to reply?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to provide a breakdown for each category of sentence and I will endeavour to obtain that information. We need time to gather the figures and to ensure that they are absolutely right.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Gentleman with certainty that the courts generally impose three to five years for repeat offenders; a lesser sentence is imposed for first-time offenders. That provides a rough-and-ready picture. As I said, I shall obtain a more detailed breakdown later. We firmly believe that stronger measures should be put in place.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Government raised the issue of wholesalers who push drugs. We must remember that such dealers often do not take the drugs themselves. We are more concerned with the wholesalers than with minor operators. It is for the Lord Advocate to specify the charges on the indictment and to advise which court is appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Minister has provided us with the average figures for repeat offending. Clause 2, however, deals with third offences—repeat may mean one repeat, not two repeats. We can only assume that the Minister, when he brought forward the Bill, was aware of a typical sentence for a third offence. Otherwise, why bring the Bill forward in the first place?<br><br>
My point of order, Mr. Martin, is that while these matters may not be strictly relevant to the amendments, they are germane to a stand part debate on the clause. That would give the Minister time in the afternoon sitting to provide the information that we seek. Am I right?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0076">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The more time that the Minister gets, the clearer will be the information that is provided. That would apply to any hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister also said—when he spoke against the amendment that would have introduced differential sentences for different ages—that 18 to 19-year-olds were the largest group of offenders. I am not sure whether he is saying that they are the largest group of third offenders. The Minister would recognise the difference, so it would be helpful if, before the stand part debate, the Minister could clarify that issue. Were those 18 to 19-year-olds the largest group of offenders for first, second or third-offences? Would he also clarify the average age of third offenders to the nearest decade? Would that group be caught by rules applying differential sentences for under-21s?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am still interested in the Minister's lack of precision. In relation to the sentences he mentioned—between three and five years for repeat offenders—when he does his research, will he find out whether we can be told whether the judges have been giving lower or higher sentences for offences involving different types of drugs? Are the judges distinguishing between offences involving a class A drug that is an intoxicant, such as Ecstacy; a class A drug that is an addictive depresant, such as heroin or cocaine; and the supply of large amounts of hashish or marijuana?<br><br>
The Minister related the dates and times of the Maguire case can cited it as an example where a mandatory and automatic sentence would have kept a person behind bars, using the words "such time as we were satisfied that he was not a danger to the public". Why was he allowed out after two thirds of his sentence? Could not he have been kept in to the end of the sentence under the old rules? If he had been kept in under them, would he have been out after 10 years, would he have committed the second offence—for which he was not prosecuted—and would he have committed the murder? If he had been in for the full 10 years under that sentencing regime, would he have been at liberty in time to commit his crimes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have nothing substantial to add, except that Maguire received a determinate sentence. There will be an additional protection for the public under the Bill's provisions, in that such a man would not come out of prison until he was considered to be no longer a threat to the community. As it was, he came out after two thirds of the determinate sentence. Under the Bill there will be a much stronger protection for the public. That is the justification for the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We cannot accept the Minister's proposition that there will be stronger protection under the Bill; in fact, it will add nothing. I refer the Minister back to section 13 of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may make rules for regulating the supervision of any description of person released, under this Part of this Act on licence."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
Have those regulations been laid? If not, why not? I offer the Minister the co-operation of the Opposition on such regulations which would supervise any person released. That is what we have been asking for with the Maguire and the Cronin cases, in terms of sex offenders. We are happy to co-operate because we do not want people out of prison while they are still a danger to the public. That could have been done under the 1993 Act, if the Government had a mind to do it. That dereliction of duty has led to kneejerk reactions by the Government on the Maguire case.<br><br>
On drug sentences, the Minister talked of the seven-year minimum. I want further information. You, Mr. Martin, said that the longer we gave the Minister the clearer he would be. We are happy to camp here all night, but the proposition may be found wanting because we have had very few answers. He said that seven years was based on a range of sentences from across the United Kingdom. Will he therefore tell us the penalties in England, in Scotland and in Northern Ireland?<br><br>
Has the Minister has picked the period of seven years at random? Would early release apply to it? Could a person be imprisoned not for seven years, but for five years and 10 months?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mysteriously, a document has been passed to me by a member of the Department of the Serjeant at Arms. I have been asked to study tables 13 and 14 which show that drug offences in 1995 numbered 685 and that sentences of four years and more numbered 412. Will the Minister say how many of the 412 sentences were for more than seven years and how many for less? Unless we have that information, the Committee cannot vote on the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. That goes to the heart of what the Government are trying to do. They say that they are tough on crime. We have been told first that life does not mean life. Now we do not know whether drugs offences will increase or decease. That is the issue at stake. The Government have been disingenuous in their approach to the situation.<br><br>
On the issue of severe injury, the Minister said, if I remember correctly, that Crown counsel will act as a collegiate body. However, it is up to a procurator fiscal to put the case to Crown counsel, so the procurator fiscal has a role in assessing what severe injury is. Again, there will be a lottery aspect. I have asked the Minister for his comments on that.<br><br>
Regarding supervision for longer sentences, we say that it should be 10 years for over 21s, first because of the deterrent effect, and secondly, because it is appropriate for older offenders who have committed prior offences. On amendment No. 7, we say that the period should be five years for under 21s because we consider it to be proportionate to the age of the offender and it operates at the lower end of an increasing scale of penalties. We suggest that it would be a deterrent because an 18-year-old who is locked up for five years will be given, first, a taste of prison, and secondly, the effective deterrent that next time he will get a more severe sentence.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0077">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could explain to me—I have difficulty in following his logic—why someone who is 18, allowed to vote and able to serve in the military is different from somebody who is 21. I thought that the age of maturity, for example for voting, was 18.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but he, unlike me, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of State, is not part of the Scotland Against Drugs campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But I am.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Government came to us about that campaign, they said, "The issue is too great for us to solve so we are looking for the co-operation of Opposition parties and others. We want to tell young people that drugs are a severe issue and that some who are taking drugs do not realise the problems that they will have, so we want an educational input. We realise from campaigns that we had 10 years ago, such as the "just say no" campaign and its horrific adverts, that that was the wrong message, so we have got to go into schools. We are targeting young people differently from adults." That is happening in the Scotland Against Drugs campaign. I ask the Minister to consider that because he wants a co-operative approach.<br><br>
Supervised release orders come under section 209 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which reenacts the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993. The court can put serious offenders under a supervised release order if it considers it necessary to protect the public from them. The Bill, which is defective, would mean that those on longer sentences are not under such orders because at the time of sentencing the court would have to have the presence of mind to impose a supervised release order. Surely that is a defect in the system. We ask the Minister to address that issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will come to supervised release orders under clause 3 in a moment and will consider them at that time. I can only repeat what I said earlier—the 1993 Act would not prevent automatic release at two thirds of the sentence; for example, in Maguire's case. The 1993 Act supervision ends when the determinate sentence ends. Under the Bill, there would be a supervised release order potentially for a long period, and licence conditions would remain for life.<br><br>
With regard to drugs, I was asked whether early release applies to drugs offences. Clause 28(1) applies the early release provisions to all determinate sentences, including those passed under clause 2.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have asked three times about section 13 of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993. Has the Secretary of State made the
<br><blockquote><p>"rules for regulating the supervision of any description of person released"?</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
If those regulations have not been laid down, why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will obtain that information and let the hon. Gentleman know this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What kind of a Government is this? I ask the Minister who put the 1993 Act through Parliament whether a provision in it has been laid and he cannot tell us. As a result, we cannot get answers from on high.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. My understanding is that Committee members should address the Committee through the Chair. The hon. Gentleman seems to be addressing the wall at the opposite end of the Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the hon. Member for Dumbarton has his back to the Chair. However, the regulations that he is discussing do not really tie in with the group of amendments before us. If a matter is outwith the scope of the amendments, it should be raised elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member for Ayr is growing brave—he did not table his amendment about murder, but he has come up with something.<br><br>
I am asking about section 13 of the 1993 Act because the Minister is specifically discussing the Gavin Maguire case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister mentioned the Maguire case because the hon. Member for Dumbarton raised it and asked for a reply. I can conduct the Committee in two ways: I could be so firm that the hon. Gentleman would be able to discuss only "shall" and "may", but that would mean restricting the Committee. I allowed the Gavin Maguire matter to be discussed for clarification purposes. If the hon. Member for Dumbarton claims that the Gavin Maguire case allows him to mention section 13, that is not on. I will have to rule strictly according to law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I would certainly not want to go outwith your ruling, but I look forward to a quick answer from the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman putting his amendment to the vote?</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 2, line 22, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) Where a person has been sentenced pursuant to subsection (2) above and the court considers that it is appropriate—
<ol>
<li>if he has attained the age of 21 years he shall spend not less than one year in a State hospital or a hospital for the treatment of mental illness or mental handicap; and</li>
<li>if he has attained the age of 18 years but is under the age of 21 years he shall attend an approved course of treatment.".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 111, in page 2, line 27, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'''approved course of treatment" means a programme of therapy and counselling approved by regulation made by statutory instrument by the Secretary of the State which is designed to address problems of offending behaviour.'</p></blockquote>
No. 68, in page 4, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) Where the court has passed a sentence pursuant to subsection (2) above, it shall also require the person sentenced to attend an approved drug-awareness programme.'.</p></blockquote>
No. 69 in page 4, line 46, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'''approved drug awareness programme" means a programme of instruction and counselling in relation to the abuse of drugs which is approved by regulation made by statutory instrument by the Secretary of State.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have over many years given much thought to the purposes that the Government said were behind their many Bills and Acts and about whether those purposes were realised. I have great doubts about the Bill, which is about sentencing and protecting the public from people who commit multiple crimes of the same nature. I agree that those crimes are anti-social and often hideous. They are executed by people who are not of sane mind—which is not to say they are unfit to plead. Even the Government recognise the distinction, as is made clear in their proposals for dealing with mentally disordered offenders, which appear later in the Bill.<br><br>
The Government said that automatic and mandatory sentencing will be the great saviour for the public. Amendment No. 112 states that if a person
<br><blockquote><p>"has attained the age of 21 years he shall spend not less than one year in a State hospital or a hospital for the treatment of mental illness or mental handicap; and … if he has attained the age of 18 years but is under the age of 21 years he shall attend an approved course of treatment",</p></blockquote>
but not necessarily in a specified area.<br><br>
Amendment No. 11 states:
<br><blockquote><p>'''approved course of treatment' means a programme of therapy and counselling approved by regulation made by statutory instrument by the Secretary of State which is designed to address problems of offending behaviour."</p></blockquote>
We are discussing what any Government should do when people are taken from the public domain for the public's protection. Protecting the public, as has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
already been said, has never been achieved simply by putting people in prison and screwing down the lid. The more vicious and hard-disciplined the regime, the more likely a person is to come out alienated and displaying more anti-social behaviour; he will have learned to be a better criminal and to be tough. He will have taken his sentence standing on his head, as people who go in and out of prison and show recidivist behaviour might say. The amendments propose an alternative.<br><br>
I have given the matter much thought. Some of my hon. Friends have told me not to consider only my experience—I hope that I do not do so when taking part in discussions and making legislation. However, one cannot run away from one's own experiences, and I must tell the Committee about mine. In December 1977 my young cousin, Agnes Cooney, was leaving a club in Glasgow—she was probably in your constituency, Mr. Martin. She missed the last bus and thumbed a lift home, but she never arrived. Several days later she was found in a field near Greengairs. She had starved to death. My family and my uncle—whom I hold in very high regard; he is a good, church-going man—reacted by wanting to turn into murderers. If they had caught the person who did it, they would have wanted to murder him on the spot. That feeling stayed with my family for many years, and we debated what we should do with the murderer.<br><br>
I must be perfectly honest. My two remaining uncles and my mother are still convinced that the Yorkshire ripper killed Agnes Cooney. He had a girlfriend in Greengairs—she now lives in the village of Slamannan, which is in my constituency—and he was a regular visitor in his lorry to that part of the world. The debate has gone on for a long time. My hon. Friends might say that I should not take my own experiences into account, but, having been involved in the debate for so long, I have to ask how one should treat such people. How does one deal with people who carry out such hideous crimes? The Yorkshire ripper is now behind bars for other cases that were brought to court. It seems to me that one can never solve the problem while such people are being released. The Minister has said time and again that in the Bill life does not mean life. People who commit such offences—serious sexual offences, attempted murders or murders—will return to society when, as the Minister will say, they are no longer considered to be a danger to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that that is not necessarily the case? Some people may remain a physical threat and danger to other individuals in the community for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that those people spend their time locked up in state mental institutions. Most people who are put away for the duration of their lives are considered to be so unstable and uncontrollable that they are mentally ill and are put into mental institutions. That is appropriate and I applaud sentencing that admits that some people are so unstable that they require permanent treatment.<br><br>

The amendment states that anyone who commits the type of crime that we are discussing should be listed. There are some questions in my mind about whether people who traffic in drugs are necessarily mentally ill. They may just be driven by the greed that society has generated about getting rich quick. That is why I asked my earlier question about guidelines. If violence, organised crime and risk to other individuals were involved in the trafficking, would the offence fit into the category? It would certainly fit into the category with which I believe that the amendments should be dealing, which is that people who are so mentally disturbed, antisocial and anomic that they are willing to live outwith the rules of society—and even to justify that logically to themselves—should be seen by society as mentally unstable and mentally unfit and should undergo some period of analysis. Earlier the Minister said that in prison no one need attend the STOP programme for multiple sexual offenders. I believe that everyone who commits that kind of offence should compulsorily undergo psychiatric analysis and psychiatric treatment and should undergo an approved course of treatment. That should be society's contribution but it is not—because it costs money. We should be putting resources into genuinely trying to solve the problems of multiple offending rather than spending fewer resources by slamming people up in prisons.<br><br>
We have never had a decent debate in any Standing Committee on the role of psychiatric treatment in multiple offending behaviour. It is important that the Govenment focus on it. I hope that they consider the purpose of the amendment and take it on board. Had it been possible, in terms that the procurator fiscal found acceptable, to put a finger on the person who so starkly killed my young cousin, that person would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
have been ill and would have required analysis and treament as well as incarceration. I am glad to say that that murder did not involve any sexual behaviour—it involved a single knife wound—although I think that that was because it was committed during my cousin's menstrual cycle and not because of any compassion on the part of the murderer.<br><br>
Psychiatric help is not an alternative to prison but should be a fundamental aspect of every sentence for multiple offending. I think that the public believe that someone has to be seriously sick to commit that kind of murder or sexual offence once and seriously disturbed permanently—in a way that requires treatment—to do it twice or more. The Government are not willing to recognise that.<br><br>
The Government have an opportunity to do something sensible. They could really try to stop reoffending behaviour after the period of incarceration instead of trying to secure bylines and sound bites about being tough on crime. To be tough on crime, one should try to enter the criminal's mind and to change that criminal behaviour.<br><br>
All the evidence we have heard—today we heard it from the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross and previously we have heard it from my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton and from debates on the Floor of the House—suggests that tougher regimes do not reduce the amount of crime in the long run. All they do is lock people up for longer and then release them into society, thereby creating an environment where there is tougher, harder, more despairing, more alienated and more anomic behaviour from people who come out of prison. My understanding is that it is easier to get drugs inside than outside prison.</span></p>
