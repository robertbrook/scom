</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) to the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are delighted that, after years of coaxing, the hon. and learned Gentleman has at last joined the Committee. We look forward to his contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society was concerned that clause 1(5) might in some circumstances place on it a duty to provide documents that it did not have and had no powers to obtain, or which it did have but which were confidential. Amendments Nos. 3 to 5 put matters beyond doubt and ensure that the Law Society is required to provide only information that is within its knowledge or documents that are within its possession
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
or control. The amendments also make it absolutely clear that the duty to provide documents supersedes any other duties of confidentiality to which the professional organisation or practitioner might be subject. That addresses Law Society concerns that it might in some circumstances leave itself open to challenge if it passed confidential documents to the ombudsman. Under the amendments, the provision of the documents to the ombudsman could not be legally challenged on the ground of breach of confidentiality. The amendments are clearly in the interests of the person who makes the original complaint and who wishes to see a full and complete investigation of its handling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To cover the small number of cases in which a relevant document is not in the professional organisation's possession or control, amendment No. 6 gives the ombudsman the power to go directly to the practitioner. The practitioner would be required to provide the ombudsman with the information or document, if he had it, notwithstanding any duty of confidentiality that would otherwise apply. The amendments are designed to ensure that the ombudsman can obtain all the available information that he considers he needs for his investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that I received my early training in a shipyard, not in the law faculty at Glasgow. How does the Minister define "confidential documents"? Would such documents include medical or hospital notes and, if so, can he confirm that the parliamentary ombudsman has to seek the permission of the complainer before such confidential documents are handed over?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, there can be no question of asking medical practitioners to break the Hippocratic oath and we would not want to do that. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the ombudsman can ask only for documents that are relevant to the investigations and to the professional organisation involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might help the Committee if I give one or two assurances that the Law Society sought on the amendments. The first is that the amendments give the ombudsman the power to require only the production of such information or documents as are relevant to the investigation of the professional organisation's handling of a complaint. The ombudsman does not investigate the original complaint about the practitioner and would have no power to require any document relevant to that unless it had a bearing on how the professional organisation handled the complaint.The investigation is about the way that it was handled. Accordingly, the power will not interfere in any way with the legal profession's principle of self-regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, to avoid any possibility of misuse of information obtained either from a professional
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
organisation or a practitioner, I give the undertaking that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland will direct the ombudsman to use only information or documents that are obtained in the exercise of his powers in connection with his statutory functions and to ensure that his staff do likewise. Those directions wi6ll be made under schedule 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990. The Secretary of State's present directions are printed at the end of the Scottish legal services ombudsman's annual report, which is available to members of the Committee. I must again stress that the entitlement is to investigate the handling of complaints, not the complaints themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's clarification of the circumstances in which documents should be produced is welcome. The fact that such a clarification was offered to us at the start of our first sitting may indicate the way that the Bill was drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to confidentiality, the Minister has not dealt with the matter that I raised on Second Reading in the Scottish Grand Committee. Although I appreciate that the Law Society of Scotland has expressed itself satisfied, that society is not the Parliament of the United Kingdom and it does not have the duties of scrutiny that we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled amendments Nos. 20 and 21 to ascertain whether the Minister understands the consequences of his proposal. Essentially, the proposal is to give a power to an appointed official—however well intentioned or well qualified he or she may be—unless it is satisfied that that power is necessary and that its scope is adequate. We should never give the powers that are open ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister sought to deal with some apprehensions by saying that the Secretary of State will give directions to the ombudsman about how he should exercise the Bill's powers. In particular, he will give directions about relevancy in relation to a complaint of mishandling that the ombudsman may be investigating. Those directions may be persuasive, but they are not binding. The ombudsman operates within the context of the Act that authorises him to proceed. With regard to relevancy, he makes the initial judgement about what is or is not relevant—indeed, according to one view, he has the final judgement on that matter. If the Government's view is that the exercise of that judgment about relevancy is to be circumscribed in some way, that should be included in the Bill. That circumscription should not be included in directions that the Secretary of State for Scotland may issue, whether that is done in relation to schedule 3 of the 1990 Act or included—perhaps for convenience—in the final pages of the ombudsman's annual report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendments would protect confidential information that is in the hands of professional organisations or individual practitioners. I must make it clear that my proposal is not a protection for lawyers
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
or their professional organisations: it is for individual members of the public, about whom there may be information or documents that are in the possession either of an organisation or a practitioner and that are otherwise confidential. That might include, for example, medical records or information that is gathered under the subscription of confidentiality, if I may put it that way. The Government recognise that confidentiality is likely to be an issue in this matter—otherwise, they would not have expressly included in the Bill a provision to the effect that the power of the ombudsman overrides any duty of confidentiality that the practitioner may owe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not override that duty of confidentiality. The relationship between a legal practitioner and his or her client is the only relationship that is protected by law. If, during the course of evidence in court, a legal practitioner is asked any question about his relationship with a client, he is entitled to refuse to answer it. Someone in a confessional, who has heard the confession of a criminal, does not have that protection. As a matter of policy, it is very unlikely that priests would be forced to divulge what is said to them but, as a matter of law, they do not have the protection that is afforded to the relationship between a legal practitioner and his or her client.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question to the Minister about the definition of confidentiality in relation to medical records was prompted by the case of a constituent who sought compensation through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. I would have thought that there were medical notes of some kind among those papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right that, of course, medical records may be global in that they may deal not simply with the occasion on which a person has his face slashed or his teeth knocked out, as a result of which he applies to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, but also with previous medical history, which could include information that the person does not wish to divulge. In the case of a woman, the matter may be even more sensitive for a whole variety of reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the Government want to provide that the power of the ombudsman overrides all questions of confidentiality. That is an interesting power, and it would be interesting to know whether either of the other two ombudsmen have similar powers. As far as I am aware, the local government ombudsman does not have the power to override confidentiality and, perhaps more relevant to members of the Committee, the parliamentary commissioner—commonly referred to as the ombudsman—does not have that power either. We are entitled to ask why the legal services ombudsman is so special that we are asked to give him a power to override a fundamental principle of the legal system, when the other ombudsmen—some might say, with equally important responsibilities—are not to be given that power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that the parliamentary ombudsman must seek the agreement of the complainer before such documents are handed over to him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that to be the case. If I were aggrieved by the way in which a complaint against a legal practitioner had been handled and applied to the legal services ombudsman for redress, inviting him to investigate the handling of the complaint, by implication, it could be argued with some force that I had given up the right to confidentiality. But there are other circumstances in which a legal practitioner may hold papers that are entitled to the virtue of confidentiality, and which would be subject to the measure that the Minister proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Committee a practical example. Two people are involved, as passengers, in a road traffic accident and sue the driver of the car in which they were travelling but, for one reason or another, the action does not proceed properly and they are dissatisfied with the way in which their solicitor has conducted the case. They apply to the Law Society of Scotland to complain about that and are dissatisfied with the way in which it handles their complaint. They then apply to the ombudsman who says, "I want all the files connected with this case."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the two passengers, only one wishes to persist with his or her complaint to the ombudsman, but the papers held by the practitioner include the medical reports of both. If the person who is conjoined to the original action for damages for personal injuries decides not to proceed with the complaint against the solicitor who is thought to have handled the case inappropriately or ineffectively and his or her fellow passenger continues to pursue it, the ombudsman will ask for all the files and papers held by the practitioner. He will receive not just medical records relevant to the person persisting with the complaint but the medical records of the other passenger. The practitioner cannot say "These records are confidential between me and passenger No. 2." As the complaint of passenger No. 1 is the subject of the investigation, he cannot stand on that confidential relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The medical records may contain material which a man or a woman would not want to reach public domain. It will be said that all ombudsmen, by definition, are reasonable men who will act responsibly and whose motivations are proper, and that there will be no negligence in the way in which they deal with complaints. Such assertions are always made when an extension of power is offered and people otherwise minded question to that extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill did not properly address the issue of confidentiality. The Government are now saying that confidentiality—this is a pejorative way of putting it—
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
may simply be swept aside. Amendment No. 20 would provide that a practitioner or organisation is not obliged to provide information or documents unless that individual or organisation is entitled in law to do so—that is, when they are not bound by any principle of confidentiality. Amendment No. 21 would provide that when an issue arises between the ombudsman and the practitioner or organisation, either can go to the sheriff under the summary procedure, which is designed to be short and sharp, and ask for an order of the court to determine the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of confidentiality should not be easily and lightly overridden. If an issue arises between the ombudsman and the practitioner or organisation, there should be a way to resolve it. My two amendments would better protect the interests not just of those who complain to the ombudsman about the handling of their complaint by the Law Society of Scotland, but of third parties who may not have made any such complaint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leigh)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may intrude on this argument between lawyers. In general, we welcome the extended powers given to the legal services ombudsman. It is important that all available information should be obtainable by the ombudsman. It is significant that the citizens advice body in Scotland and the Scottish Consumers Council wrote to me and, no doubt, to other members of the Committee telling us not to water down powers in the Bill. They are totally behind the Bill and do not want it weakened by amendments. Although the Law Society had initial reservations, it too has accepted that the rewording is satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concerns about confidentiality raised by the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East. If he was concerned about confidentiality, he should have tabled an amendment that was related specifically to confidentiality. The amendments that he has tabled are not confined to the issue of confidentiality. He has already argued against himself by admitting that, if a client went to the legal services ombudsman to seek an investigation on his or her behalf, he or she would wish that all relevant documents be studied because that would be in his or her interests. He then went on to give a more complicated example relating to a car accident. I think that the word "relevant" is relevant to that example because only relevant documents would have to be handed over. The documents to which the hon. and learned Gentleman referred would not be relevant to that particular investigation. I am sympathetic to the points about confidentiality, which has been dealt with in two ways. It is in the client's interest that only relevant documents are handed over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the far more general implications of "entitled in law". As I am not a lawyer, I am not sure exactly how much is captured by the phrase, but it does not seem to me that it would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
forbid the handing over of confidential documents. It may sabotage the wider purpose of the Bill, which, when all is said and done, is to help the client. In many ways, the Bill does not go far enough to help clients and those who have a complaint against the legal profession. However, the intention of the Bill is to help clients and it seems to me that the amendments would act against that. I shall listen to the hon. and learned Gentleman's reply and see whether he can persuade me that "entitled in law" is restricted purely to issues of confidentiality. I do not understand why he did not table an amendment to insert words such as "you would have to seek the agreement of the complainer", which would be a specific amendment as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman). However, that is not what the amendments say and I am concerned that, as worded at the moment, the amendments would severely restrict the increased powers of the ombudsman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Minister and the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman on that point. In all the years that we have been in Parliament, during which the parliamentary commissioners for various services have been introduced, most Members of Parliament have found the greatest difficulty in getting a complaint to stick. One receives a very helpful and detailed letter back from the ombudsman to whom one is writing, giving a thousand and one reasons why he is not able to investigate that particular complaint. It would be wrong to water down anything in the amendments of my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister that might reduce the effectiveness of the ombudsman in investigating a full and detailed complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should speed up the whole process. One seems to have parliamentary commissioners' cases going on for months, and even years, before one gets a conclusion, which is very often that he cannot look into it. It is important that we go ahead positively to show the public that we want genuine cases investigated. To do that, the commissioner must have all the information at his fingertips.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully, in particular to the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East. I have had some difficulty with constituents getting at the facts about their relations with some solicitors. I welcome the measures in the Bill because they would deal with the problems that I have encountered, on which I have not been able to obtain satisfaction over a long period of time. I am confident that, if an ombudsman had had the powers that the Bill proposes to give him, the matters that I have been working on—in one case for two years—would have been resolved more effectively and quickly. That is what we should be addressing. Are we trying to find ways to deal with the problems that our constituents have had with solicitors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the point made by the right hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), I cannot believe that cases taken to the ombudsman take years to settle. In the first case that I took to Mr. Reid, the parliamentary ombudsman, he found in a severe way against the Department of Social Security and in favour of my constituent, a young pregnant teenager, who had been treated most harshly by the Department. After only a short inquiry, M. Reid came down on the side of the young claimant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to defend the legal profession against individual complainers. Individuals must be given as much conservative professions, which seek to defend each other. The legal and medical professions are the two most conservative professions with which we deal. We must give the ombudsman the power to deal decisively with members of such professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concerns, which I have raised with the Minister and the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East, centred on the question of confidential documents being given to the ombudsman with the agreement of the complainer. The only point that I want to bring home to the Minister is that the complainer must agree to such documents being given up when they are sought by the ombudsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that when a complainer brings a complaint against a member of the profession or against a local authority, by implication he or she agrees to such documents being handed over to the ombudsman. However, I believe that the ombudsman should obtain the agreement of the complainer in such cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend, I am not in the business of defending any conservative institutions—be they with a small or big "c"—but some of the remarks made by Conservative members of the Committee have persuaded me to rise to my feet this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Tayside and the right hon. Member for Dumfries have said that they want speedy resolution of their complaints. We should not frame the law of Scotland to make it easy for Members of Parliament to resolve cases. It would be a poor state of affairs if we started to frame those laws according to our convenience as Members of Parliament. It would be wrong for us to have laws which made it easier for us to go about our business if they threatened the civil liberties of individuals who were subject to those laws. I was not persuaded by that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have argued that the proposal made by the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East would water down the ombudsman's powers. I do not accept that argument because what is at stake is the right of all citizens to have their affairs treated with confidentiality. It is an issue that affects all our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I understand the argument that someone who applies to the ombudsman forgoes his or her right to confidentiality. The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East gave us an example a case in which someone who had not applied had his or her right to confidentiality breached. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) made the point that only relevant documents fell within that power. However, from my reading of amendment No. 4, it is for the ombudsman to define what is relevant. An ombudsman is not an accountable, elected Member of Parliament. He is appointed by the Government. Like the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East, I do not think that we should give powers to an unaccountable individual to decide what is or is not relevant and to breach the right to confidentiality of people whom we represent.

This is not about watering down or strengthening the powers of the ombudsman. It is about getting the powers of the ombudsman right so that individuals are protected in our society. It is a genuine point, not a party political one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a political point either because the matter is far too serious to be treated in that way. Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that Law Officers in general may not be elected Members of Parliament and that they have substantial powers? Frequently, one's only recourse to get matters dealt with where constituents have had difficulty is through the Lord Advocate, who is not normally elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the Lord Advocate is not normally elected, but as I said, I do not defend conservatives with a small c or a big c, so that is not a problem for me. Perhaps one day when we get a socialist republic the Law Officers will be elected and accountable to the people, but that may be some way off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with an unelected and, in a democratic sense, unaccountable individual and giving him powers that he can use to breach the right of people to have their affairs treated with proper confidentiality under the law. That is dangerous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), encapsulates the issues extremely well. In the unlikely event of him not being here after 1 May, there is a career for him in the legal profession in Scotland or elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fault may be mine—it may be one of expression—but it is a misconception to argue that the amendment waters down the powers of the ombudsman. In no sense does it do that. It protects the right to confidentiality of those who have not sought to put in train the powers that the Bill gives to the ombudsman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, I am sympathetic to the point about confidentiality. However, why did the hon. and learned Gentleman not table an amendment that referred to confidentiality because my understanding is that "entitled in law" will hold back far more documents than simply those that are confidential. I am worried that it will restrict the powers of the ombudsman and therefore the rights of clients to have redress against the legal profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that in a moment. Those of us who are survivors of the long watches of the night when the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill 1990 when through the Committee—the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) was a prominent member of that Committee and managed to persuade the Government to change their mind on the right of appeal in relation to regular extensions of permitted hours—will remember that the provisions for the establishment of a legal services ombudsman were unanimously accepted. It is wholly inaccurate to suggest that I in any way opposed the proper investigation of complaints against either the Law Society of Scotland or the Faculty of Advocates, of which I am a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing more fundamental and important to the confidence of the public in the system of law and in the provision of legal services in Scotland than to know that their complaints will be properly handled. Hon. Members and some of the organisations who have written to the hon. Member for Leith may find that in due course outraged constituents will say, "We had no part in any complaint to the ombudsman, but it seems that in the exercise of his power under the Act, he has taken possession of information relating to me which was entirely confidential." At that point hon. Members may feel that their constituents have a grievance. However, if the measures that the Government propose are accepted, there will be absolutely no way of having such grievances redressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not dealing with those who make the complaint or with protecting the Law Society or the Faculty of Advocates or members of either of those bodies but with protecting the interests of third parties who have not made any complaint. That is the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 20 which contains the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"entitled in law to do so",</p></blockquote>
is apt to deal with confidentiality as well as with any issue arising under any other statute. For example, certain statues regulate the provision or information about children. It is not possible, in certain circumstances, freely to use information in relation to children. Adoption is an example of that. Therefore, the reason for the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"but only so far as it is entitled in law to do so",</p></blockquote>
is to deal with confidentiality, which is the most likely issue to arise, as well as with the fact that there might be statutory restrictions. Other Acts might restrict the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
ability or an individual to use information. That is why the amendment is phrased in such a way. The hon. Member for Leith may be apprehensive about amendment No. 20, but he will appreciate that amendment No. 21 provides expressly that where any question arises about the legality of the provision of information or the production of a document, either the ombudsman, the individual or the organisation can go to the sheriff, using summary procedure, and ask for an order to determine whether the document should be made available or the information provided. If the ombudsman thinks that individuals or institutions are unreasonably or illegally failing to do what they are supposed to do, there is a means to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Dundee, East said—and his point is well taken—the question of relevance falls to be determined under the Bill by the ombudsman. There does not appear to be any effort to introduce a concept of reasonableness. Although the government and other hon. Members might not intend it, the legislation opens up a potentially rich seam of litigation for lawyers. Questions might arise as to whether the power provided by the Bill is being exercised in such a way as entitles it to be described as an abuse of discretion. The whole question of relevancy seems not to provide the bulwark of protection that the Government appear to think that it might. The difficulty of taking a stand on an issue where a wide discretion is afforded to an official is that the official's decision might well be the subject of challenge by way of judicial review in the Court of Session. If we are anxious to get on quickly with processing complaints—an entirely sound and reasonable point of view to take—creating circumstances in which judicial review becomes commonplace will hardly aid their swift passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, when we reach the point at which we must make a decision on such matters, in accordance with the appropriate procedure, I shall test the mood of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Leith, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside for their support for the measure. The purpose is to enable members of the public to make complaints to the ombudsman and for the ombudsman to have the power to investigate them. There is a strong consumer interest. It is in the interests of the complainer for the ombudsman to have access to all the necessary documents, but the ombudsman is concerned only with how the complaint was handled, not with the actual complaint itself. The relevancy test must relate to the handling of the complaint. The ombudsman can ask only for the relevant papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow that medical records are unlikely to be relevant to how the Law Society handled the complaint. The ombudsman cannot make a blanket
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
request for documents; the request must be relevant to how the professional organisation handled the complaint. But we think that it is in the interests of the complainer that the ombudsman has all the relevant information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Medical records could be released only with the consent of the individual concerned. But consent is implied when a complaint is made, provided that the papers are relevant to the handling of the complaint. When a person complains, the inference is that he is content for the professional organisation and the ombudsman to see the relevant documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the information that is made available under the power would have to pass the test of relevancy. That is, it must be relevant to the handling of the case by the Law Society. Who will decide upon the relevancy test and whether papers are relevant? Are there criteria or will the ombudsman decide what is relevant? If so, is that wise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ombudsman will decide, and the matter would have to be relevant in relation to the handling of the complaint. I remember a Bill that gave the Law Society powers to deal with complaints against the profession. Many complaints relate to the slowness of dealing with actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ombudsman's reports would go only to the professional organisation, to the complainer and to the practitioner. The local government ombudsman's powers would be the same as those of the Court of Session to require the production of documents. The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East is tempted to press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the Minister to say that the local government ombudsman possessed the same powers as the Court of Session. But the Minister will know that if one wishes documents to be produced in the Court of Session, one must ask for a commission and diligence—the procedure by which documents are made available—and prepare a specification of documents, setting out in detail precisely which documents one requires. Then, anyone who opposes the production of those documents or believes that the person making the request is not entitled to them, may come and argue the case before a judge. The judge appoints a commissioner, who, if necessary, holds a hearing at which the documents are produced. There are many procedural differences between what the Minister has described in relation to the local government ombudsman and the Court of Session and what is proposed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the procedures are not identical but the powers are the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
In relation to amendment No. 20, the phrase "entitled in law" would give the Law Society or the solicitor powers to prevent papers going to the ombudsman simply by writing "This is confidential" on all papers and correspondence relating to the client. That is not in the interests of the complainer and we think that it would give scope for endless argument and delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of amendments Nos. 20 and 21 is to protect a professional organisation from being open to legal challenge for producing a document to the ombudsman. However, the same effect is achieved by amendment No. 5, which makes it clear that the professional organisation's duty to produce documents is to apply, notwithstanding any duty of confidentiality. Amendment No. 5 has the advantage of avoiding any complicated mechanism for establishing whether the professional organisation is already entitled in law to pass on a document. It also ensures that the ombudsman still has access to all the documents which, for example, the Law Society took into account and which he considers necessary for his investigation. I hope that allays the concerns of the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East about clause 1 and ask him not to press his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the Minister's comments, I want to test the Committee's views about amendments Nos. 20 and 21. I shall press them to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have noted the concerns of the Law Society of Scotland with regard to the granting of absolute privilege to the reports of the ombudsman. I am prepared to accept that it would be sufficient for the ombudsman's reports and any publicity that he gives to failure to comply with his recommendations to be accorded qualified rather than absolute privilege. His reports and publicity could then be challenged if malice could be proved. Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 reflect that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 10 to 14 are intended to ensure that the professional organisation simply has to give notification to the ombudsman and the complainer within three months of receiving the ombudsman's report of the action that it has taken to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
comply with the ombudsman's recommendation. The amendments also require the professional organisation to state expressly if it decides not to comply wholly with a recommendation, and to give any reason for that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society was concerned that the publicity requirement in each case was to be set when the ombudsman's report was made. I understand that there are occasionally cases in which the ombudsman is satisfied with the Law Society's reasons for not complying. In such circumstances, all may agree that publicity would not be appropriate. It could be avoided, however, only by the professional organisation breaching its statutory duty to publicise non-compliance under new subsection (8). Amendment No. 9 and Government amendments Nos. 15 to 19 remove the requirement on the professional organisation to publicise. Instead, at the end of the three-month period after the ombudsman delivers his report, the ombudsman himself can publicise noncompliance, as he considers reasonable. He will, of course, be able to take into account any reasons for non-compliance given by the professional organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society was also concerned that the Bill would allow the ombudsman complete discretion over appropriate publicity. I am happy to undertake that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland would give directions to the ombudsman over appropriate publicity should the ombudsman act unreasonably in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into detail on amendments Nos. 25 to 28 because the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East may wish to speak to them and I want to hear what he has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the Minister some succour because he has responded sensibly to some of the points made to him on Second Reading and by organisations outside the Committee. His proposal to remove absolute privilege is consistent with my amendment No. 25, which reaches the same conclusion, but uses a different form of words. As I have accepted the reasonableness of his amendments, it will not be necessary for me to detain the Committee with any discussion of amendments Nos. 26 and 27 because they were consequential on earlier amendments that I did not move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I conclude, I should like to know why on earth it was ever conceived that the ombudsman should have absolute privilege. Does the local government ombudsman have absolute privilege? Does the parliamentary commissioner have absolute privilege? Absolute privilege is the privilege that is accorded to us in this place and to judges. It is curious that an appointed official should be invested with the privilege of Members of Parliament and judges. Even though the Minister has sensibly decided to move away from that decision, there may have been some
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
rationale behind it. The Committee might be interested to know why absolute privilege was thought to be necessary when the Bill was first drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, it will not be necessary for me to press amendment No. 25 because the Minister has accepted my view, albeit in a different form of words. I shall not press amendments Nos. 26 and 27 because they were consequential on amendments that have not been moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There are negative elements to the granting of absolute privilege in relation to judicial activism. I welcome some of the developments, particularly when a Government have a huge majority and override the concerns of minority groups both within and outwith Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State referred to a challenge being allowed. How is such a challenge made and who hears the challenge of a recommendation made by the ombudsman? As far as I know, a recommendation of his or hers—if we allow of ombudswomen as well as ombudsmen—cannot be challenged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the amendments. Originally, there was a complex formula in subsections (8) and (9) of new section 34A, which has been simplified. If that amendment, which I was informed about by letter, had not been tabled by the Government, I would have moved an amendment to that effect. Similarly, I welcome the change from absolute privilege to qualified privilege. That allays concerns that have been expressed. I welcome the fact that the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East has not pressed amendments Nos. 22 and 23 because the change to qualified privilege has dealt with his concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the permissive powers to the ombudsman in the clause and I am pleased that the request to the Law Society to comply with those has not been watered down. It is right that they should be asked to comply with them rather than respond to them. The amended Bill is much better than the original.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for their contributions. The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow asked whether the ombudsman could be challenged if it was alleged that he had shown malice. That would be extremely unlikely and, obviously, the ombudsman would aim not to be in that position. The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East asked which other commissioners have absolute privilege. The health service ombudsman, the pensions ombudsman and the local government ombudsman have absolute privilege, as do judges and Members of Parliament. Obviously, the ground for challenge will be narrow and we do not think that the risk of that happening is sufficiently substantial to justify a particular requirement.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the full context of the Bill but I should like clarification on one point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am always concerned about retrospective legislation and, in this respect, I have a particular interest. I have had a long-standing dispute with a person in my constituency and, to some extent, the Law Society. It has run for two or three years and I am still in correspondence on it. I seek clarification from the Minister that such a case could be referred back to and dealt with by the ombudsman when the Bill is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions in clause 6 apply to any handling complaint made to the ombudsman on or after the coming into force of the Act. My hon. Friend might like to write to me, and I should be happy to follow up his query. The legislation has to be enacted first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 will apply after the coming into force of the Act, even though the original conduct complaint may have been made to the professional organisation long before. That small element of retrospection will ensure that benefits to legal customers start as soon as possible. When special circumstances exist—for example, when a complaint was made some years ago but not investigated until after the courts ruled on possible negligence—the ombudsman will be able to take those into account in making his report and framing any recommendations. All handling complaints made before the Act comes into force will be treated in accordance with the 1990 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee. I am contributing to the debate only because of part II. Some members of the Committee may have realised that legal services are not part of my remit. However, I was finally persuaded by the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask two questions. We welcome clause 7: indeed, we should like it to be strengthened because we believe so strongly in high standards of conduct for councillors and other local government officials. We welcome the extension of its powers, which means that Scotland will have the same powers as England to investigate such individuals. I am told that the most common reason for investigation in England is that someone has not declared an interest. Such an issue can now be dealt with in Scotland.

Do the Government propose to extend the measure? The joint Convention of Scottish Local Authorities-Scottish Office task force made other recommendations for extensions of the ombudsman's power. Are the Government still considering those recommendations, particularly with regard to recruitment and contracts? Do they think that the new code of conduct on recruitment is adequate and that Accounts Commission has sufficient powers to investigate contracts, or are they considering giving those extra powers to the Commissioner for Local Administration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to answer that question. The task force on local government conduct identified other possible extensions of the commissioner's jurisdiction, including the investigation of maladministration relating to staff appointments and certain aspects of the letting of contracts. Those proposals could be implemented by secondary legislation. The ombudsman took the view—most recently expressed in evidence to the Nolan Committee—that he should have extended powers to cover those matters. We are considering those suggestions, although at present they do not command the support of other key bodies that represent or monitor local government, including COSLA and the Accounts Commission for Scotland. The proposal remains under active consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The clause states that the commissioner can investigate maladministration arising from the actions of any member or officer of an authority. The wording of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975 does not enable the commissioner to investigate maladministration arising from the actions of members of authorities. The new power will apply to all complaints made to the commissioner after the clause is enacted. That proposal is supported by COSLA. I therefore recommend the new power. Related matters are still under consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
