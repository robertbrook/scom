	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Public Expenditure in Scotland</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely grateful for the further opportunity to debate the public expenditure plans for the first three years of the next Government. The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) may scoff but that is what they are: they set out the public expenditure plans for the period that will be in the charge of the next Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the hon. Gentleman's huffing and puffing, there is agreement across the Floor of the Committee between Conservative and Labour Members about the Budget strategy. The Labour party does not want higher public borrowing and it opposes tax increases at a United Kingdom level. We are extremely grateful for Labour's support for the tax cuts that the Chancellor announced in the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party agrees that we must reduce the public sector borrowing requirement and that we should reduce the proportion of Government expenditure to below 40 per cent. of gross domestic product. The Labour party appears to be committed to the current block and formula arrangements for funding Scotland although, of course, it would put them at risk with its tartan tax-raising Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear: the disagreement between us is only about how the existing pot is to be divided up. I exempt from my remarks the hon. Members for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) and for Banff and Buchan (Mr. S almond), whose position is different. They would impose additional taxation and would increase the size of the pot. As for the official Opposition, however, the dispute between us is how the money should be divided up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Monday, we spelt out our priorities. To meet them we had to make reductions in some aspects of spending. We are honest and open about that: we had to make tough choices and select our priorities. Our baseline is falling in real terms. Under a Labour Government, the same baseline would be falling in real terms—a Scottish Parliament, of course, would threaten further that baseline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made education, law and order, health, industry and enterprise our priorities. That means a tight settlement for local government; reducing expenditure on trunk roads; getting councils to rely more on the private finance initiative for capital; and a reduction in housing investment, unless local authorities make progress with the task of stock transfers. Unless the policies that we pioneered so effectively are embraced, there will be less
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
scope to continue the massive expansion of housing investment in Scotland under a Conservative Government—nearly £12 billion has been invested in improving housing and providing vastly new opportunities for people to opt for home ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been made by some elements about the outcome for the housing programme, but that must be put into perspective. My contribution from the block to local authority investment will remain unchanged for the second year running. Last year, outstanding housing debt was £.9 billion or £6,166 for every council house. This year it is £4.1 billion or £6,521 for every council house: an ever-increasing burden that will fall on the rent payer and, ultimately, the taxpayer, unless action is taken to stem the growth of debt. Will the hon. Member for Hamilton tackle that problem, or will he allow it to continue? Of course there are investment needs. We shall provide £540 million—more than half a billion pounds—over the next three years. Taken together with receipts, the total at local authorities, disposal should be a great deal more than £700 million. That will provide a base to attract further investment from the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to read in today's edition of 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> in a report about the Scottish Grand Committee, that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) had not agreed to Shelter's proposals because the party was not committing itself to specific figures on housing for its first Scottish Office budget. The Labour party says that it is concerned about housing, and I believe it expects to be in office in a few months' time—some time after May—but it is absolutely disgraceful that it cannot say what it will do about housing. It is not fit to be the Opposition, never mind in government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>((Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for giving way. Unfortunately, he did not hear my speech at the Scottish Grand Committee on Monday because he did not have the courtesy to stay for the main debate. Is he aware that I quoted Edinburgh council's chair of housing, who is try to set up a local housing company on an Edinburgh estate? She said that because of massive cuts in her housing budget this year she would not be able to pump prime that company. We have made it absolutely clear that, for us, private money represents additional investment rather than a cover for massive cuts as it is with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will study the hon. Gentleman's remarks carefully, as I always do. I must also apologise for the fact that I was unable to hear his speech, but, despite its length, he did not make a single commitment to funding. What did he say to the lady from Edinburgh council about Labour's commitments? Nothing, because the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are taking orders from Islington. They are not in a position to give commitments about housing or anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way forward has been charted by Scottish Homes. More than 18,000 homes have been transferred to alternative landlords. That has created a debt problem, with an increasing burden falling on tenants, and a growing share of our annual grant-in-aid—£45 million this year—is used to service debt. We cannot allow that situation to continue—we need to pay off the debt and to use all the receipts to do so. The new plans for Scottish Homes should, over four years, remove the debt. The second question that I want the hon. Member for Hamilton
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
to answer, therefore, is whether the Opposition will seek to reverse that policy, or do they agree with us that it is right to pay off the debt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the consequences for the development programme of losing the receipts—they are similar to the situation in local government. Neither Scottish Homes nor local government would have any of the money if that lot on the Opposition Benches had their way—they have been against sales and stock transfers from the beginning. That has been possible only because of our pioneering policies. I recognise the difficulties that that will create for the maintenance of a development programme. That is why I provided £43 million from the block for development work by Scottish Homes. That means that over the next three years about £600 million will be available for investment in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for speaking at length on this matter. Reading the statements and comments in the press of some Opposition Members, it appears that people do not realise the extent of the investment in housing or the reasons why we have taken our decisions. We want to hear in concrete terms what Labour Members will do—and we want no more sound bites and no more expressions of opposition to our policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian H. Donohoe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for the Government to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is for the Government. I have announced the expenditure plans for the next Government, and I expect to be in office to implement them. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If Opposition Members think that they will form the next Government, we are entitled to know how they intend to change our plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we examine our record, we can see how we have used resources effectively to get results and reward efficiency. On health, we have secured savings in our hospitals of more than 2 per cent. a year, releasing £18 million from administration in boards and trusts. When the Labour party is asked how it will fund the health service, it claims that it will save money on administration. We have saved £18 million on administration this year and will release a further 33 per cent. over the next two years in board administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State not realise that the figures are wholly bogus? The impact of Government policies since 1987 has been to rob health boards in Scotland of vital resources as they cut things to the bone. Why does the Secretary of State not ask the Minister of State what he was told when he visited the Royal Edinburgh hospital with me over the summer? That hospital is straining to provide for care in the community because the Secretary of State has so chronically underfunded it. If the Secretary of State wants to talk about—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we have the gist of the question from the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister of State would have been able to tell the Royal Edinburgh hospital that the Conservative party is committed to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
increasing health spending in real terms this year and every year throughout the course of the next Parliament. We have made that commitment in the public expenditure plans under discussion this morning. The hon. Member for Hamilton is unable to make such a commitment, although we extracted a commitment from him on Monday in the Grand Committee. We want him to give the same commitment to the health service for the whole of the next Parliament as we currently provide. We will increase expenditure in real terms year after year. The truth of the matter is that the hon. Member for Hamilton and his party cannot make that commitment because they have already promised the money to their friends in local government, which is their priority over the health service. That is the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the claims made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) about policies since 1987, he might reflect that while he has been opposing market testing in the health service, 410 contracts have been left in the health service. He was opposed to those, but they have released an extra £105 million for patient care. The result is that 300,000 more patients were treated last year than were treated 10 years ago. That is our record and those are the facts. The Labour party could never hold a candle to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Waiting lists have been slashed and we have said that the health service will receive £148 million extra next year. When I asked those on the Opposition Front Bench to give a commitment to the health service, they refused to do so. I hope that we will hear a clear commitment from the Labour party this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On law and order, there are more police officers as a result of recruitment and civilianisation. We will have a total of more than 14,700 by the end of next year, which is 16 per cent. more than in 1979. We have better information technology systems to help to clear up crime. We propose a Livescan project, which will allow more fingerprinting of those in custody, linking them to unsolved crimes. The result is that 1995 was the fourth successive year in which recorded crime decreased in Scotland. Crime was down by 4.6 per cent. between 1994 and 1995. The clear-up rate rose by 2 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We plan to build a new prison using PFI. The difference between the Government and the Opposition is that we are prepared to put the resources into the prison system in order to ensure that the punishment fits the crime and that disposals are available to the courts. Opposition Members are not prepared to make that commitment. The English experience has shown that by bringing in the private sector, we can get better prisons that are better run and cost the taxpayer less. Next year, we will give another £20 million to the police and £10 million more to prisons. We are putting our money into law and order. What will the Opposition do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way because the hon. Member for Hamilton does not want me to talk too much—he says that I will run over time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In higher education, unit costs of teaching are down by 30 per cent. since 1980. We have maintained the standard of quality. Public funding is up by 25 per cent. since 1991. Some 40 per cent. of young Scots participate in higher education, thanks to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
opportunities provided by the Government, and we are committing ourselves to £13 million more for higher education next year. Even the Association of University Teachers welcomed that. Would a Labour Government reverse that or would they leave it in place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned crime. I have heard him say, in this Committee and elsewhere, that crime figures in Scotland have been falling year on year. If the crime figures in Scotland really are falling, why is the Secretary of State planning more prisons?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we want people who are guilty of serious crimes to serve their full sentences and because we believe the punishment should fit the crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise have maintained their outputs, as promised, with fewer resources. If Scottish Enterprise can do it, why cannot local government? The result has been a spectacular success in inward investment. Some 20 per cent. of those undergoing training are achieving qualifications. That is why I have made a commitment to give £30 million more to Scottish Enterprise this year and next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, so it is £10 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is £20 million and £10 million. The hon. Gentleman may sneer, but we want to know whether he would maintain that commitment, and he should tell the Committee today so that we know where his priorities lie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are major priorities in big services. Backing success and innovation is our policy, and I shall draw to the Committee's attention a few matters that there was not time to mention on Monday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On tourism, the Scottish tourist board has made good use of the increase provided last year, and we expect that the 1996 season will prove to have been even better than 1995. I have, therefore, agreed to increase its budget by 5 per cent. to £19.3 million for next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The all-party drugs campaign, Scotland Against Drugs, has achieved real momentum and is being well supported by Opposition Members. It is forging a wide range of links with youth culture, communities and the media, and I plan to double its funding to £2 million and to put an extra £50,000 into the successful challenge fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the University of the Highlands and Islands, we are backing the strong commitment to this across the highlands, and I shall be providing an extra £2.4 million for that project in further education plans for next year, as well as an extra £800,000 in the budget of Highlands and Islands Enterprise. That means that, taken overall, the commitment between now and the year 2000 to the University of the Highlands and Islands is £16 million. I hope that the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) will recognise that we have been as good as our word in supporting that project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we have published today the task force's report, "Improving Achievements in Scottish Schools", copies of which are available in Committee, together with the Government's response. The report recommends, among other valuable proposals, early intervention schemes to improve basic literacy and numeracy skills,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
supported by grant. I shall make £9 million available over the next three years to supplement council expenditure in that vital area of maintaining standards and investing in the basics in our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are out priorities; the Opposition's priority is local government. That is because the Labour party controls local government in Scotland. But the Opposition cannot have substantial real increases in health and local government without making huge cuts elsewhere. The serious point is that local government extravagance is not sustainable within the block; the only way in which it could be sustained would be by putting up taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When representatives of the Labour-dominated Convention of Scottish Local Authorities came to see me about the Budget, at the beginning of the meeting, they asked for an extra £480 million. At the end of the meeting, they reduced that figure to £180 million—with hindsight, I wish that we had had two meetings because that was a huge reduction. We gave it £132 million but that only encouraged it and it now says that it needs £350 million. It is a crazy numbers game with no foundation in accounting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the hon. Member for Hamilton to tell us how much he would give to local government next year. Of course, the way things are going, he may not be Secretary of State for Scotland, but, if there is a Labour victory at the election, the first thing that person will be asked by the permanent secretary is, "Secretary of State, do you wish to alter the priorities that have been set, because you have to do it now, in June? What are your priorities?" If the hon. Gentleman seeks that office, he should have a clue about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Member for Hamilton agree with Labour-dominated COSLA, and if so will he tell us from where the extra £218 million will come? Will it be funded by a 4.5 per cent. real cut in the national health service? Or will it be funded by a complete abandonment of the roads and transport programme? We are entitled to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will no doubt set out Labour's priorities, and if I have got it wrong I should like to know his alternative expenditure programme within the spending block. The truth is that the Labour party is paralysed. It is unable to decide policies. It wants to inflict a tax-raising Parliament on the Scottish people. The tartan tax and the proceeds from returning the business rate to local authorities—the trade tax—would cripple the Scots, and that is where part of the money would come from to meet some of the Labour party's aspirations. An uncapped council tax would spiral out of control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way. I should first like to thank him for his announcement about the University of Highlands and Islands, which is appreciated by all of us in the region who campaigned for it for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Secretary of State finishes talking about the overall budget, will he comment on the cutbacks being made to the road trunk programme, in particular what the implications of that are for the Keith and Fochabers bypasses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will be aware that neither of those projects are in the programme. I very much regret the reductions in the trunk road programme that I have had to make in order to find money for local government.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
I am hopeful that our competitive tendering policy in local government, which will come back into play later this year, will help to release resources. I want to progress with the trunk road programme but I cannot do so.

I know of the importance that the hon. Lady attaches to those bypasses, but the truth of the matter is that I am funding four major programmes, including the A75. I see that my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Munro) is twitching. The A75—the Glen road—is in the programme, but I cannot give the hon. Lady the commitment that she wants. As for Fochabers, it is not at the stage where it would be in the three-year programme. I certainly attach some priority to it. If the hon. Lady can help to ensure that I am here after the election, I will do my best to help her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was explaining how the Opposition policy of uncapping council taxes would spiral out of control, and the consequences that would have for jobs and investment. I must tell the hon. Member for Hamilton that his problem is not just one of trying to identify priorities within the overall budget. His commitment to a tax-raising Parliament means that it would be impossible to maintain the present 30 per cent. favourable block and formula arrangements that amount to many billions of pounds of extra expenditure in Scotland. No sane and informed person could believe that our funding arrangements would remain unchanged, with so much revenue being generated in Scotland and with a devolved Parliament disrupting the constitutional balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The serious point is that our vital services—hospitals, schools, police and so on—are at stake as well as our entire prosperity. I challenge the hon. Member for Hamilton: if there is a future Labour Government, can he guarantee that they would maintain the block and formula arrangements? If a Scottish Parliament meant that such arrangements would no longer be sustained, would he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
abandon the whole daft project? We need that commitment today, because it goes to the heart of public expenditure in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present disastrous scheme would lead to our paying more tax and receiving less support for our public services. There is only one logical consequence of the hon. Gentleman's position—rocking taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State say why the Government imposed a £3.5 billion extra tax burden on Scotland over the past three years?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember when Opposition Members used to say that they wanted to increase public expenditure. Many people in Scotland cling to that view. I do not share it, but it is a respectable view when honestly expressed. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is a good exponent of that line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is honest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. But Opposition Members are all new Labour—Scottish Labour is now taking its orders from Islington; gagging orders, in most cases. The Labour party's deafening silence on public expenditure is a betrayal of the Scottish people. The hon. Member for Hamilton degenerates into farce in his stock response to pertinent enquiries about his party's public expenditure plans. "I haven't seen the books" is his limp defence. No doubt we shall hear the same defence this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton saw the accounts for the Scottish Office last March, along with every other Scottish Member of Parliament. I can give them to him now to refresh his memory. There are more copies of the accounts on the Table, if he has not had time to read them.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
There is nothing secret about the allocation of the Scottish block. It is entirely in the public domain. The hon. Gentleman knows exactly what the accounts are; he has had nine months to study them. Yet when he received an update of them on Monday, he complained that it was too lengthy. The truth is that he does not want to know about them, but Scotland wants to know the Labour party's plans for public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 30 years ago, the Labour party fought the general election with a programme that was memorably denounced as "a menu without prices". By 1979, we knew the price. It took us years to recover from that, and it must not happen again. The Opposition have no excuse for concealing their spending priorities. To imagine that they can keep them under wraps until after a general election is to display gross arrogance towards the Scottish people. The hon. Member for Hamilton and his party owe Scotland an explanation. Let us her it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the air of panic in the Secretary of State's demeanour, I though at first of objecting to his breaching our agreement that the Scottish Grand Committee should start with a 20-minute opening speech, which he has broken by a full 10 minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about interventions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The agreement was to include interventions—that is, if the parrot who masquerades as a Minister of the Crown could say anything intelligent; but on this occasion, I decided to be indulgent. This is, after all, the last public expenditure statement that he will make and we should perhaps be generous to the wee man as he makes his swan-song.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be difficult for anyone objectively to believe that the Secretary of State should make a statement defending such a programme. The Government may be rehearsing for their role as the Opposition, which they will take on within the next six months, but we do not know whether the right hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) will be the Member for Kensington and Chelsea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Government to come here with a series of plans and then simply to batter the Opposition with them. Today, the Government will defend on the Floor of the House a position on which they have torn themselves apart. It is interesting to note that the Secretary of State will be a player in that great battle this afternoon. The Government's credibility is as limited in Committee as in the Chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reflected for a moment as the Secretary of State spoke that his views, and those of the hon. Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for North Tayside (Mr. Walker), are very close to the views of the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman). I wondered how they reacted yesterday when the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has that to do with the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is about the Government's credibility, and how believable their promises and commitments are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
The hon. Member for Harlow said yesterday on London news Radio that
	<br><q><p>"People like Teresa Gorman have turned the Back-Benchers of the Conservative party into a institute for the politically insane."</p></q>
He concluded by saying the party activists
	<br><q><p>"don't want the party in the country to be held to ransom by a small band of swivel-eyed anoraks."</p></q>
So much for the party of government—the party that is putting forward its views today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have been happy to hear from the right hon. Gentleman, who is still temporarily the Secretary of State for Scotland, about some of the promises and commitments that he will make. Will he support increasing VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent. after the election? He was in favour of it last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three tests for the Secretary of State. Does he favour increasing VAT on fuel, a tax that bears more heavily on the Scottish people than on anyone else? Will he introduce vouchers for primary and secondary education? Will there be more privatisation in the national health service, such as that seen in the Stonehaven hospital project? Those are three tests for the Secretary of State, in the unlikely event that the Conservatives are re-elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The public expenditure plans that we are debating this morning are based on the taxation proposals of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I heard nothing in the Budget about changes in VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gently remind the hon. Gentleman that he is in some difficulty on that subject. Apart from the tartan tax, the only commitment that I have known the Labour party to make on tax—to limit VAT to 5 per cent.—was first proposed by the Scottish National party and was immediately denounced as ridiculous and unworkable by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the other two challenges? We have been told first about the Chancellor—the Secretary of State does not agree with him on anything—but we are told nothing about vouchers for primary and secondary education and nothing was said against privatisation in the national health service of the sort that we have already seen in Scotland. People will draw their own conclusions on the secret agenda of the Conservative party. The Labour party will be honest on public expenditure. When we have costed our commitments, we shall make promises and we shall deliver—unlike the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may wave the blue book of Scottish Office accounts, but where in that book is there mention of the cool £500,000 for St. Mary's school in Dunblane—a tiny, opted-out school in a small town which already has two primary schools? From where is that money being dreamt up? The Secretary of State hands the book to people whom we are not allowed to mention and says, "Find it". Indeed, the money can be found for pet projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks where in the book the money is mentioned.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must rise to the occasion; he is supposed to be the shadow Secretary of State. We have set out the public expenditure plans for the next three years and we have asked the hon. Gentleman what his priorities are. He has criticised my priorities and he is not prepared to make a commitment on health—will he tell the Committee where his priorities lie? I can assure him that there is provision in the budget for the money for St.Mary's school. He knows that it is set out in the book, so he should stop wriggling and start telling the Committee what his priorities are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a certain degree of excitement. I have discounted the rumours about Kensington and Chelsea; I did not think that they were that terrible, but I am generous. When the Secretary of State talks about GM schools, however, which are a new concept for Scotland, perhaps he really is practising for Kensington and Chelsea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us turn to the burning question: where is the money to come from? The people of Scotland know that this bunch are wasters. They waste public money on a scale that has not been seen for generations. When they ask where the money is coming from, the people of Scotland want to ask: what about £ 1 billion wasted on the poll tax experiment in Scotland, which originated in the Secretary of State's brain? What about the hundreds of millions of pounds squandered on gerrymandering local government in Scotland? What about the £30 million poured into a private hospital in Clydebank? What about the £9 million spent each year on the assisted places scheme for the few rather than the many?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) should know that if he wants to ask the hon. Gentleman to give way, he should get on his feet and not shout from a sitting position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hamilton for giving way and I apologise to you, Mr. Hogg. The hon. Gentleman talks about waste, but how much will it cost to create a Scottish Assembly? Will that money come from the Scottish block allocation, or from another source?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The funds to build a Scottish Parliament, which will make Government much more accountable and efficient, will of course come from the existing Scottish Office allocation. [Hon. Members: "Where from?"] I know that Conservative members of the Committee are overexcited. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Secretary of State, having asked his officials to find where the £500,000 came from for St. Mary's school in Dunblane, throws the blue book over to me as if it were evidence. He has underlined the figure of £24 million that is allocated for schools and current expenditure. That means that the £500,000 that is being given to a tiny school in a town that already has two primary schools is coming from the budget for schools£it is being taken from other schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
Let me conclude the list of Government waste, so that people can put the Secretary of State's claims into context. The opt-out schools campaign, which is currently being masterminded—that is a loose description—by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), has been a costly failure, given that it has led to only two schools in Scotland opting out of a high-quality local government system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the £ 1 billion that the Government have wasted on privatising the rail network? What about the billions and billions of pounds, including the North sea oil revenue, squandered on paying for unemployment through the three slumps that the Government have created over the past 17 years? The Government are the real tartan wasters; they waste public money on a spectacular scale, leaving us with nothing. The Secretary of State said that we must examine the Scottish Office accounts; we must then draw conclusions from them for the next Government. Perhaps we should not just take my words about that—they might be seen as somewhat partisan. What about the editorial in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> yesterday? It said:
	<br><q><p>"Here is the full panoply of prestidigitation—"</p></q>
—an interesting word, even for 	<i>The Scotsman</i>—
	<br><q><p>" 'increases' elsewhere revealed to be cuts, totals conjured which are mysteriously more than the sum of their constituent parts, money given loudly and proudly with one hand and removed silently with the other."</p></q>
That is what outside, objective observers say about the Government's statistical accounting forecast for the coming year. Why should we believe the Government's figures when we have never been able to trust them in the past?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition will be honest with the electorate. We shall not go into an election saying that we shall give tax cuts "year on year" and then put up taxes by the equivalent of 7p in the pound. We will not use the phraseology used in that tax lie—year on year—about increases in the national health service unless we are confident that the legacy of the Government's financial chaos will allow such a commitment."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are offering sweeteners, to use the expression that 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> used last Sunday, in a report on a leaked, detailed briefing that it got from someone inside the Scottish Office: it is a case of sweeteners before the election, bitter pain afterwards if they win, of scorched earth policies that involve asset stripping the state for pre-election shop windows and fiscal misery afterwards. The sweeteners are paid for by revenue streams that the Government do not identify; the increase in prescription charges to £5.65, for example, was slipped through during the Budget process. We see revenue streams punishing people in ill health, promises based on the sale of national assets such as the Forestry Commission, capital programmes built—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

capital programmes identified in "Serving Scotland's Needs", the document before the Committee, are built on fragile assumptions based on dishonest PFI projects—not one of those contracts has even been signed. The new Edinburgh royal infirmary was scheduled to open this year, but is still stuck in the red tape and bureaucracy of the Government's PFI projects. We learn from the Government's statement that the remaining motorway section of the M8 will be built not as a PFI project, but as a privately financed and owned project. The prospect of tolls on the M8 seems no; longer just a distant gleam in the eye of the Secretary of State. This Scottish budget is based on falsehoods—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is no capital programme outside the Government's version of the PFI, which has yet to provide a single bed in Scotland. At the same time as he claims that he is giving more money to the health service, the Secretary of State is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
taking money away by prescription charges. Will he admit that, after inflation has been taken into account, the extra money to the health service means a 1.5 per cent. increase to the national health service budget in Scotland? That is a mere £62 million, compared with the £170 million that is being wasted in the health service on bureaucratic red tape and the internal market and the £30 million that the was wasted on one privatised hospital in Clydebank.

The Secretary of State has the cheek to ask if we will match the Government's commitment. Of course, we will match it. I can tell the right hon.

We shall go much further in tackling NHS bureaucracy because we shall get rid of the internal market which created it in the first place. We shall be not just tough on red tape but tough on the causes of red tape in the national health service.

While speaking about the national health service, I must tell the Committee that another death from the E. coli tragedy has been announced. An 11th person has now died as a consequence of contracting E.coli, which focuses our attention on how much we owe the health service and the hospitals and health institutions in Lanarkshire, in particular. We must be strong about getting to the root of how the crisis started and how it was managed. In the light of that new tragic information, I must tell the Secretary of State that I am still not satisfied with the answers that he give on Monday or about ministerial responsibility for the crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State intends to impose cuts on local government in this spending round. If the facilities of public health depends and the effectiveness of local authorities is reduced because of the imposition of new responsibilities on local government, the added burdens that he will expect them to carry from reduced funds, and the way in which the reorganisation has not been funded he will face a heavy responsibility. We already know that local government is considering those options. It would be deeply regrettable were that to happen.

There has been a cover-up, and the information has been hidden with mirrors. The Scottish Office document is a prospectus for the general election, not one for any realistic Government of the future. We know what the Government promised before the last election, and we saw what they delivered. So no one in his right mind would accept their figures as a basis for a serious Government to make promises—such a Government will be elected next year.

I welcome what the Secretary of State says about the role of Scottish Enterprise and the fact that £10 million—only £10 million—will be given back to it this year. Let us not kid ourselves about the £20 million coming next year. Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch), who has responsibility for industry, will tell us whether all that money will come from secret revenue streams? Will the Government have to sell capital assets to raise the £10 million which will be returned to Scottish Enterprise from the amount stolen last year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Enterprise announced recently that it would have to scrap all inward investment projects for the next two years unless last year's cut of £37 million was reinstated in full. As it will receive only £10 million of that £37 million, can we assume that inward investment projects are on hold?

My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) made a brilliant contribution on local government at Monday's sitting of the Scottish Grand Committee which the Secretary of State discourteously missed. He highlighted and underlined the crisis that local government will face as a direct consequence of the Government's actions this year. In reality, a Government who cannot even pay their own bills due to local government are not likely to be a Government who can be trusted to provide the services that are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we have heard from the Government this morning is a procession of denigration of what local government does. We are told that we favour local government more than the health service, but community care—an aspect of local government—will be affected by the Government's proposals, to take credit for developing the national health service. They cannot have it every way.

Scotland is paying dearly for the Government's economic failure. Despite all the talk of tax cuts that we heard this morning, the average Scottish family will have paid an extra £2,120 in tax by the time of the next election. Do not ask the Government for honesty about

that, but, last week there was a rare moment of honesty from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who admitted that people are paying more tax in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish people has been lied to by the Government, who have promised lower taxes and higher spending, but they have produced higher taxes and lower spending. People in Scotland, as elsewhere, are sick and tired of the Conservative party's divided, weak leadership. The Government's time is almost up; the verdict of the Scottish people is nigh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The people want answers and the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) has given none.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past week he has created two doctrines—the Robertson doctrines. The first, which we have heard today, is "Never answer a question. Draw a line under everything that has been discussed before; we don't need to answer it now." The second is the one he propounded to the House last week as an apologia for the failure of the vote on the firearms legislation: "Never have a vote if you think you'll lose." That was picked up by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) and my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) who sat, as I did, listening in astonishment to the new Labour party doctrine: it was never going to vote because it was always going to lose. No doubt that doctrine will continue until the last date when we can call a general election.

To be serious, I should like to say how desperately sad I am that there has been another tragic death from the food poisoning outbreak in central Scotland. The type of inquiry that will take place following the tragedy is covered in the expenditure of the Government. I say to the hon. Member for Hamilton that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been absolutely correct in adopting a twin-track approach of a medical inquiry, by Dr. Pennington and his team, and a fatal accident inquiry under the Lord Advocate and the sheriff principal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lockerbie disaster could not have been a more serious or tragic disaster for Scotland. It resulted in the deaths of 270 people in my constituency in one night. After it, we followed the same process: there was a Board of Trade inquiry into the aircraft accident and a fatal accident inquiry—under the sheriff principal, with evidence led by the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General—covering the large number of deaths in the greatest of detail. There were weeks of inquiry and pages of relevant discussion were reported. In his conclusions, the sheriff principal made strong recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand how any other form of inquiry—except a public inquiry, where there might be a judge instead of a sheriff principal—could equal the Lockerbie inquiry in detail. Even that would only be a marginal detail because the same legal requirements for witnesses obtain to both. My right hon. Friend is right, therefore, to proceed in the way that he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

and all officials in the Scottish Office and the Treasury to try to reduce the mumbo-jumbo of local government finance. It is up to us to explain to people the transparency of local government finance. Of example, there is GSE, which is Government-supported expenditure; GAE, which is grant-aided expenditure; and AEF, which is aggregate external finance. What about district equalisation schemes; mismatch; spending wishes; capping; notional budget; and relevant expenditure? All that makes it almost impossible for the man in the street to understand exactly what is going on. It brings to mind the Irish expression that the man who is not mystified is simply not well informed.</p>
	<p>It is important to have simplification because, in spring, councils send out a document with their council tax demands, which is sometimes a little economical with the truth. Anything can be proved by statistics. Almost inevitably, the councils prove that they are under funded, receive less money from the Government and that it is all the Government's fault. That is simply not fair. I want transparency so that people can see whether the council is overspending by increasing its budget unnecessarily or whether the Government are reducing the block grant? Almost every local council has steadily increased its expenditure year on year, which results in higher council taxes and criticisms of the Government that are unjustified. We simply have to introduce a sense of good housekeeping and prudent expenditure into local government.</p>
	<p>I welcome the comments of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, especially those about health. He was right: we have seen the health service—and real expenditure—improve year on year. How often do we receive criticism of the health service in our constituency mail? Of course the media say that there is insufficient expenditure on the health service, but, at the local level, people say, "My goodness, how well I have been treated. What a short time I had to wait for my major operation. I am going to get an operation that five years ago I thought would never be possible". There have been tremendous improvements in the quality of the health service, I do not believe that anyone can say a word against the quality of our general practitioners' service. It is first-class service, and in many cases general practitioners operate from fine, new health centres.</p>
	<p>I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State provided extra money for education. I am worried about the physical quality of school buildings. More money has simply go to go into education—and into the police and fire services.</p>
	<p>I am glad that my right hon. Friend said that a new section of the A75 will be built. I hope that it will involve the glen just west of Dumfries, which is in the constituency of right hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang). That road is still an important lifeline between Northern Ireland and Europe, and we must continue to improve it.</p>

M74 will be continued. Anyone who regularly drives on that road, as I do, knows that there was an unbelievable improvement when it was upgraded from a dual carriageway to a motorway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The efforts of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to help small businesses through the business rate have been underestimated. That help is crucial. We have not heard a squeak from the Opposition about what they will do about the business rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 2.16 per cent. increase comes during a period of low inflation. Local councils should save some expenditure through increased efficiency. We must make more progress to streamline local authorities which amalgamated last April. I know that they have had a difficult year. Heaven knows, everyone agrees that such a major reorganisation—in my constituency, five councils were merged into one—takes time, but the process is under way, and we expect to see many benefits in years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know why local councillors, who know that they will receive a 2.16 per cent. increase, have tried to turn that into a 4 per cent. cut. They set up a roadshow that toured round Dumfries and Galloway. I note with interest the fact that three prospective parliamentary candidates—all for the opposition parties—took part in that roadshow, which hammered the Government with requests for more money for local government. That is not the way to go. Those people should sit down, put their heads together and say, "How can I save additional expenditure through administration, streamlining and general efficiency?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume from the speech of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that capping levels will continue at the same rate. When he winds up, would the Under-Secretary of State tell me a little more about the formula for rural areas? Is he satisfied that rural areas, which are traditionally low spenders compared with many authorities in the central belt, receive a fair proportion of the available grant? I believe that it is essential that they do. I do not like to hear talk of a 12 per cent. increase in council tax and I hope that there is some way to meet the requests and find a common denominator that will keep the increase in council tax a good deal nearer to the rise in inflation which, as I said earlier, is very low indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the situation is good. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has set out our position and we have gone a long way towards meeting COSLA's outrageous original request. From what my right hon. Friend said, we very nearly came to an agreement with a difference of about £100 million, which is a every small proportion of the overall budget of the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton has not really told us that what he will do about the Scottish Office budget in the unlikely event that he happens to be in power this summer. Time and again, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has requested that the hon. Member for Hamilton tell us that what he will do with expenditure, where his priorities lie and what he will do about x, y and z. Answer comes there none. That is an incredible attitude from a party that pretends to come into power in the summer and to introduce expensive measures such as a Scottish Parliament, which will cost another £75 million, and the tartan tax, which the hon. Gentleman is quite happy to impose. The Labour party lives in a vacuum, not in the real world at all— [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member

One issue to which I take exception is the Secretary of State's fondness for the media and music in everything that he does. The Stone of Destiny is an example. It was a nice, modest gesture to come over the border with a piper and a few Army personnel, but it is quite another issue when he attacks us on public expenditure. That Stone of Destiny jamboree in Edinburgh was a waste of public money. I did not hear the Secretary of State complaining about that—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The right hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) has had his say. If the Secretary of State is going to throw stones about public expenditure, he should consider the public expenditure involved in the Stone of Destiny celebrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another ceremony to open a road to bypass Newton Mearns to get into the city of Glasgow, the Secretary of State was on an Albion truck to break the ribbon. The people in Corkerhill, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) were portrayed as cranks because they opposed the bypass. I only wish that more people would get involved in the opposition to such bypasses. To have no proper public transport system and to concentrate on roads alone means pampering on section of the community. The people in Corkerhill have a right to complain that car owners are able to get into the city of Glasgow faster, while people who are poor and have no money must wait and wait for transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the west of Scotland, we are proud of the fact that we have a green belt second to none. When we talk to English Members about being able to get out of cities such as mine into the countryside in a matter of minutes, they are quite envious. The Government's roads policy will lead the loss of our green belt. Where once there were three farms in my constituency, there are now houses, which, in one way, I welcome because it brings a greater population into the city, but it also means that, from my constituency in north Glasgow to Lennoxtown, there is an unbroken line of houses. That will put more pressure on our green belt. I say to my hon. Friends from Ayrshire that, with the new bypass, furniture vans will be moving into Ayrshire. There is already land speculation in villages that were considered to be too far away from Glasgow, but now housebuilders are beginning to build in the beautiful parts of our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have transport for all, not just transport for car owners. The Government's policy is having an impact on the city of Glasgow because people who are prepared to represent us in the law courts and who work as social workers and city officials—those who do all the professional work—are not prepared to stay the night in the city of Glasgow and they leave at 5 o'clock. In the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
city of Glasgow, we have what are known as brownfield sites. People should be encouraged to live in those areas to ease pressure on the green belt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, we have had to cope with the planning blight and demolition for the Steppes bypass and a bypass that leads into Bishopbriggs. Now those who have benefited from the bypasses are arguing about where new roads should be built because new roads require even more roads. In Port Dundas, a whole community has disappeared from the face of the earth. The communities in Anderston, where I was brought up, and in Kinning Park, on the other side of the river, have disappeared because of motorways—whole communities that could boast 15,000 or 16,000 adults. If a village in one part of the highlands with 300 or 400 people disappeared from the face of the earth, there would be complaints and campaigns in the House, yet that is what has happened int he city and it is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a debt burden for houses that no longer exist. Because of bad behaviour—this week, a Select Committee has been discussing antisocial behaviour—and because of the crimes of drug-pushers, streets in our city have been demolished. The streets no longer exist, but those who pay rent in the city of Glasgow have to take on that debt burden. I ask the Secretary of State—and I shall say the same to my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) when he becomes Secretary of State—to give the local authorities a chance by taking away that debt funding and giving them an opportunity to build new houses. When I was a councillor, I advocated that certain houses should be sold to the sitting tenants, so the sale of council houses is nothing new to me. But now owner-occupiers are applying pressure and saying, "Get my son and daughter a house", and I reply, "How can I get your son and daughter a house, when you have bought your local authority house?".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is a great one for raising people's hopes and then letting them down. He introduced a scheme whereby tenants in Scottish Homes were promised £10,000 to become owner-occupiers. People in my constituency have taken up that offer. Their lawyers have been ready to exchange contracts only to be told that the packets of £10,000 are in a quota system and that they will not get their quota this month or this year. They were told to wait in the queue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's press releases said that people would get £10,000 to buy their houses, but he did not say that they would be disappointed at the last minute. He also told people with a stock transfer to get their community-based housing association and poor-value co-ops up and running so that they could have a say in their own affairs. Yet housing associations such as Milnbank, Reidvale and Springburn and Possil park, which are full of dedicated men and women who have done great work in the rehabilitation of tenements and in new build, are worried by Scottish Office statements on cutbacks to public expenditure. The Secretary of State should not ask people to get involved in housing, which requires them to spend every night going to meetings in order to have a say in the running of their own affairs and to do good by their neighbours if his decisions are going to let them down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for social work, I know what it is to see my relatives as carers in the community. Everyone in the Room would agree that carers are the greatest people int he world. They deserve a medal. The work "carer" rolls off the tongue, but a carer is usually an 80-year-old woman looking after

her elderly husband suffering from Alzheimer's who is like a child. She will not part with that husband to whom she has been married for 60 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those carers need back up from the social work department. If the Minister loves the health service as much as I do, he should not put pressure on it by denying the social work department the moneys it needs to back up carers. If carers lose all hope, it places pressure on the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State told us that people in the community would get a say in running trust hospitals. In my constituency, Stobhill hospital does not have anyone from the city of Glasgow on the trust board.

My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) represents people who work long and hard for the health service. They and my constituents in Springburn fought to save Stobhill hospital. The Minister is aware of ny campaign but I could only be as good as those I represent. The people of Springburn turned out in their thousands to save Stobhill. The fact that not one of them got a place as a lay person on the hospital trust board was a slap in the face. The Minister must be careful. The trusts are not there for him to appoint his placement and placewomen to look after the interests of the Tory party. It is the interests of the community that he should be looking after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I found one today. As the Secretary of State was speaking, my eye caught that magnificent painting, which contributes to the atmosphere here, of Alfred inciting the Saxons to repel the Danes. I realised that the Saxon hordes bear a passing resemblance to the Scottish Conservative party. The painting could be entitled, "Forsyth inciting the Tories to repel the Grand Committee". The longer I look, the more I can see in it: I see the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie), for example; a Saxon at the front is trying to lick Alfred's boots, and there are a number of candidates for that among Scottish Conservative Members. In his spending statement, the Secretary of State has certainly succeeded in inciting the Committee and repelling the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Behind all the bluff and bluster, all the good news announcements, all the front-line services that will be protected, the stark reality is shown in the figures—an £800 million decline in real terms in Scottish public spending over three years. Even if one allows for the commutations, the write-offs and the loan books, the figure is no less than £660 million in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A withdrawal of public funding on that scale over three years is bound to have a significant effect on employment and output in Scotland. When the Secretary of State walked into new St. Andrew house, the Scottish unemployment rate was marginally less than the United
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Kingdom average. One of the most popular refrains from Tory members of the Committee was, "For the first time in a generation, Scottish unemployment is now lower than the United Kingdom average." After 18 months under the current Secretary of State, however, the unemployment rate in Scotland is now 7.8 per cent., compared with the United Kingdom average of 7.2 per cent. I do not blame the Secretary of State alone for that deterioration; some of the blame must attach to his predecessor. An analysis of Scottish employment trends during the past 18 months, however, shows that one of the most significant factors has been local government reorganisation and its inevitable consequence—chaos in the funding for vital projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The jobs that have been lost are not just those of the bureaucrats and pen pushers, who do not do anything useful, as Ministers say; many of them belonged to small private contractors, whose businesses relied heavily on local government being able to fund a steady stream of contracts. Hon. Members can visit any constituency in Scotland and find that people have been laid off during the past 18 months because of the chaos in local government contracts and funding that is the result of local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may shake his head and say, "There must be another explanation"; if there is, the Under-Secretary of State can tell us when he is winding up why, in 16 of the past 18 months, the rate of unemployment in Scotland has been higher than the United Kingdom average.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is the worst relative figure for Scotland since August 1991. If the situation was otherwise, the Secretary of State's entire speech would be a boast about how well Scotland is doing compared with the rest of the United Kingdom. During his term of office, Scotland's relative position has deteriorated; there is no gainsaying the figures.

If the effect over the past few months of local government reorganisation has been that contracts have dried up, what will be the effect over the next three years of the withdrawal of £800 million or more?

Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland brings me to my second argument. I tell the Secretary of State that it is possible to reduce reported public spending in Scotland, as calculated by the Treasury, without any impact on primary services in Scotland. I claim an authority for that—the financial wizard of the Scottish Office, the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), who said in 	<i>The Herald</i> on 5 March 1996:
	<br><q><p>"Commutation is a technical exercise. It will involve no net addition to public spending and no increase in funds available to water authorities."</p></q>
He was referring to the 40 per cent. write-off of the debt to the water authorities. However, that commutation of debt has an effect on reported public spending—not on real public spending, because the loan requirements are adjusted to take account of the reduced debt. The Minister shakes his head, but I am quoting him. It is a technical exercise. All he has to do is look at the tables in the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shows a singular lack of knowledge of those matters. He should be aware that not only was the debt commuted, but the external financing limit—the EFL—was reduced accordingly, such that there was not benefit. That therefore reflected the public expenditure figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman listens for a moment, he will discover that that is exactly my point. It was a technical exercise; there was no real increase in spending because the EFL was reduced in line with the 40 per cent. reduction. If the Minister Under-Secretary of State, who will reply to the debate, cares to look at the figures, he will see a £47 million decrease in reported public spending in Scotland as a result of the commutation. The Treasury counts EFLs, borrowing consents, as part of public spending. That is a long-term
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
convention—;a £47 million reduction in public spending through what the Minister of State himself accepts is a purely technical exercise. If one can reduce public spending in the reported figures by £47 million through commuting the debt by 40 per cent., it follows that one could reduce it by more than £100 million through commuting the debt by 100 per cent.—exactly what was done for the English water authorities when they were sent into the private sector several years ago. There was no question of a 40 per cent. write-off of debt for them—there was a 100 per cent. write-off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters are important. The right hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) described the public spending figures as mumbo-jumbo; that description is correct, because of the Treasury convention. According to its figures, if a local authority agrees a PFI—the mechanism that will ride to the rescue of the Secretary of State, although, as the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) reminded us, few, if any, PFI projects have been agreed—which will have huge financial implications over the medium term for that authority, since many of the best estimates are that PFI funding will be more expensive than traditional public sector financing, that will have no effect on public spending. If, on the other hand, a water authority increases it spending by raising water charges, that is counted as additional public spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Government Front bench look mystified—but that is the reality of the how Treasury accounting works in the Scottish Office. If the Secretary of State wants to claim as a virility symbol a reduction in public spending, why does he not engage in a little statistical manipulation instead of cutting real services and real jobs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of those spending cuts, especially in the housing budget, will be a real decrease in employment. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) spoke about the burden of capital debt on councils, especially on their housing budgets. Some of that debt is historical because the houses have disappeared, but the burden now falls on an ever-reducing number of houses because of sales to the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary attacked Scottish local authorities on Monday for their irresponsibility in allowing capital debt on housing continually to increase. The capital debt is insupportable—for Glasgow and for many other councils in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman repeat to the Committee that the housing debt is insupportable? Is that what he means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the housing debt is insupportable. As the hon. Member for Springburn said, 60p of every pound paid in rent in Scotland goes to servicing capital debt instead of improving houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State should do for housing what the Government did for the privatised water authorities—to commute the debt instead of reducing expenditure on housing. Reductions in housing expenditure will have a huge impact in employment in Scotland. Shelter estimates that 11,000 jobs will go. That translates into 4,000 houses not being built if housing expenditure is sustained at its present low level, or 72,000 houses not being improved.

I advise the Secretary of State to take a close look at the Shelter documents distributed to members of the Committee this morning. We heard on Monday that housing expenditure is much higher in Scotland than south of the border. The Shelter document looks not only at public council housing, but at the whole range of housing provision. For example, it points out that 12 per cent. of tenants in Scotland—compared to England and Scotland together—are on housing benefit but that Scottish spending on housing benefit was only 9 per cent. of combined Scottish and English spending. With 8 per cent. of homeowners, Scotland's spending on income support for mortgage interest is only 3 per cent. of the total; and spending on MIRAS—mortgage interest relief at source—is only 7 per cent. of the total. Shelter cites Government sources and concludes that expenditure paid from the public purse for private and public housing is comparable north and south of the borde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the House of Commons Library to examine public spending on housing, particularly spending per housing revenue account house—not per head, but per house. I shall make the Library's research available to the Committee. Its figures are dramatically different and tell the real story of under-investment in Scottish housing. It found that total expenditure per housing revenue account house is 18 per cent. less in Scotland than south of the border. If one takes account of what was said by the hon. Member for Springburn, the figure rises to 37 per cent. less per house. That is the reality of the under-investment in Scottish housing—a reality that will cost many thousands of jobs in Scotland.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A television series in the 1970s was called the "Six Million Dollar Man". The Secretary of State and I are contemporaries; perhaps he remembers it—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Springburn — am not sure whether he is my contemporary—also remembers the series. After today's announcement, the Secretary of State for Scotland will be known as the "Eight Hundred Million Pound Man"ߞsomeone who, in the Scottish public spending estimates, proposed a cut of £800 million over three years and then paraded it as an enormous triumph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are a disaster for employment; a disaster for services; and a disaster for people in inadequate housing conditions in Scotland. The Secretary of State should be ashamed of those figures. He should not be traipsing round Scotland boasting about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall return to some of the hon. Gentlemen's other points in a moment, but, first, I want to underline what my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries said. We heard the most astonishing speech from the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
for Hamilton, who has just returned to the Committee. I make no criticism about his leaving the Room for a moment or two. So astonishing was the hon. Gentleman's speech that the new centralising guru of Scottish Labour, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish)—who, we are led to believe, is in total charge of all publicity because of the collective mess made by Opposition Members on Front Bench—came in, read out his Islington soundbite and left, never to be to seen again. No doubt, he is still reporting on the shambles of the speech of the hon. Member for Hamilton to some little tea boy from Islington in the Leader of the Opposition's office, where the real power lies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>We could not reasonably expect the shadow Secretary of State to spell out every detail of the commitments and priorities of the incoming Labour Government that he hopes to serve. But it is amazing to say nothing. After all, the broad totals that we are considering today were announced on Budget day. The hon. Member for Hamilton has had since then to apply the Goschen-Barnett formula to get a rough idea of what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would announce. Instead of giving us a broad indication of priorities, the hon. Member for Hamilton failed to deny that an incoming Labour Government would cut the housing budget by £100 million and the health budget by £200 million. He fails to deny it now. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Why does not he get up and tell us the figure?</p>
	<p>What we do know is that a lot of people in the health service will be sacked. The hon. Gentleman said that he would remove all the administrators, mangers—and, no doubt, their computers—so there will be sackings in the health service when he takes over. He could not even make a commitment about spending on the national health service in the second or third years.</p>
	<p>Why are the Opposition in the extraordinary position, five months from the last possible date for the general election, unable to say anything about their figures? Why is there a vow of silence? The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) perhaps gave the game away when he was challenged by some Labour councillors and refused to make any decisions. He is quoted in 	<i>The Courier & Advertiser</i> on Saturday 7 December saying that the party leadership had taken a policy decision. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It was a clear decision—a decision to remain silent. In his spirit of honesty, the hon. Gentleman said "We have waited too long for this moment. We have dreamt about it and worked for it for 18 years and the last thing that we are going to do is throw away this opportunity to get rid of this Government." When some of the worthy Labour councillors questioned that strategy of total silence, the hon. Member for Leith said, "You can question the strategy, but that is the strategy." That can be roughly translated as go away and boil your heads. The hon. Gentleman then said, "It is about tactical difficulties. There are tactical difficulties if you make a spending commitment which is then turned into a tax bill, and that means that you lose the general election." So that is what it is all about.</p>
	<p>This morning, Labour Members have been given an opportunity to spell out to the Scottish people their priorities for Government, but they have no priorities or policies of any sort. This morning they have not told the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
Scottish people of any potential achievement. They have no vision for the future. I wonder why they want to form a Government—it must be the cars and the nice boxes.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has heard that Government chauffeurs are likely to go on strike next week—perhaps he is not concerned about that these days—so all Ministers will be walking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, we can be sure that the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) will not press for a vote of confidence in the near future, nor for an early general election, until that strike is over and he can be assured of the use of the cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not it astonishing and serious that the Opposition refuse to tell the Scottish people anything about their spending priorities? Of course, we know that one of their major commitments—that of a Scottish Parliament. Would that commitment change the figures before the Committee? It would almost certainly markedly change the aggregate external finance figures for 1998–99 and 1999–2000, because a Scottish Parliament have wholly untrammelled power over Scottish local government finance. Therefore, it would have unlimited power to increase business rates to whatever level it wished. So Labour's Scottish Parliament could add £1,000 million to business rates—clearly, it would have the power to do so. Is the hon. Member for Hamilton saying that it would not have such power? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Hamilton seems to be denying something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) makes her speech she can say that I am talking nonsense, but my understanding of the position is perfectly clear: a Scottish Parliament could add £1,000 million to Scottish public expenditure by increasing the business rates and moving money around between AEF and the other expenditure heads. If that is correct—I believe that it is—it changes the figures before us and has major implications for the Scottish economy, for business and for every other spending head. If Opposition Front=Bench Members answer none of our questions before the end of the debate, they should at least tell us whether a Scottish Parliament would have the power to increase business rates on Scottish industry and commerce by £1,000 million or any sum that it wished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> The extravagant claims that the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has just made have spoiled what had been an entertaining and perceptive speech on the Labour party's predicament. It is technically true that, like the Westminster Parliament, a Scottish Parliament could have such powers. Of course, a Westminster Parliament could increase the rate of tax to 120 per cent., but that does not mean that it would ever do so. The hon. Gentleman does his cause no good by making such extravagant claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
The Secretary of State, however, made such claims when he presented his public expenditure plans. His veneer of good news was wearing even more thin before members of the Grand Committee left Hamilton on Monday, as interested parties were queuing up to expose the stark realities which many of the public services will have to face as a result of the cuts that lie behind the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that the Secretary of State's announcement pretends to do things that it does not. It pretends that small things are, in fact, big things and it ignores the really big things. That we have a basic cut in public expenditure in Scotland lies at the heart of our debate, which, to be fair, the Secretary of State was only too willing to acknowledge. Furthermore, the Labour party accepts the Government's fiscal stance and acknowledges the figures as the baseline from which it would operate in government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever veneer the Secretary of State wraps round the figures, the room created for income tax cuts in the Budget will reflect itself in reduced public services and higher council taxes. I wish to level two charges against the right hon. Gentleman: he is inflicting damage on our public services and, by budgeting for the short term, he is storing up trouble and costs for the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extent of the damage to public service can be seen by examining the detail, even in the area to which the right hon. Gentleman boasts that he is giving most help—the health service. According to the tables, this year's planned provision for health is £4,227 billion, on top of which he has announced for next year a headline figure increase of £148 million. He said that there will be a real increase in funding for the next three years although, in real terms, by 1999 and the year 2000, the increase will be about only £4 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the figure of £148 million in more detail. The claimed real increase of 1.5 per cent. applies only if we compare the figures and take into account the Government's optimistic claim of 2 per cent. inflation. Most health service economists would claim health service specific inflation runs at about 3 per cent. so, of that £148 million, £127 million is immediately accounted for simply to keep pace with inflation, which leaves a net increase of £21 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is widely assumed that medical advances tend to add to health service costs. A frequently used estimate by economists for that is 0.5 per cent.—in other words, £21 million. Therefore, the figure of £148 million has already been reached before the Department of Health's estimate is taken into account, which is that the NHS budget must raise by 0.8 per cent., to enable services to stand still because of the increase in the number of elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have a shortfall of £34 million, even on the item that the Secretary of State boasted was perhaps his biggest act of generosity. There is no reason why we should be generous to the Government, given the unlikelihood of private finance initiative filling the cap, but even if we make allowances for the fact that there has been a cut in capital expenditure, the net increase in funding for revenue services is £15 million. That is exactly the same as the additional amount being spent this year to tide over a straitened national health service during the winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
The Secretary of State's claims for funding the NHS remind me of nothing other than grabbing a handful of sand and watching it all slip through my fingers. It was claimed that the Labour party, like him, would save money from bureaucracy. The right hon. Gentleman identified how much he is saving, but he should not take much credit for trying to save money from additional bureaucracy, which the Government themselves created. It cost the United Kingdom about 457 separate negotiations to agree health service pay, whereas previously there was one round of negations for nurses' pay. For example, annual contracts are continually being renegotiated in the same way as the Forth rail bridge used to be painted, before public expenditure took effect. The Government created the increase in bureaucracy and they are now trying to claw it back. However, at least the Secretary of State put a figure on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Labour party's savings in bureaucracy throughout the United Kingdom is only £100 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is £170 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) has confirmed that the figure is £100 million. I am not sure how much of that will be attributable to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. However, the hon. Member for Hamilton said £170 million—and the hon. Member for Monklands, East said £100 million in Scotland alone. According to my calculations, that must mean that many thousands of jobs would be lost in the health service in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is £100 million in Scotland alone I find it hard to believe that in the rest of the United Kingdom—England, Wales and Northern Ireland—there could have been a saving of only £70 million. There may be a reservoir of riches that can be tapped that none of us know about. We await details with interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the subject of the rough sleepers initiative. The Government's proposals are welcome but overdue and should not divert attention from the assault on the housing budget. Shelter estimates a cut of £177 million in the next financial year. Although the rough sleepers initiative is important for taking people off the streets, the ultimate goal should be to provide them with decent housing. If the budget is cut back, provision for adequate housing—to which people who benefit from the rough sleepers initiative rightly aspire—cannot be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee know that housing problems such as poor conditions, inadequate accommodation of families and the lack of a home are some of the most frequently raised problems at our constituency surgeries. The Government, however, propose to make a bad situation worse by reducing resources available to local authorities and housing associations. The situation is made worse still by the Government's direction to Scottish Homes to channel resources into building homes for home ownership when, in many parts of Scotland—particularly rural Scotland—most people want decent houses at affordable rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
The proposals will have an effect throughout Scotland. The Eildon housing association has written to my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel). It estimates that if the cuts anticipated for Scotland are reflected in the borders, the Eildon housing association's development programme would have only 25 new starts next year instead of the 100 units that it has provided annually during the past 10 years. That is the measure of the cuts that we are facing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to education, I welcome the respite given to the higher education sector. It is good to know that the Adjournment debate, which was answered by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), produced such positive results. I hope that I can expect the same from my Adjournment debate later today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the money that is being provided for the University of the Highlands and Islands, which has broad cross-party support. It is a welcome venture, and the Secretary of State's personal interest in it is very much appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most education in Scotland is delivered through local authorities. The zeal with which Ministers—particularly the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch)—attack local authorities cannot encourage us to think other than that local education budgets must bear the brunt of cuts once more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local councils make easy targets because none of them are Tory run. When schools close, when teachers are not replaced, when music tuition is withdrawn or nursery schools do not open, the public should know that the blame lies principally with the Government and not with the local councils, on which the Government try to place that blame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second charge that I lay against the Government concerns their short-term approach, conducted at long-term expense. Lack of investment in education is but one example. Obsession with the public finance initiative is another. Many local authorities will be obliged to close community centres or put up charges, leaving more young people to hang around. That would result in increased pressures on policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes no sense to drive local authorities to cut environmental health services. Scotland has one of the highest incidences of food poisoning in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we fail to invest in housing, we undermine small construction firms so that the cost of unemployment rises; we shall see the re-emergence of diseases such as rickets and tuberculosis. A group of 600 homeless men screened in London recently were found to have an incidence of active TB that was 200 times greater than the general population. Consequently greater demands are made on our health service—but, of course, that would be covered in a different financial year's Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The costs of failing to invest in housing, health and education are seldom featured in Red Books or in tables, but they are real. The Government fail in their duty to the public if they fail to acknowledge them.

Sadly, the official Opposition are complicit in that failure. A significant feature of the last few days has been the embarrassed silence of Labour spokespersons when asked whether they would restore what has been taken in cuts. Interest groups increasingly find that new Labour is a commitment-free zone. It might have been thought that the Labour party would have learnt its lesson last year. Unlike us, Labour Members did not vote against income tax cuts. We believed that it was right to vote against them because, not to do so would have contributed to greater public debt and underfunding in the public services. We were right. The price has been the highest ever national debt, larger class sizes, schools and hospital wards closed and local services cut. Again this year, the Labour party repeats its folly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

For an outward appearance of fiscal respectability, new Labour has surely forfeited the right to criticise cuts with any conviction or to be the advocates of better public services. My party published an alternative and costed budget showing our priorities for investment in health and education and how it would be funded. We shall shortly publish a charter for housing in Scotland. On all those matters, we have evidenced our belief in investing for the long term. People know it to be true that it is not possible to get a quartsworth of public services out of a pintsworth of resources. With lower taxes, we will have poorer services. The Government acknowledge that because they do not mind. The Labour party no longer has the courage to admit it. At the polls, we as Liberal Democrats will be rewarded for our candour and our willingness to invest wisely in the people and the future fabric of our nation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the Secretary of State and his Ministers have two main motives in making this statement. First, in the run-up to the general election, they want to force Labour councils to cut and privatise services and to increase council taxes so that the Government can shriek that everything is Labour's fault. Secondly, the few bits of good news in the statement are just a desperate attempt by Conservative Members to win votes. Clearly, they do not live in the real world if they think that the people of Scotland will forget the trail of broken promises over the past 17 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State claims that he favours health, and pledges an increase of £148 million. I welcome any increase in health expenditure, but even more money could be made available for patient care if we ended the bureaucracy of the internal market that the Government have imposed on the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither I nor health service workers will ever forget the key role played by the Secretary of State when, in a previous role, he determinedly pursued the privatisation of the national health service, once again ignoring the vast majority of Scottish opinion. If he is serious about making more money available for patient care, he should disband NHS trusts tomorrow and use the money to employ more nurses and to give them a decent pay increase and end the lottery of local pay bargaining which costs time and money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the additional £15 million that the Secretary of State has said will be available for the increased winter demands on the NHS, but I would suggest that costs could be avoided if people, particularly the elderly, were able to live in warm homes and walk along gritted pavements. Those points were clearly put to me when I recently attended the Dunfermline elderly forum. Pensioners there blamed Government cuts in local government expenditure for the insufficient gritting of roads and pavements and told me how many frail, elderly and disabled people had, in the recent icy conditions, ended up at the local hospital with fractures and other injuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of warm homes, especially for the elderly, could be used to avoid additional health service expenditure. Many old people dread this time of year. There is not much Christmas joy for people on a low income. At this time of year, hon. Members see dozens of pensioners spending hours in indoor shopping centres, such as Kingsgate and Dunfermline. It is not that they have loads of money to spend; it is because they cannot afford to stay at home and keep their homes heated. To put it bluntly, for many pensioners that I meet, at this time of year there is a choice between heating and eating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Secretary of State that, in Scotland, one quarter of elderly people have no heat in their main bedroom and enjoy seeing ice on the inside of their windows, and that nearly one in eight people over 75 have no central heating, no double glazing and no warm insulation. The public expenditure statement has done nothing to address that; it has just built on the Chancellor's refusal to cut VAT on fuel and it has also ensured that, once again, there will be a standstill budget for home energy efficiency programmes, so that excellent organisations, such as Heatwise Fife and others throughout Scotland, will, once again, have to cut their services, even though they are desperately needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
The provision of suitable housing is also a key part of community care. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) said, the Secretary of State made no mention of community care in his statement. He said nothing about halting the closure of NHS continuing care beds, nothing about making more resources available for respite care and domiciliary services and nothing about the one in seven Scots who are carers, the majority of whom look after elderly friends and relatives. It is reckoned that Scotland's carers alone save the Treasury £2.5 billion a year, yet no official resources have been made to meet their assessed need and to help local authorities meet that assessed need under the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995, which came into force this year. Indeed, as social work services face another cut, carers will have an increasing burden to compensate for the gaps in services. The Government have somehow managed to spend £200 billion of North sea oil assets at the same time as telling the elderly that they can no longer afford to keep them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On education, Fife is held in high esteem throughout the United Kingdom for its education service, yet the Government are cutting funding for education in Scotland by £21 million and continuing to push the nursery voucher scheme. The Secretary of State will recall being handed a petition by Fife councillors at the recent Scottish Grand Committee meeting at Cupar. Perhaps he will recall that one of the councillors said that if the Secretary of State was really interested in pursuing the development of quality nursery education, he should visit Fife and investigate how, for a number of years, it has been able to provide all three and four-year-olds with a nursery place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other matters that I should like to discuss, but I appreciate that time is short—and that shortage was not helped by the lengthy speeches and interventions of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We earlier discussed job losses in local government: further job losses—and perhaps compulsory redundancies—are likely to follow. We also discussed the fact that in the public expenditure statement no mention was made of improvements in public transport or the maintenance of concessionary fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Christmas spirit, I shall end with two pieces of good news. First, the Secretary of State will be pleased to hear that I am indeed glad that he announced extra funding for the police. I am confident that the chief constable of Fife, and police forces throughout the country, will find some Christmas cheer from the announcement.

The second piece of good news—and the best piece of Christmas cheer for the people of Scotland—is that this will be the last Christmas that the Secretary of State will spend in government. I also hope that it will be the last Christmas that the Secretary of State and the other Conservative members of the Committee will spend in Parliament. They know that they are on their way out: that is why they go on incessantly and it explains the jovial comments of the hon. Member for Eastwood, who is obviously looking forward to a lengthy retirement, and the persistent questioning of those on the Opposition Front Bench. The Scottish people will remember what the Government have done, and they will give them the same short shrift that the Government gave to the views of the Scottish people. We all look forward with Christmas cheer because we know that the end of 18 years of Conservative Government—and the indecency and indignity that they brought on so many communities—is in sight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always grateful to you, Mr. Hogg, for keeping me in line with the House's conventions. I know that, when winding up, it is conventional to say what a good debate there has been. I regret to say, however, that in all honesty I cannot say that we have a good debate—and I say that with all respect to my honourable Friends. Quite frankly, Conservative Members have treated this morning's sitting like a cabaret turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) and for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire) had to bring Conservative Members back to the real issues. People outside the House will view us with shame if, when we discuss matters that are as serious as this, we behave as though we are in a pre-Christmas party. We had the unedifying sight of the Secretary of State for Scotland getting himself in a fair lather at the start of our debate, and he failed to answer any of the questions that were put to him. It has been my privilege during my career to work with some significant Secretaries of State, including the late William Ross, Bruce Millan and Gordon Campbell, but in Committee today the office of the Secretary of State for Scotland was demeaned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Member of Parliament for Monklands, East, which is in Lanarkshire, I have to report that in the past 12 hours the E.coli crisis has worsened considerably: another outlet has been affected and my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton had to announce the 1 1 th death. The Secretary of State for Scotland did not see fit to mention the E. coli crisis despite the fact that it is fast becoming a tragedy that is attracting widespread interest—a dubious privilege for the west of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a statement on it on Monday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) could have some courtesy, which a number of his colleagues have not displayed, I could make my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even Japan, which held the record for deaths from E. coli, has been outstripped by us. There are public expenditure implications from the E. coli crisis for the health service and for environmental health. The Secretary of State ducked the fact that environmental health depts will be affected by the cuts that he is imposing on local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State will allow me to finish my point, I will allow him to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have to consider compensation for those in the retail trade who will be further affected by the events of the past 12 hours. The Committee would welcome the opportunity to hear, in a coherent manner, what the Government are going to do about the E. coli crisis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's sentiments of concern for the people who have died as a result of the outbreak are shared by those on both sides of the Committee. As for her point about environmental health officers, she will be aware that the provision for environmental health

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
is part of the GAE provision for local government which will be maintained. There is no question of any reduction. I hope that she welcomes that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State does not realize—or perhaps he has been in the public relations business so long that addressing issues is alien to him—that environmental health services are part of the choices that local government has to make as a consequence of the Government's package. There is a clear Conservative vendetta against local government. As the right hon. Member for Dumfries said, the Government frequently present impenetrable packages to the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Marvin) returned the debate to the real issues—carers in our constituencies, those in need in our constituencies, children in schools in our constituencies: they are the victims of the vendetta against local government. Is it not strange that the Conservatives condemn the Opposition for our attitude to local government but 53 per cent. of people in opinion polls support us while only 12 per cent. support them, and they have absolutely no support in local government? Does it not occur to the Secretary of State that the Scottish public have given a clear response to the Labour party's honesty? We know that when we form a Government we will have to mop up the mess of public finance in Scotland left by the Conservatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the announcement this morning—although I was not given an opportunity to see it in advance—that extra resources will be available for early intervention. I wonder whether the Minister will pay tribute to those Labour-controlled local authorities that pioneered work in early intervention in education. I hope that the Government have learnt a lesson from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take up the point about money for higher education. We see the Conservatives giving with the one hand and taking with the other. It is interesting that neither the Secretary of State nor his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Robertson) talked about the impact of the teacher superannuation scheme on universities in the search for greater efficiency. It will largely affect the new universities and those that have taken over other colleges. One university estimates that changes to the superannuation scheme will cost those institutions £350,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of points were made about the Labour party and our commitments when we win a general election. We have seen from the hysteria this morning that Conservative Members are well aware that their days are numbered. My party, which is proud of its leader—unlike the Conservatives—has made five clear pledges to the people of Scotland that are realisable and which we shall honour. We will not make false promises. In 1992, the Conservative party promised that it would not increase taxation, but have suffered seven increases in taxation during the lifetime of the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to higher education, the Committee of Vice—Chancellors and Principals of universities in England and Wales has drawn attention to the fact that the Budget will dramatically affect institutions of higher education. It is estimated that six additional taxes will fall on them. In their narrow quest for votes, the Government are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
misleading the public by making promises with sleight of hand and mirrors. The public want honesty—they will get honesty from the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I state categorically that a key pledge of an incoming Labour Government will be to reduce class sizes in the first three years of primary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By how much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will initially bring classes down to 30 pupils, which will cost £5 million. That will be funded by the assisted places scheme, a scheme that is designed to benefit and subsidise private schools. It has nothing to do with education; it is about subsidising private schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Labour Government will introduce a Scottish Parliament. We shall do so for reasons that have been proved today. The fact is that one man's decision can impact on all of our constituents; and when the Secretary of State comes to the House to answer for his actions, he does so as if it is a joke or a cabaret. A Scottish Parliament will be responsive to the people of Scotland. It will be in line with their wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will ensure that £100 million is taken from the meaningless health service bureaucracy set up by the Government and put directly into patient care. The right hon. Member for Dumfries said how proud Scotland is of its health service. Yes, we are proud of it; but we shall ensure more places for patients in Scottish hospitals by reducing bureaucracy. There will be no more waiting lists for people suffering from cancer and other life—threatening illnesses. Those issues matter to real people. They do not want the showmanship of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Springburn mentioned the Stone of Destiny. It was nice to see the Stone of Destiny coming back to Scotland, but if the time that the Secretary of State spent planning that Ruritanian fantasy had been spent addressing Scotland's real problems, he might have been in a more contrite mood this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party will also ensure that 250,000 young men and women throughout Britain will be put into employment, thereby regenerating the economy rather than stifling it as the Government have done. We will be prudent with public finances. To use a Lanarkshire expression, we have suffered 17 years of people trying to run the country when they could not even run a menage. The people of Scotland deserve better. They will receive better as soon as the Labour party crosses to the Government Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, we saw the mob opposite practising for Opposition. I should tell them that the best way to prepare for opposition is by winning their seats. Only one Scottish Conservative Member looks forward with any enthusiasm to the general election—the right hon. Member for Dumfries, who will not be standing. If Conservative Members want to join the general election debate, they should stand up and be counted in their own party. They should ensure that the leader of the Conservative party, who is supported by some Conservative Members, calls a general election. This morning's events have made it obvious that a general election is needed now. [	<i>Interruption</i>] The Parliamentary Under—Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), seems to find that amusing. I find it interesting that every time the Under—Secretary is invited

to appear on television or on a joint platform with me, he has a prior engagement. He has his pals around him this morning, so he is being extremely brave. One of the key issues for Labour at the general election will be education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady say why she has not replied to the letter I wrote to her three weeks ago asking about the Labour party's plans for further and higher education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wrote to the hon. Gentleman inviting him to debate the very issues that I have raised this morning, as they will be of great importance in the general election. Since I became a Front-Bench spokesperson, I have repeatedly asked him questions on the Floor of the House, but I have never had an answer. We want answers now from Conservative Members. They should be ashamed of the way in which they have conducted themselves this morning. The day of reckoning is coming, and I look forward to the day when there are enough Labour Members⤔ [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady used the word cabaret, and the Committee is now in danger of turning into a theatre. Does the hon. Lady want to conclude her speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am merely thanking you for your guidance, Mr. Hogg. Conservative Members have not properly dealt with the issues, and the people of Scotland will stand in judgment of them—they do not like to be patronised in the way that they have been this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.51 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) to this extent: we have not had a good debate this morning. The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) devoted his entire speech to talking about everything and nothing—certainly not public expenditure in Scotland. Labour Members have given a vintage example of the economic genius for which they are famous. They make the same tired old allegations about Conservative expenditure programmes with a total disregard for financial realities. Most outrageously, they arrogantly refuse to offer the people of Scotland any concrete alternative proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that, in a parliamentary democracy, an Opposition are entitled to be as scathingly critical of a Government's programme as they want. By the same token, the electorate are entitled to know the Opposition's alternative proposals before—rather than after—they vote in a general election. It is a measure of the extent to which the Labour party takes its Scottish vote for granted that Labour Members do not see fit to tell the Scottish people of their spending priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
I note that the Labour Members whom we might expect to be honest about what they wanted to spend money on vacated the Room early. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), for example, seems constantly to get himself into trouble. Last year, he told us that he would fund local government from the health budget; this year, when he appeared on a television programme with me, he said that he would cut the law and order budget. That is what old Labour—real Labour—is all about; it wants to help local government at the expense of our public expenditure priorities, which were expressed clearly and concisely by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm), to whom I referred in a rather croaky speech on Monday, has also put his foot in it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said in his entertaining and illuminating speech, the hon. Gentleman was honest enough to tell local Labour party members that Labour would promise nothing; it would go into the general election with no pledges, as pledges could mean taxes, taxes could be costed and that could lose Labour the election. That is typical of the Labour party; it will make no pledges on priorities in public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A real Government have to make such decisions day in, day out. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made it perfectly clear where our priorities lie; indeed, he has pledged that year on year for the whole of the next Parliament there will be real increases in the national health service. He has quantified savings in administration and mentioned the £18 million that will be saved, which will go into front-line health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) was right to query the Opposition's figures. What are they? They seem to suggest a saving of —170 million for the whole of the United Kingdom, but the hon. Member for Hamilton said it was for the whole of Scotland. The hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) disagreed and said that the figure was —100 million, but the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said that it was impossible to have that level of saving. The long and short of it is that if that sort of saving is envisaged by the Opposition, they can forget about increasing the number of nurses, as referred to by the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West, because that will go by the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Dunfermline, West might be interested to know that since 1979—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. I was simply anticipating your well-chosen words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it clear to the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West that since 1979, when the Conservative Government first took office, we have increased the number of nurses in Scotland by 9,000–36 per cent. The number of general practitioners has been increased by 20.6 per cent. and consultants by 23 per cent. There is much more treatment in the health service under our Government than we have ever seen before, or will see under any potential Labour Government. I need only look at my own area and Aberdeen Royal Hospitals trust. Some years ago, heart bypass surgery was done occasionally—about 50 operations a year. Now, there are 550 bypass operations a year. Patients in the area are benefiting from the expenditure that the Government have put into the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Springbum talked about planning policies and asked about encouraging building on brownfield sites. I am as keen as he is to protect green belts, which we try to do in the planning department. He may be interested to know that £9 million was added to the Scottish Homes budget last year to help clear and prepare more sites in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries referred to the distribution formula for local authority resources taking more account of rural areas. He will be aware that the Government are committed to a fundamental review of the GAE system and the first two major work programmes in the review will be on rurality and urbanity. However, the arguments of the rural areas are counteracted by those of the urban areas. My right hon. Friend referred to capping and I assure him that the Government will ensure that the taxpayer is protected. We shall keep a tight control on expenditure to protect council tax payers. There will be a limit of 0.5 per cent. of expenditure that is within the capping regime, but there are items outwith it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
The hon. Member for Hamilton said that there was no capital programme in the national health service except for private finance initiative capital, which shows that he has not attempted to look at the position. There are gross capital expenditure plans of nearly —500 million for the next three years. The hon. Gentleman should realise that his party advocates PFI. It will mean that assets are brought on stream sooner than they would be using public expenditure. The Edinburgh Royal infirmary was mentioned. It is a lengthy process to get the best value for money to ensure that the people of Edinburgh and the surrounding area benefit from the new infirmary. They will get it through PFI, to which the Government are totally committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A responsible Government cut their coat according to their cloth, which is the crucial difference between us and our opponents. We manage to do more while spending less. The Opposition's ambition is very clear: to do less while spending more. Let us not forget whose money they are lusting to spend? There is no such thing as public money; it is taxpayers' money—yours and mine, Mr. Hogg, and everyone else's What a lot there will be around under a Labour Government. There will be the tartan tax, taking £6 a week from the average Scottish family, the trade tax, the business rate returned to local government control and council tax spiralling out of control under Labour authorities—a fiscal fiesta of unreconstructed socialism. Our public expenditure settlement is a fair allocation based on the priority status of health, education, law and order, and industry. The Opposition parties rejected our priorities but do not specify theirs. Their instincts are prodigal and irresponsible. This Government will always put the taxpayer's interests first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> that the Committee do now adjourn. [	<i>Mr. McLoughlin.</i>]</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have obtained this important Adjournment debate on Government policy in regard to the stationing of an emergency salvage tug in the waters around Orkney and Shetland. I welcome the Minister of State, who will reply to the debate, and am grateful to the Secretary of State's office for informing me that it endeavoured to get a Minister from the Department of Transport to reply—because the matter is the responsibility of that Department. Because the Minister with responsibility for shipping, Lord Goschen, sits in the House of Lords, the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) speaks on shipping matters in the House; regrettably, however, he could not be here to reply. So while we can get the Defence Secretary to Cupar, The Chancellor of the Exchequer to Aberdeen, the Prime Minister to Dumfries and the Secretary of State for Social Security to Dunfermline, it is not possible to get a junior Minister from the Department of Transport to the House of Commons. Never mind—that's the way the cookie crumbles. The Secretary of State says that the Minister is in the Lords: if he had been listening, he would know that I said that and that, as the director of ministerial responsibilities told me, a Minister—the hon. Member for Battersea—speaks on shipping matters in the House. However, I accept that his Department made efforts to try to secure the hon. Member for Battersea for our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of the issue goes back a long way, although the concern of the islands' communities has intensified since the grounding of the oil tanker Braer at Garthsness, Shetland on 5 January 1993. In the eighth report of the royal commission on environmental pollution, published in October 1981, Shetland council expressed concern about the availability—or lack of it—of deep-sea salvage tugs of sufficient power to handle a very large crude carrier. Paragraph 7.121 of that report states:
	<br><q><p>"The Council observed that there was no salvage presence in Shetland, that by the mid 1980s some 1,000 tankers a year, including many VLCCs, would be using the Sullom Voe terminal and that sooner or later a major pollution incident would occur which might have been avoided if a salvage tug had been rapidly available."</p></q>
That was written 12 years before the grounding of the Braer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their response to that royal commission report, the Government said that there had been a study report on salvage capacity and stated:
	<br><q><p>"The study report is now being examined and will enable the Government to decide whether any improvements are needed in the general purpose salvage capability which is at present available."</p></q>
The efficacy of the Government's examination of the report can perhaps be measured by the fact that, more than 12 years later, Lord Donaldson's inquiry on the grounding of the Braer reported that:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
	<br><q><p>"There is not sufficient salvage capacity in UK waters at the moment, nor is it coherently organised…Action needs to be taken to achieve the ends of the action taken by other governments".</p></q>
Since the Braer went to ground, Orkney and Shetland have made copious representations for better maritime safety around our shores. We have asked for radar surveillance and in the longer term we want introduction of transponders. In addition to making representations to Lord Donaldson's inquiry, the islands' councils and I have had frequent correspondence with successive shipping Ministers on the issue. The near presence of an emergency salvage tug is essential in regard both to radar and transponders. The fitting of transponders or the detection by radar of a vessel in difficulty can lead to an early alert for emergency towing vessels, and thus make them all the more effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regrettably, Lord Donaldson did not go as far as recommending a salvage vessel for northern waters, although he recommended a salvage tug presence in the English channel, the Minches and the western approaches. To date, the Government have responded by chartering for the winter months a salvage vessel based in Dover and Stornoway and for this winter, a vessel has been added at Falmouth—a belated gesture following the debacle of the Sea Empress grounding in Pembrokeshire last February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Knowledgeable local opinion in my constituency has challenged the omission of the waters around Orkney and Shetland from the list of salvage tug presence. Not only is there a considerable amount of oil tanker traffic—vessels using Sullom Voe and Flotta terminals; as well as ships in transit, the number of which is likely to increase with developments in the Atlantic oil province—but we are considering an area that is important nationally and internationally for the quality of its wildlife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That area experiences some of the most ferocious gales and storms in the United Kingdom, especially during the winter months. Moreover, the Pentland firth, in which there are more than 6,000 vessels in transit each year, is widely recognised as one of the most treacherous pieces of water around our coasts. Given that and the importance of a clean maritime environment for key industries—such as fishing, fish farming and tourism—a most compelling case for added protection emerges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not simply local self-pleading. In July 1993, a report to the Coastguard Agency from Murray Fenton Associates recommended five areas, including Orkney and Shetland, that needed to be covered by emergency towing vessels. In January 1995, the consultants DNV Technica presented to the chief executive of the Coastguard Agency the results of a risk analysis, undertaken at the request of the marine pollution control unit. That report showed that placing emergency towing vessels in Dover, the Hebrides and the south west approaches reduced risk significantly, but Fair Isle and the North channel remained at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most significant work has been done at the behest of the Coastguard Agency by the emergency towing study team under the chairmanship of Captain C.P.R. Belton, RN., which reported last year. The investigation was established to take forward Lord Donaldson's recommendations on salvage capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The study team, which defined the Fair Isles areas as the
	<br><q><p>"regions of North Scotland and Shetland, including the islands groups of Orkney and Shetland",</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
concluded that the area should be classified a secondary danger area. The study team particularly identified high risks during winter months and recommended that the area should be provided with ETV cover from the beginning of October until the end of March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key question that the Minister must answer is why the Government have ignored the recommendation of the study team that is set up to consider such matters. Some of the excuses are already familiar, and we might hear the Minister use them again this morning. Echoing Lord Donaldson's findings, Ministers have hidden behind the excuse that
	<br><q><p>"all major ports, including those in Orkney and Shetland, have tugs available, and in most cases harbour tugs could provide the necessary first aid".</p></q>
Local harbour authorities have always rejected that argument, saying that harbour tugs would be unequal to the task if a heavily laden tanker became disabled in severe weather. Their view was comprehensively supported by Captain Belton's study team. Its report concluded:
	<br><q><p>"There are three tugs in Flotta with a bollard pull of 50 tons and although capable, they were designed as harbour tugs and would probably be ineffective in severe weather outside Scapa Flow."</p></q>
On Shetland's Sullom Voe tugs, the report states:
	<br><q><p>"their ability to respond to an emergency"—</p></q>
that is, to a stricken vessel at sea in severe winter conditions—
	<br><q><p>"is extremely limited and certainly cannot be relied upon."</p></q>
Yet, although those comments hole the Government's excuses well below the Waterline, this October—more than 12 months after Captain Belton presented his report to the Government agency—the Minister with responsibility for shipping, Lord Goschen, is still writing to the Convener of Shetland Islands council in these terms:
	<br><q><p>"Harbour tugs can also provide some cover".</p></q>
There is no convincing evidence that Ministers ever read the advice given to them by those whom they appoint to investigate particular issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister say that the Government no longer hides behind the excuse of harbour tugs being present at Flotta and Sullom Voe? Given that the excuse has been disposed of, will he accept that the case is all the more compelling for an emergency salvage tug presence around Orkney and Shetland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, this debate provides an opportunity for the Government to confirm that they fully support existing arrangements for salvage tug cover. Speaking at a recent conference on maritime disaster response, Lord Goschen hinted that even the existing cover might be of limited duration. At the same conference, the chief executive of the Coastguard Agency, Mr. Chris Harris, made the somewhat breathtaking claim that, from a true economic viewpoint, the benefits rarely outweigh the costs. No doubt the Government think the same about household insurance premiums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even that view is not supported by Captain Belton, who refers in his report to
	<br><q><p>"HM Coastguard's report on the unquestionable success of the winter trial with ETVs stationed in Dover and Stornoway".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
He referred specifically to the first four-month period when the Coastguard Agency placed the vessel, Brodospas Sun, at Stornoway—I shall leave aside the need to charter a Croatian flag-flying vessel to undertake emergency cover in British waters. The report noted that the vessel was tasked 14 times over the 16 weeks, including a significant escort of the damaged tanker, Mimosa, from the Hebrides to Land End. It stated:
	<br><q><p>"had she broken, she would have posed a considerable threat to the coastline she was passing at that moment and the Brodospas Sun would have been in position to prevent a catastrophic oil pollution incident."</p></q>
As further evidence of the value of such tugs, the leading article in 	<i>Lloyd's List</i> of 18 October this year said:
	<br><q><p>"The Dover tug, the Far Turbot, was tasked on 42 occasions during the 1995£96 season … and provided emergency towage assistance on two occasions. If one of these two emergencies was a potential Sea Empress, the costs saved merely in tourism terms would amply compensate for six years operating costs of the UK's towage team".</p></q>
Other nations make similar provision. The emergency towing study report stated:
	<br><q><p>"Several foreign, and especially European, Governments have concluded that, irrespective of cost, ETVs provide a high degree of protection for their coastlines and that the costs are worth paying".</p></q>
Is it too much to ask our Government to take a similarly enlightened view? Not to do so may achieve short-term savings, but will the Minister accept that the costs of not doing so can be immense and incalculable? Shetland escaped a disaster in January 1993, but it was not damage free. I am still in contact with constituents whose businesses have been harmed. A fisherman telephoned me at the weekend to say that he is now obliged to go to sea in all weather conditions when he should not, because he has not had a speedy settlement of his claim by the international oil pollution compensation fund. Such a cost, in addition to the ecological cost, can come about as a result of an unwillingness to invest modestly in giving our coasts adequate protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, I wish the Government to take decisive action by placing an appropriate vessel in northern waters before the winter gets any older. At the very least, I should like them to express their willingness to examine possible options for cover. A commercial business in my constituency has suggested that the provision of a larger fifth tug at Sullom Voe could be used for harbour and emergency cover purposes. I acknowledge that the practicability of such a proposal would depend on there being a tug of suitable size to combine both roles, but at least it shows that there has been some thinking on different ways in which to address the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, British Petroleum said that it would allow the safety ship at its Foinaven field to double as an emergency vessel in the event of another Braer-type incident. Again, that would require more detail, for example, on the extent to which the Coastguard Agency would have powers to direct the vessel in a given set of circumstances. Again, it would be useful to know whether Ministers or the Coastguard Agency are investigating those options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents have shown remarkable patience as Ministers have turned down requests for adequate maritime protection. Their patience, however, wears extremely thin when expert advice is ignored and when short-term financial considerations and departmental efficiency gains seem to take precedence over the proper
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
safeguarding of our coasts, our wildlife and people's livelihoods. There is little to be gained after an incident has happened by saying, "You were warned" or "We told you so". By then, it is too late and, as Shetland and Pembrokeshire have both experienced, it is too late. Before it is too late again, I trust that the Minister can promise us that definite action will be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.14 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) on his success in obtaining the debate on the Adjournment. As Minister with responsibility for tourism and educational matters, I visited Shetland, as I have done with members of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. I am well aware of the importance of the hon. Gentleman's views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the hon. Gentleman's interest in emergency towing vessels that are chartered by the Government in those areas of a major importance—the Orkneys and Shetland. He may be reassured that discussions are continuing on the issue that he raised and that the Government will continue to take them forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the loss of the tanker Braer off the southern coast of the Shetland isles in Janaury 1993, the Government asked Lord Donaldson of Lymington to lead an inquiry on whether any further measures were appropriate and feasible to protect the United Kingdom coastline from pollution from merchant shipping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The origin of the inquiry was the loss of the Braer, a laden tanker bound from Norway to Canada with a cargo of 84,000 tonnes of Norwegian crude oil. The accident was investigated by the marine accident investigation branch. The Committee may remember that the anchor handler, Star Sirius, sailed from Lerwick and came very close to getting a line on board the Braer just before she grounded. The chief inspector found that the master and crew of Star Sirius displayed excellent seamanship and did all that they possibly could to establish a tow. He also found that the Sullom Voe harbour tugs and the Lerwick lifeboat put out to sea without hesitation when asked to do so, in the best traditions of the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Donaldson's inquiry team consulted widely and comprehensively, locally and nationally, in Government, commercial and private sectors in a process which took 15 months. The resultant document, "Saver Ships, Cleaner Seas", was published in May 1994 and made 103 recommendations. The Government have accepted 91 of them and are considering a further eight. They have rejected only four. Half the accepted recommendations have been implemented; implementation of the rest is in progress and in many cases international agreement is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prompt action was undertaken to follow through Lord Donaldson's recommendations on the provision of emergency towing cover. Where, previously, commercially developed international salvage tugs traditionally would go to the aid of disabled vessels in the knowledge that large salvage awards could result from the success of such a venture, such vessels are now becoming depleted in number as fewer ships succumb to accidents, reducing the numbers of tugs readily available to provide emergency towing assistance. Lord Donaldson's report suggested certain areas around the United Kingdom where emergency towing cover might best be deployed. It also
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
suggested that the shipping industry should be charged to cover the cost of these vessels, in line with the user-pays principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Lord Donaldson recognised the importance of the northern isles, a degree of objectivity had to be applied in the interests of the United Kingdom as a whole. For example, Lord Donaldson concluded that the Dover strait was the area of highest risk in terms of potential for an accident. There are more than 250 cargo vessels and tankers in any one 24-hour period on passage through the strait and 200 passenger and cargo ferry crossings between England and the continent. In a moment, I will go into detail on the Government's perception of Orkney and Shetland as far as emergency towing requirements are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to ensure full and proper assessment of the risks involved, the Coastguard Agency commissioned a comprehensive study of tug requirements. A tug evaluation team, headed by Captain Chris Belton RN, was asked to investigate and to include, in particular, a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of providing any vessels. His report, presented in December 1995, concluded that areas of risk could be prioritised. Using risk factors such as traffic density, confinement of traffic, geographical conditions, trading and ship course patterns, those areas were gauged as objectively as possible. The very nature of maritime transport obviously involves an element of risk, and the provision of an emergency towing vessel is not necessarily a panacea to all possible exigencies. However, it is possible with forethought and planning to reduce that risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Captain Belton's report identified three areas deemed to be of highest priority: first, the Dover strait; secondly, the Minhes; and, thirdly, the south west Approaches. The two other areas identified, but with a significantly lower risk factor were, first, the Northern Isles—Shetland and Orkney—and, secondly, the north channel; that is, Northern Ireland and west Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The risk analysis applied to the above areas demonstrated that Shetland attracts a ranking of fifth in importance. That evolves primarily from low—traffic densities, which is apparent in comparison with that of the Dover strait. The risk is lessened considerably by the availability and capability of local harbour tugs in both Orkney and Shetland—two in excess of 40 tonnes bollard pull and three in excess of 50 tonnes. A considerable amount of offshore explanatory and production work is undertaken west of Shetland, where BP will be maintaining a purpose-built emergency response vessel, in addition to the normal offshore towing and supply vessels that service the oil industry. Captain Belton's report stated that those resources would provide a reasonable degree of cover to the northern isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, Captain Belton investigated the processes adopted in other European countries and, in particular, the type, design, size and power requirement for emergency towing vessels, which the United Kingdom might wish to deploy. The Coastguard Agency decided that further evaluation of the effectiveness of emergency towing vessels was required before any long-term commitment should be made to the considerable Government expenditure involved. Emergency towing vessels are a very expensive option, and we have to be absolutely sure that proper value for money is demonstrably achieved. It would cost more than £2 million a year to provide a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
tug, year round, in Shetland. Nonetheless, the Government are exploring very seriously the matter of a possible joint venture in Shetland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the Coastguard Agency decided that, although arguments can be presented to establish emergency towing vessels on an all-year-round basis, a degree of common sense had to be applied to the number of vessels, their precise locations and the period of charter. As the vessels are of a preventive nature and, generally speaking, weather conditions can be expected to be worse in winter, the Government decided that emergency towing vessels should be established only in the three primary designated areas and, furthermore, only for the winter period. That takes into account the needs of the entire United Kingdom. The Coastguard Agency has been in correspondence with commercial enterprises in Shetland to consider possible joint arrangements in the provision of emergency towing, and how these might be of benefit. The discussion will continue, but without commitment at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a trial period, therefore, the Government have undertaken to charter emergency towing vessels, with associated salvage expertise, to assess their effectiveness in the three defined and chosen locations. For the winter periods of 1994£95, 1995£96 and 1996£97, two emergency towing vessels were chartered from established towing and salvage companies and stationed at Dover to provide cover for the English channel and the Dover strait, and at Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides to provide cover fo the Minches. Furthermore, for this winter season, a third emergency towing vessel has been established at Falmouth to provide cover of the south western approaches. An interim report on the first two years' activity is in preparation and will shortly be published. That will assist the Government in a decision on the future of emergency towing vessel cover. However, I shall draw to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister for Aviation and Shipping the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the chartered emergency towing vessels, the Coastguard Agency is at present concluding an agreement with the British Tugowners Association on the provision of harbour tugs, UK-wide, in an emergency. That agreement will allow any coastguard rescue centre to call upon the services of available local tugs when required. All coastguard rescue centres maintain an up-to-date database of all local tugs and their availability and capabilities. In the event that an emergency towing facility is required in the relevant area, the coastguard will be able to call upon the services of those local harbour tugs. Furthermore, the nature of North sea oil and gas production in the area will inevitably mean that other powerful vessels with towing capability may be available. There are now three emergency towing vessels, available 24 hours a day, throughout a period when weather conditions may be expected to be poor, whereas previously there were none. Further decisions will be based on the outcome of evaluation of the present trials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to make two points. First, the Minister said that a further valuation would be carried out and he referred to a report that will be published shortly. Can he tell the Committee what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
Her Majesty's coastguard's report said on the unquestionable success of the winter trial with ETVs stationed in Dover and Stornoway referred to in paragraph 1.8 of Captain Belton's report? What does that refer to and can we have that report published, because it already appears to be in the public domain?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister acknowledge that Captain Belton concluded that
	<br><q><p>"the Fair Isle Operating Area should be classified as a Secondary Danger Area and be provided with ETV cover during the winter months only?"</p></q>
If the Minister acknowledges that that is the case, will he explain why, a year after Captain Belton made that recommendation, the Government have not acted on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My priority, as I have just stated to the Committee, in terms of Captain Belton's report, is to make inquiries about what information is publically available and to ensure that the hon. Gentleman receives whatever is readily available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Gentleman for the concerns expressed by him on that important issue and I will ensure that full consideration is taken by the Government on the points that he has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Great interest has been shown in the future of the coastguard service on the islands of Orkney and Shetland. The review was carried out by experienced serving coastguard officers and the Department of Transport's staff inspectors. The main thrust of the review was to put the right people in the right numbers in the right place at the right time. It recommended a restructuring of the service, including the introduction of new grades to enhance the operation of support, supervision and decision making in coastguard operations rooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to questions about staffing levels at the coastguard stations at Shetland and Pentland, I must refer the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland to the answers which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will provide later this afternoon. However, I am prepared to state that the review of the coastguard service will result in more staff, of higher calibre, following the introduction of "Focus for Change" in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The coastguard's raison d'etre is to save lives and it prides itself on being the most modern maritime emergency service in the world. The recommendations contained in the review will provide for even higher standards of professionalism and resources to meet the very-growing demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the report. It is purely factual and draws no conclusions. The trials are still being reviewed but no long-term decision has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the use of transponders and radar identification. That is subject to debate in the International Maritime Organisation. We have pioneered that debate and have placed a trial system around the United Kingdom, including Scotland. That covers the north-west of Scotland but not Shetland and Orkney. I shall pass on the hon. Gentleman's representations on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the event of an incident in Orkney and Shetland, the coastguard has considerable resources available, including local harbour tugs and North sea offshore towing and supply vessels.

I thank the hon.

They were well recommended to come and I hope that I did a little to encourage tourism for future years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
