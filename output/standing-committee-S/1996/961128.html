	<p>[MRS. ANN WINTERTON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallic 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. During the sixth sitting of the Committee on 26 November the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) raised a point of order challenging my opening comment when I stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the hon. Gentleman—
	<br><blockquote><p>"started by suggesting that the police or another public body can put pressure on witnesses".—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 26 November 1996; c. 235.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman's point of order was made before I had the opportunity to say that he had widened his comments on witness intimidation in a way with which I agreed. You rejected the hon. Gentleman's point of order, Mrs. Winterton, but I responded by saying that I would check 	<i>Hansard</i> and that if I was wrong I would apologise because I would not wish knowingly to make an unjustified statement. I have checked 	<i>Hanard</i> and draw attention to two of the hon. Gentleman's statements: if
	<br><blockquote><p>"that person gives evidence that"</p></blockquote>
causes a conviction
	<br><blockquote><p>"but later admits that he was in the pay of the police"</p></blockquote>
and, secondly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where a political element may have let a conviction remain".—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 26 November 1996; c. 232.]</p></blockquote>
On that basis, Mrs. Winterton, I make no apology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that you are as aware as I am that that is an equally spurious point of order. It is now even Stevens and we should proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Winterton. The hon. Gentleman not only made a spurious point of order but attempted to rewrite 	<i>Hansard.</i> If someone is in the pay of the police as a supergrass, there is no question of intimidation. If someone is bought and sold, he is not intimidated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to a political agenda when an appeal was not allowed because it was not in the interest of the Secretary of State to do so. I was making the point that the Secretary of State should be taken out of the process and that an independent body should be the arbiter of final appeals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As you have made your point, Mr. Connarty, we should get on with our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs Winterton. It may assist the Committee to know that we do not intend to sit this afternoon. It has also come to my notice that the Moderator's service will take place at 11.30 am next Tuesday. It is traditional for Scottish Members of Parliament to be free to attend the service and I believe that most do so. I think it would be reasonable for the Committee to rise at 11.15 am that morning and I have discussed that with the official channels. We shall meet again at 4.30 on Tuesday afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that members of the Committee have taken note of that and will turn up in force and that there will be a full house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>SCOTTISH PRISONERS EARLY RELEASE PANEL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>	<ol>	<li>"—(1) There shall be a panel, to be known as the Scottish Prisoners Early Release Panel, which shall have the principal functions of determining appeals about the decisions of local visiting committees to withhold early release days.</li>
	<li> The panel shall consist of:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>a chairman: and</li>
	<li>not fewer than 6 nor more than 9 other members, appointed by the Secretary of State.</li></ol>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 149 adds a definition of the term "prescribed" to subsection 4 of clause 27, which will apply throughout the chapter on early release. I suspect that the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) may wish to speak to the amendments tabled in his name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall address the points raised by a number of amendments, commencing with amendment No. 126. I am aware that the issue of early release will be extensively debated in relation to clause 28. However, the amendment raises matters that affect the process of early release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received representations from the Association of Directors of Social Work, the Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and the Law Society of Scotland on this issue. Amendment No. 126 would establish a Scottish prisoners early release panel to examine the issue of early release because we have grave doubts about whether the process outlined in the Bill will be practical or fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would implement a change from the independent external parole board system to a prison-based system, but can such a prison-based system operate effectively without creating any additional tensions in the system? Scottish prisons are already overcrowded; the prison population numbers about 6,000. If a prison-based system were introduced, allowing 12 days' early release in any two-month period—half of that for prisoners taking part in education, counselling and pre-release programmes, and half for good behaviour—it could result in significant tensions as prison staff will carry out the assessments. That will demand a degree of objectivity, which may not be possible at all times. The consistency of judgment that will be required of what the Bill describes as a "prescribed person" will be severe. But there is no doubt that judgments will vary considerably, depending on the personnel involved, their knowledge of the inmate and their relationship with him. It will be impossible to persuade prisoners that such a system is fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
The proposal is also unfair on prison staff, who currently act in a certain capacity and have a specific relationship with prisoners. If we give them another role, in which prison staff have what prisoners will perceive as extra power over them, in terms of the number of early release days that prisoners can accumulate, that will lead to tension in prisons. In addition, it would require an enormous administrative system to be set up. The scale of the system, the objectivity of assessments and the intervals at which assessments will be repeated will increase bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, how will the system be linked to prison programmes and to programmes run by outside agencies? At present, the system has to be evaluated in a systematic way. That is a good system, which we are about to throw overboard in haste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland has also commented on the idea of the assessment being carried out by an independent person. It suggested that the person who will grant early release days to prisoners should be independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to set such a proposal within the framework of independent adjudication—that will ensure that prison discipline will not be affected adversely. It is inappropriate for a prisoner's early release to be determined by individuals who are not independent of the prison system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insufficient time has passed since the implementation of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993—which we debated earlier and which came into effect on 31 October 1993—to enable us to evaluate whether that Act deals with the matter effectively. A negative impact on prisoner behaviour is a real possibility. The Government must resolve that matter before the clause is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 128 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Prescribed minimum standard' means an absence of misconduct report".</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders discussed the proposal with us. It said that good behaviour should be the minimum standard required of all prisoners. The absence of a misconduct report should be all that can reasonably be expected of most prisoners, especially in view of the patchy availability of programmes, education schemes and work in the prison estate. The ability of the Scottish prison service to offer all prisoners the opportunity to participate in programmes that are designed to address offending behaviour is questionable because of the high number of prisoners in Scottish prisons. Any extension of the programmes that currently exist would require significant additional resources. However, in view of Tuesday's Budget and the block grant in Scotland, it is not clear that the necessary resources will be available. However, we shall discuss that matter later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's consultation paper, "Making the Punishment Fit the Crime", states that a prisoner's behaviour should be measured over a reasonable period such that it is demonstrated that his behaviour is sufficiently "good to merit reward". However, considerable difficulties attach to such a measurement.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
Requiring prisoners to participate in programmes that are meant to correct offending behaviour might mean that prisoners participate in them for the wrong reasons, thereby wasting limited and valuable resources. For that approach to be effective, it must be linked to the continuation of opportunities in the community, but those linkages are currently inadequate. Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons in Scotland, Clive Fairweather, has already criticised the absence of follow-on programmes for sex offenders on release, and similar difficulties exist in relation to the programmes for drug abusers. The Government are introducing mandatory drug testing in prisons, but the follow-on programmes do not exist, which means that valuable time and resources are wasted and that work is being dissipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 6 fleshes out what the functions of the Scottish prisoners early release panel should be. It states that that panel should determine
	<br><blockquote><p>"appeals about the decisions of local visiting committees to withhold early release days."</p></blockquote>
It also states that the panel should consist of
	<br><blockquote><p>"a chairman … and … not fewer than 6 nor more than 9 other members, appointed by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In making appointments, the Secretary of State shall have regard to the desirability of securing that members of the panel have expertise or knowledge of … community safety … resettlement and rehabilitation of offenders; and … re-offending and recidivism."</p></blockquote>
It is important that the new clause deals with recidivism. Resources are wasted, especially in the age range between 16 and 25, where there is a horrendous rate of recidivism: it is currently around 80 per cent. Those young people are not affected by prison programmes. They are more dangerous when they leave prison than when they went in, which represents a real danger to public safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grave concerns have been expressed about the fact that the processes in the Bill are not objective and about whether a prison-based system will be effective. With that in mind, it is important to have an independent forum—the Scottish prisoners early release panel would provide such a focus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practicalities of the Government's proposals are enormous. For example, to assess the eligibility for release of an estimated 40,000 prisoners is a huge challenge. To give responsibility to visiting committees for the initial assessment in respect of early release would be more efficient and would save money too. The proposed panel would hear subsequent appeals against the visiting committee's decisions. That would streamline the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What additional resources will be made available to the voluntary sector to enable the provision of an effective aftercare service? That is where the system falls down time and again. At present, every prisoner has the right to request voluntary aftercare from the social work department. Some local authorities fulfil that responsibility by funding independent agencies such as SACRO to provide certain services such as information, assistance and daytime activities. If the
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
number of prisoners increases significantly, organisations will be extremely unlikely to be able to discharge that responsibility unless an increase in resources is achieved. We need to take seriously the role of agencies involved in resettlement if we are to reduce offending and recidivism and cut down on the revolving door of the prison system and the cycle of offending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are tabled, first, for simplicity, secondly, for public safety and, thirdly, for the welfare of those within the prison system and, more importantly, of those in society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hard to understand how the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) could speak to the amendments with a straight face. Opposition Members repeatedly bombard the Govrernment with accusations of setting up quangos, but, on Tuesday last, they suggested the establishment of a quango. Happily, my right hon. Friend the Minister rejected it. Again, today, we have heard proposals for a non-elected body—a quango—to oversee the early release of prisoners. It is nonsense and I ask my right hon. Friend to reject it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we follow the lines set out in the Bill, there will be added respect and status for Scottish prison staff, which is important. I have every confidence that such staff will be able to uphold the law as the Bill anticipates. I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister to stick with the proposals in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) talked about quangos, but I think that he has misunderstood the issue. No one would propose the abolition of all quangos—some of them serve a useful function. What we object to is quangos that are absolutely packed with people appointed by Secretaries of State for political reasons. Our proposal would establish a quango, but we would expect its members to be appointed not because they were failed Tory candidates or Tory business men but because, as new clause 6 suggests, they had specific and relevant expertise. If the hon. Member for Ayr cared to read new clause 6, he would understand precisely what it proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has made a charge against quango members right across the board. Can she give me an example of where a Tory placement—whether of a Tory or a Labour supporter—on a quango has been inappropriate? Can she give me one name?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect, Mrs. Winterton, that you would rule me out of order if I started to run through all the health boards in Scotland where people have been appointed—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The characters are so faceless that I cannot remember their names, but if the hon. Member for Ayr wants a list, I shall provide him with one before the week is out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want people to be appointed to the body by Labour or Tory supporters because of their political opinions—they should be appointed for their relevant expertise. I would not care about their political views if they could offer knowledge of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
community safety, resettlement and rehabilitation of offenders, reoffending and recidivism. The key point is that people on such bodies should know what they are talking about. They should not receive a small additional income because they happen to be of the right political opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the amendments, it would be eminently sensible to have a body comprising people with expertise and independent judgment. It would not be fair for a decision about a prisoner to depend on the prison service because views might vary from one prison to another—a request might be turned down in one prison but granted in another in similar circumstances. There would be more chance of decisions being fair and open to public scrutiny if we had an independent body overseeing such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of independence, the Law Society explained that the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 only came into effect on 31 October 1994—just over two years ago—which is a short time in which to determine its effectiveness. All hon. Members must be aware of that and the Minister should tell us what evidence he has of its effectiveness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to the 1993 Act, but the provisions relating to parole came into effect only last May. There has been no time to assess their impact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah, well that makes my argument even stronger. I thought that the authorities had had two years to make an assessment. What is the point of not having enough time to judge whether a law has been effective? If sufficient time had gone by and it was possible to make an objective assessment, we could all see whether it made sense to reform it further or to leave well alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As that Act was based on the Kincraig committee review I expect the Minister to explain why he is casting it aside when there has been no time to discover whether the provisions have been effective. I read the notes on clauses in the hope that I would find an explanation, but there was none. The Minister should tell us why he is pressing on with further amendments when we do not know how well the previous legislation has worked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are clearly on one more political platform. Everyone realises that they are not trying to increase the effectiveness of the prison system—the weak arguments of the Minister in his brief statement, and the hon. Member for Ayr, underlined that. Every organisation consulted on these provisions and those in the 1993 Act wanted more effective control of prisoners after their release. The impression given to the public by the White Paper and the Bill is that when people come out after serving five sixths of their sentence, they have been and will be more effectively controlled and less of a danger to society. But the arguments of three years ago—probably made in this Room—were that it was more effective for people to serve half their sentence in prison and then suspend the second half while they are
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
out of prison, during which time they are liable to be returned to prison immediately if they breach the conditions of their parole. We were five weeks into the operation of that Act—it takes a long time to bring such measures into operation—when the Government introduced this Bill. They are throwing out every piece of logic that they originally applied. Their political prejudices lead them to hope that an act of populism may gain them votes at the election—but the public know what the Government are trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 16.5 of the Government's White Paper spells out the financial implications of the one-sixth-sentence proposal, which might add
	<br><blockquote><p>"10–15 per cent. to the running costs of the Scottish Prison Service".</p></blockquote>
Even using the private finance initiative—the Government's mythological method of constructing public buildings that so far has realised only one contract in England and Wales—the Government's estimate is that the proposal would add £22.8 million to the cost of running the Scottish prisons. It is frightening to be considering this proposal, particularly after a Budget which has led to a reduction of £255 million in the Scottish Office budget as its contribution to the Chancellor's attempt to bring down income tax by 1p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not mentioned what the Scottish Prison Officers Association thinks of the proposal. I have a young offenders' institution in my constituency and I have talked to its SPOA members. They were looking forward to a regime that would lessen the considerable stress under which they work. As the Minister knows, there is so much pressure on male prison accommodation that the Government recently had to move some of the inmates of a young offenders' institution into a wing of the only women's prison in Scotland, and also had to move some of the women who were coming out at the end of their sentences into the training-for-liberty blocks in the young offenders' institution in Polmont in my constituency. There is already immense pressure on the SPOA and yet the burden on its members would increase if they had to assess whether someone should get one sixth of a sentence remitted and be released after having served five sixths of a sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many prisoners, especially young offenders, should be out in the community showing that they can be good citizens, not staying in prison to prove they can be good prisoners. In reality, prisons criminalise further the criminals inside, giving them new access to criminal friends and to criminal behaviours. Nothing that I have seen in Scottish prisons leads me to believe that a period of incarceration creates a better citizen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere does the Bill make provision for extra resources for education or for psychological and psychiatric treatment—the Government have rejected that idea or any other way of reforming prisoners. A prisoner spends five sixths of a sentence learning how to get on with the prison warders and the criminal fraternity with whom he shares a cell and facilities and is then moved out into the public domain. The SPOA does not support the proposal. The Government, however, are not taking anyone's advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
I do not expect either that they will take the advice of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, which argues strongly for our amendments and against the Government's proposal. To put it starkly, that proposal abolishes the parole system, which has long been held up as the method whereby a prisoner can be out of prison and yet still be monitored under supervision to find out whether he can perform as a good citizen. That system was recommended by the Kincraig committee which, in 1991, dealt with parole and related issues in Scotland. It was taken on board by the Government in a sensible and possibly even an enlightened way in the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 and now they have rejected it. It is worth repeating what the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties says on the matter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"once more populism seems to be replacing a rational, considered approach to Scottish criminal justice legislation".</p></blockquote>
That is the charge of which the Government are arraigned. We are proposing that they should go along with the wishes of the SPOA and not force prison officers, who already have a considerable custodial burden placed on them, to have to become judge and jury over whether one of their charges should be released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there will be violence in prisons. Recently, an effective group of young people organised a mini riot in Polmont. They had become quite powerful in the system. To cut the riot off at its source and to isolate those people from the rest of the prisoners required effective action by officers in Polmont.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People with five sixths of their sentences still to serve will have very little incentive for good behaviour, but a lot of incentive to organise what might be called a "cushy number" for themselves by becoming more violent and threatening to other prisoners. Under the proposal, all prisoners will have to serve five sixths of a sentence. Some of them, especially those who should be released much earlier, will have great problems in dealing with the system. Such prisoners might become victims of the pressures resulting from the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will also be pressure on the Scottish Prison Officers Association whose members will find their job much more difficult. They are already under pressure. I have spoken to so many prison officers—especially those who used to serve in Cornton as the suicides mounted—who said, "If I could get a deal, I would get out tomorrow." It was different when I used to live in Cornton, along the road from the prison. Then, the women and male officers who I knew were very enthusiastic about their jobs. Now, officers feel under pressure and that will add massively to their burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government give the impression that the proposal will make prisoners serve the sentences that they were originally given—that would have been no different under the 1993 Act. Offenders would not have served their full sentences in prison, but they would still have had to serve the full sentence under
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
Government constraint and control. The Government do not seem to have given that idea the chance to get off the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Prison Officers Association, the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties and the Law Society of Scotland all oppose the proposal. To leap from one system to another without first recognising the effect of the original system and to do it in such a way as to place the burden back on the prisons is a nonsense. If the Government must go down this crazy road and stand on this crazy, populist platform, they should at least introduce an outside arbiter to take the pressure off the Scottish prison officers who have been given an unfair new role which was not in their original contracts—they are not trained for it and did not sign up for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new role is an added burden and totally unfair. The Government should step back and think seriously about introducing an independent body so that when the one-sixth sentence—a terrible idea—comes up for consideration, it is examined by a body such as the parole board. The parole board is already in place because of the 1993 Act which made it much more important and the Government could use it as we propose—as an independent arbiter. I do not know any prison officers who are biased, but certain prisoners perceive that some are. They believe that prison officers take a dislike to certain prisoners because they do not like their faces and that such prisoners would be unlikely to receive a fair hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in prisons and in young offenders institutions are not the most competent or socially balanced people in society. They do not come from the best homes or necessarily have the social values or the behaviour that would make them attractive candidates for early release. They feel oppressed and become abusive and angry along with all the other traits that come from the pressure of living in a prison. Many of them become victims of other criminals in prison who are tougher, harder and better organised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposals, prisoners will have to be assessed by officers who might be, to use a modern Scottish phrase, "noising up"—who might be causing them problems. Prisoners will be judged by those prison officers which is totally unfair and unrealistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton mentioned SACRO's opinion. No one except the Government supports the measure. In the beginning, I think that the only person who favoured it was the Secretary of State. Because of his deluded way of looking at life, he has to import every English idea to ingratiate himself with the English section of the Conservative party. When he loses his seat in Stirling, he will have to crawl off to England to get a seat. That is what he is worried about, not the Scottish people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall answer the question of the hon. Member for Dumbarton concerning resources to be made available for the voluntary sector for aftercare. We value the role of organisations such as APEX and SACRO with whom the Scottish prison service will continue to work closely. As the parole system winds down, resources will become available both for those subject to the new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
supervised release orders and those ex-prisoners who voluntarily seek support on release. The impact of the new proposals will not be immediate, which will give time to assess and adjust the resources available for such work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with who should award early release days and who should assess such awards. New clause 6 would provide for visiting committees to assess entitlement to early release. Visiting committees are long-established institutions, dating back to the 19th century; their function is to act as an independent watchdog, monitoring the operation of prisons and conditions for prisoners. That would not sit easily with the role of assessing prisoners' behaviour, and it is significant that when the parole system was introduced in 1968 the function of assessing applications locally was not given to them, but instead a new body was created—the local review committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 126 envisages that a new specialist body—the Scottish prisoners early release panel—would make awards under the new scheme. It is therefore inconsistent with new clause 6, which would give the proposed panel a different function—that of determining appeals when the visiting committees decide to withhold early release days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment may be a little furry at the edges, but its thrust is to ensure an independent assessment. A process that has been successful for years will be taken away and a subjective scheme will be implemented. We do not know who the "independent" prescribed person will be—that is dangerous and I ask the Minister to address himself to that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be an independent element. For example, a prison will be able to appeal to an independent person—a Scottish prisons complaints commissioner. It is proposed that a provision to that effect will be included in prison rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is correct in that amendments Nos. 152, 154 and 156 seek to make the award of days of early release a function of an "independent" prescribed person, leaving it to prison rules to specify who he or she will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Early release under the new scheme must be earned by good behaviour in prison. That is why in our view no outside body can realistically be expected to make awards of days of early release. Even if the function were given to them, they would be reliant on reports from prison staff. It is clear that prison staff are best placed to make the individual assessments under the new scheme. They work with the prisoners on a day-to-day basis and have the professional expertise to judge the progress made by each prisoner. The process would be prescribed in the prison rules, which will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. But let me say now that assessments will not be made on the whim of one individual officer. We envisage that the governor or another senior manager will convene an assessment
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
board to consider carefully reports from relevant staff on each prisoner, according to a range of criteria which would be set out in prison rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened closely to what the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) said and it is only fair to state that one of the responses came from the trade union side of the Scottish prison service. It was made clear that the responses are not confidential and are subject to access if anyone wishes to see them. It states under item 3 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the best qualified people to decide upon early release should be those working closest with the prisoner. The best method of achieving this would be the formation of some sort of local Early Release Board, which would consider input from various sources, ie Gallery Officer, Party Officer and any specialists who are involved with the prisoner in any form of training or counselling group."</p></blockquote>
That is what we are seeking to do—to amend the prison rules and to set up the necessary assessment board in accordance with the representations of the Scottish prison service trade union side.

With regard to the avenue for appeals—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the trade union side expressed that opinion, was it aware of the proposal in new clause 6? It might have expressed a preference in ignorance of another resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Its letter was dated 12 March 1996. I do not know whether the relevant possibility had been put to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the avenue for appeals against decisions, that, too, will be specified in detail in the prison rules. In addition, prisoners may make use of the prison complaints procedure, which includes making an appeal to an independent person—the Scottish prison complaints commissioner. That is how independence is included in the system. The system will provide for expert assessment and independent appeals, and on that basis I see no need to establish the additional body proposed in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give way to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), who has previously called for the abolition of quangos. It is interesting that he is now, I suspect, about to call for the creation of one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Actually, I wanted to ask the Minister a question.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It specifically said that those working closest with the prisoner should be involved. The independent element, which I recommend to the Committee, involves an appeal to an independent person, namely the Scottish prison complaints commissioner, which will be a substantial safeguard.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
In conclusion, our position is that no one outwith the Scottish prison service will be in a position to make the necessary assessment of the prisoner's behaviour on which the initial award of days of early release depends. We accept the case for independent scrutiny where there is a complaint about the manner in which the initial award was made. That will be built into the system with the involvement of the Scottish prison complaints commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore urge the Committee to reject all the amendments except for the Government amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to make a small speech because the Minister was reluctant to answer the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sit on the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. I believe that the relevant ombudsman oversees the responsibilities of the Scottish prison complaints commissioner and he has remarked that calling the prison complaints commissioner in England an ombudsman is totally inaccurate because he is not independent, as is the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. Prison complaints commissioners are not really independent ombudsmen in the prison system in England and Wales because they can be sacked and, as we saw earlier, were sacked for not agreeing with the Home Secretary. A similar conflict has not arisen in Scotland, but it could because, unlike the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the Scottish prison complaints commissioner's writ does not run as far as we should wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the prison complaints commissioner be able to overrule the board and say that a person should be released?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that he can overrule the local appeals panel is interesting. Will the local appeals panel or someone from the prison system be able to go above the prison complaints commissioner, or does the process end with the prison complaints commissioner? That would substantially increase the prison complaints commissioner's present powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the prison complaints commissioner have access to all information and documents relating to a prisoner's case, including correspondence with the Secretary of State or any other Minister in the Scottish Office who has been involved in the case? Will the prison complaints commissioner's role and remit be rewritten and publicised because of concerns expressed in the Select Committee? In fact, only yesterday, we interrogated the commissioner, Sir William Reid, about the fact that many people are not aware of the codes of complaint. Throughout the health service and Government Departments, there is still a low level of knowledge about them. What safeguards will there be for prisoners to ensure that they, their representatives and relatives have all the facts about their rights under the new procedure? Will the Government produce new leaflets or run a campaign because, according to Sir William Reid, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration,
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
they have been poor in publicising the code of open government in Government Departments and the health service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not usually a suspicious person. In fact, if I have fault, it is that I believe what I am told. But I became suspicious as I listened to the Minister trying to justify rejecting the amendments. He said that the purpose of the clause was to ensure good behaviour in prisons, that early release for good behaviour had to be properly earned and that no outside body was qualified to judge whether early release should be granted. But what really struck me about the Minister's explanation was that the system that is being set up to judge whether prisoners have earned early release is entirely under the control of Ministers. How the system should be set up is to be written into the prison rules. Who is to write it into the prison rules? Ministers. Who is to sit on the assessment board that will examine individual cases and decide whether prisoners should have early release? It is to be the governor or senior managers, who are direct appointees of the Minister, accountable directly to the Minister and completely under the Minister's control. He said that the prisoners' interests would be looked after by prison complaints commissioners but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East emphasised, those commissioners are appointed by the Minister, directly accountable to the Minister and directly under his control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is creating a system for early release from Scottish prisons that is dominated by the Secretary of State for Scotland. I am suspicious because I do not believe that the Minister is the least bit concerned about whether prisoners earn early release through good behaviour. I believe that his main concern can be seen in the White Paper, which explains that the reason for introducing changes to the system of early release is to make the time served in prison match more closely the sentence passed by the court. The intention of the system is to deny early release to prisoners because the Government want prisoners to spend more time in prison. That is why, in the financial memorandum to the Bill, the Government, who hate public spending and who exist to try to bring public spending below 40 per cent, of GDP, say that the provisions will cost up to £100 million a year extra in public spending. Why are the Government prepared to increase public spending in that area? Because they have the political motivation to look tough and to appear to be dealing harshly with prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That attitude is wrong headed and will lead to serious tensions inside prisons. Prisoners are not stupid. They closely watch what happens to prison regulations and the impact that changes to regulations have on them. They will see that the Government are creating a system that is designed to make them spend more time in prison, even at the cost of greater public expense for all the taxpayers outside prison, and they will not like it. They will like even less the fact that they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
will be completely at the mercy of individual prison warders, who will decide whether they have earned the 12 days in every two months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that early release must be earned. But he is creating a system that will encourage the old lags—the people who know how to do time—to appear to attend programmes and to appear to cooperate in order to earn the maximum amount of early release days. But that will not change prisoners' behaviour. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East was absolutely right when he said that the prison system should prepare people to go back into the community and not to reoffend. The proposals make that far less likely to happen. Why is the Minister reluctant to allow an independent element to judge whether prisoners are entitled to early release? I suspect that he does not like independent elements because they do not come under his political control. The Government have a political objective: they are determined to make people spend longer periods in prison, which will increase tension—and possibly violence—in prisons and lead to a deterioration in the relationship between prison warders and prisoners. No one in his right mind supports the early clauses and the Minister has made a poor job of trying to persuade us otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish merely to ask the Minister—he did not answer this earlier—why he is moving so rapidly when there has not been enough time to consider the outcome of the Kincraig review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I missed the last part of the sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been only a short time since the recommendations of the Kincraig review were put into effect, but the Minister is making more changes. Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question has been answered many times. We tightened the provisions dealing with early release but we did not go far enough, and further protections for the public need to be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the question asked by the hon. Member for Dundee, East, the reason good behaviour should be rewarded by early release—and bad behaviour should not—is well illustrated by my visit to Shotts prison after a riot seven or eight years ago. A hammer was thrown at a prison officer in one of the halls when his back was turned, and it became embedded in the wall. When he turned around, eight to 10 people were sitting at a table but he had no idea who had thrown it. He was not going to trust all of them, so they were all penalised. It is appropriate that good behaviour should be rewarded and bad behaviour should lead to loss of days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be suggesting that the system for early release from prison is being abused and that prisoners are not earning early release under the existing regime. He should bring evidence of that before the Committee. However, he has not presented one scrap of evidence that the system is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
working effectively and that prisoners are being released who have not earnt an early release. Until he does so he should not moralise and lecture members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying clearly that early release is justified where there is good behaviour, but we believe that additional protections should be afforded to the public. Prisoners should not expect automatic release when they have served half a sentence as a matter of right. That is what we are trying to correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East asked whether the complaints commissioner will get all the documents. The answer is yes, but the detailed procedure for appeals will be set out in the rules. Whether that will be the end of the matter will depend on whether the rules and procedures are correctly followed. Prisoners sometimes take legal action against the Scottish prison service if they think that powers have been exceeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for how a prisoner appeals against an assessment, the White Paper explains that the procedures will be set out in the prison rules which will form the basis of the avenue of appeal. The current procedure involving the independent Scottish prisoners complaints commissioner was introduced in 1994 and revised in February this year. The procedure will be abbreviated for use in the new context. Prisoners will first have to submit a written complaint to the internal complaints committee, which is chaired by a senior prison manager and has at least three members. In presenting his case to the committee, the prisoner will be able to seek the assessment of a member of staff or another individual connected with the prison who may attend the committee hearing. The hearing will be held within seven days of a complaint being made. The complaints committee will make a decision on the case within two days of the hearing. If a complaint is upheld, the committee will advise the governor in charge on the action to be taken. The governor is expected to accept that advice and to act accordingly. If the complaint is not upheld, the prisoner may appeal in writing to the governor in charge. If the prisoner is not happy with the final response received at local level, he may appeal to the Scottish prison complaints commissioner, who is independent of the Scottish prison service. His decision can be substituted for that of the governor. That sums up the system that would ensure substantial safeguards for the prisoner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mrs. Winterton, for having to make a further contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister can take it for granted that no member of the Committee is in favour of prisoners rioting or of people getting out of prison who should be in prison because of bad behaviour. However, we have asked him repeatedly why it is necessary to change things so soon after the current arrangements were put into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
effect. He has said that they are unsatisfactory, but I appeal to you, Mrs. Winterton, and ask whether it is reasonable for the Committee to act on the Minister's statement that he merely finds the arrangements unsatisfactory without us hearing evidence as to why. As members of the Committee, we are trying to discuss changes in the law and at least half of us have not seen anything to support the Minister's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The Minister forces me to my feet because I must ask him whether he has any shame at all. He will dance; he will jump; he will have a political voice transplant—anything to suit the mask that he has to wear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three short years ago the same individual sat opposite me and said that the Government wished to introduce a system whereby individuals were released having served half a sentence. They would then be supervised in the community for the duration of the second half of their sentence and, if they reoffended, they would be brought back to prison. When the Government made that proposal, the hon. Member for Ayr supported it. We accepted the Minister's statements. The Minister said that, under the system, those who were released from prison would be properly supervised. They were not just going to get out, be unsupervised, reoffend and have to come back to serve their full sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave Shotts Prison as an example. Nothing in the proposal will ensure that a prisoner will be targeted and the new system will be better. Only one prisoner was responsible, but all eight lost their remission. The result will be more tension. We do not condone prisoners who misbehave: they should still be in prison.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can sum up briefly on the subject. My attitude has not changed and is quite clear. Although the Bill goes beyond the 1993 Act, that Act was a step in the right direction. I remind the Committee of my comments during discussion of that Act, which I said would
	<br><blockquote><p>"strengthen the deterrent effect of long sentences. Offenders sentenced to four or more years will have to wait until they have served as least half their sentence before being considered for parole, instead of one-third as at present … the Bill restores the meaning to the full duration of a long sentence ensuring that release, when it comes, will be on licence, with a liability to recall for breach of licence. It also makes all released prisoners subject to recall by order of the court should they commit a futher offence punishable by imprisonment during the outstanding part of the sentence."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 19 October 1992; Vol. 212, c. 289.]</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asks on what evidence. The answer is a source that is not unduly friendly to the Government, or known for supporting us. Ninety-three per cent, of responses to the 	<i>Daily Record</i> poll favoured honesty in sentencing. Opposition Members cannot have it both ways: they cannot say that they wholeheartedly approve of the 	<i>Daily Record</i> when it suits their cause but then disapprove of it when it holds a poll that provides 93 per cent. support for our proposal. We believe that it is absolutely necessary to put in place much stronger protections for the public and we are doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 28 is the one that we most want to debate this morning. I am worried that the lack of parole provisions apply to all sentences, including those of less than three months. I have examined paragraph 9(2) of schedule 1, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In section 1 (release of prisoners)… subsections (1) to (3) and (8) shall cease to have effect".</p></blockquote>
It seems that that will apply to those who have spent less than three months in prison. With that in mind, we tabled amendment No. 158, which would insert into the Bill the phrase "exceeding three months".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was mentioned earlier, prison overcrowding is relevant to the matter. About 83 per cent. of prisoners in Scottish prisons are there for less than six months. If the proposals are applied to those serving less than three months, that will put increased pressure on prisons and several anomolies will be thrown up. What does the Minister think about the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals are absurd because someone with an 11-week sentence could be released after 11 weeks, but someone with a 12-week sentence could be released after nine weeks and three days. Our proposals, which would re-introduce consistency, would mean that a person with an 11-week sentence would be released after seven weeks and two days, a person with a 12-week sentence would be released after eight weeks and a person with a 13-week sentence would be released after 10 weeks and two days. Our proposals involve an element of progression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By abolishing the current early release arrangements for all prisoners serving less than three months, the Bill will double the sentence to be served by prisoners, which will have a significant effect on the size of the prison population. For example, according to Scottish Office prison statistics for 1994, which were published in October 1995, 2,356 prisoners—20 per cent. of receptions into prisons—received a sentence of less than three months. If the Government's proposals are applied to the 1994 figures, an additional 291 prisoner places would be required at a total cost of more than £3.9 million—and that takes account only of sentences of less than three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals will also adversely affect 8,875 fine defaulters who were sent to prison in 1994 with an average custody of 11 days. They will lose all remission, which will require an extra 262 prisoner places a year at a cost of just over £3.5 million. According to the Government's proposals, therefore, if the 1994 figures incorporated people serving less than three months and fine defaulters, the total number of extra prison places would be raised to 553 and would involve and extra cost of almost £7.5 million. I have the precise figures to hand if the Minister wants to see them. That extra expense would cover only those with sentences of less than three months and fine defaulters. Is that what the Government intend? Is that how they want to spend an extra £7.5 million? Where will the money come from? We shall discuss later the relevant Budget proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would award additional days for breaches of discipline on terms similar to those in the 1993 Act, which would give shorter-term prisoners the necessary incentive for good behaviour. We also
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
believe that conditions for remission for prisoners serving up to three months should be toughened up—release should be after two thirds of sentence, rather than the current rate of one half. That would return the situation to what it was before the 1993 Act came into force. I look forward to hearing the Minister's views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would introduce a system of automatic early release of one third of sentence for prisoners serving three months or less. We oppose automatic early release—we should like it to be earned. We also consider that one third of sentence is too generous a margin of early release which risks undermining public confidence in sentencing. There are sound practical reasons for not applying earned early release to those serving less than three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear to the Committee that we are in favour of expanding community service orders and supervised attendance orders throughout Scotland as alternatives to imprisonment for minor offences. For those who are sent to prison, the assessment of prisoners' behaviour against any standard is required to take place over a period of time. While the selection of an appropriate period requires the exercise of judgment, we consider that two months is an appropriate period during which assessments may be made. At the end of the first two-month period, 12 days early release will be available to be awarded and clearly it would be impractical, given the time needed to conduct the assessment and make the arrangements necessary for release, to deduct that from a sentence of less than around two and a half months. The lowest convenient threshold above which it makes sense, therefore, to conduct assessments is three months, and that is the threshold which we have selected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are I think correct in their assumption that for such short-term offenders it is impracticable to operate any system of earned early release. But I cannot agree that we should therefore provide for their automatic release after two thirds of sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that under the Government's proposals for sentences of 11 weeks, the prisoner will be released after 11 weeks because there will be no remission, but someone who receives a sentence of 12 weeks could be released after nine weeks and three days? An offender who is sentenced to serve an extra week may serve a shorter time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall examine that and write to the hon. Gentleman, but we believe that the automatic early release for which he is calling would not have the necessary deterrent effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that it costs the prison service £7.5 million for the imprisonment of people serving less than three months? Can he think of better ways of spending the proportion of that sum that would be saved by accepting new clause 9?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause refers to contempt of court and nonpayment of fines. How many cases of contempt of court involve people who have been frightened to give evidence following threats from the accused and how
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
often does the contempt arise from disrespectful behaviour in court? I have no idea what sort of sentence someone might receive in either of those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we all agree that people should not be imprisoned for fine default and that other ways should be found to resolve the problem. The Secretary of State said that fine defaulters should not be in prison and if the Minister agrees with that principle, how can he object to reducing the time spent in prison? He has already accepted that such sentences are too short for prisoners to be able to demonstrate good behaviour meriting curtailment of sentence. There are sensible reasons for accepting the new clause. People should not be in prison because they are merely fine defaulters. Other ways can be found to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about contempt of court. That may involve true contempt in the sense that someone refuses to carry out his civic duty, or it may be a refusal to carry out that civic duty for fear of the consequences. What sort of sentences might result in either case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Contempt of court is appealable, but it is not a frequent disposal. It must be serious contempt before a sentence of imprisonment is imposed. I remember one case in which the accused threatened to inflict serious injury on the judge when he emerged from prison; he was sentenced to three months, but that sentence was reduced on appeal. That is an important consideration, and I do not believe it would be a proper disposal for anyone carrying out his civic duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) suggested that 83 per cent. of prisoners were in prison for less than six months. It is true that such prisoners form a substantial proportion of receptions, but, because their stay is short, they do not have a great impact on the prison population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our rough calculations suggest that prisoners serving three months or less represent 45 per cent. of receptions and 5 per cent. of the daily population. However, I must stress that courts are strongly recommended to consider the disposals of community service orders and supervised attendance orders and to apply them wherever appropriate, as we prefer minor offenders not to be imprisoned but to carry out services for the community, which are of greater benefit to the community and to the offenders themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be considered anomalous that a person serving three months can spend less time in prison than one serving just less than three months. We are prepared to consider that point. When the hon. Gentleman asked me about that, I did not give him an answer off the top of my head because I wanted to consider it further, and I now believe that the hon. Gentleman may have a good point. I shall investigate that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for the record, so that we understand the implications of the Government's proposals, according to their own records, in 1995, about 3,891 prisoners were received into prisons to serve sentences of less than three months. Has the Minister's Department calculated the number of additional days that those prisoners will serve, and what the cost will be to the public purse as a direct result of the Minister's refusal to accept the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly work out what it is likely to be and let the hon. Gentleman know. But I must stress that such matters cannot be calculated exactly because decisions of the courts cannot be anticipated. As I have made clear to the hon. Gentleman, I am in favour of the courts considering alternatives to imprisonment for minor offences. To give an example, a girl I met recently, who was carrying out a supervised attendance order, had failed to pay her television licence. In my view, it would have been quite wrong to send her to prison when another disposal was more valuable to the community and to the offender. In that case, a supervised attendance order was appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East made a very good point in asking the Minister whether he had costed the proposals. Perhaps they have been costed and the information resides in the Scottish Office, but the Opposition have considered the figures in the 1994 prison statistics publication. I do not want to bore the Minister, but it is important that he considers what we have to say and tries to refute it. The combined cost of those in custody and those in prison for fine default will take from the public purse about £7.5 million, which we have calculated in the following way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1994 report says that those who served less than 30 days comprised 305 prison receptions. They were in prison for an actual or assumed period of 15 days, which comes to a total of 4,575 days. Those in prison for 30 days comprised 596 prison receptions. They were in prison for an actual or assumed period of 30 days, which makes a total of 17,880 days. Those in prison for 31 to 59 days comprised 89 prison receptions. They were in prison for an actual or assumed period of 45 days. Therefore, the total number of days for that category was 4,005. Those who served 60 days comprised 1,341 prison receptions. They were in prison for 60 actual or assumed days, which gives a total of 80,460 days. Those in for 61 to 89 days comprised 25 prison receptions multiplied by 70 actual or assumed days, which gives a total of 1,750 days. If we add up those five categories we have a total of 108,670 days or 292 years. The reason for calculating years is because it costs about £26,500 to keep a prisoner in prison in Scotland for one year. If we multiply £26,500 by 292, we have a total of £7.887 million. As half of that has already been costed because of the current parole system, the additional cost to the Government for the custodies will be half of that figure: £3.94 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
Next, I shall calculate the cost of those sentenced for fine defaults. The 1994 statistics report showed that prison receptions for 8,875 fine defaulters were for an average stay of 11 days. That makes a total of 97,625 days or 262 years. Multiply that sum by the £26,500 it costs to keep a prisoner for a year and we have a total of £7.074 million. However, as half has already been costed, that sum should be halved to £3.5 million. If we add £3.5 million to £3.94 million, we have a total of about £7.4 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Opposition can make such a calculation why cannot the Government, with their litany of civil servants, do the same? Has the Minister allowed for that £7.4 million? Is that money ready? Is the proposal just rhetoric or does it have substance? It is disgraceful that the Government cannot produce those figures but the Opposition, with our lack of resources, can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to give some figures. However, I preface my remarks by saying that it would be inappropriate to ask judges to sentence according to the prison places available. It is the Government's duty to make provision to accommodate the disposals of the courts and that is what we shall do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that our estimates are realistic and allow for the possibility that courts will not adjust sentences downwards under honesty in sentencing. If they do not, the prison population might increase by about 1,000 in the first year after implementation, with the increase rising to about 2,200 in the fifth year. The cost, as indicated in the financial memorandum, would be about £65 million per annum. To accommodate such an increase, up to five additional prisons will be needed and will be provided under the private finance initiative. The Scottish prison service is planning ahead to accommodate whatever scenario may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The estimates assume that prisoners will earn, on average, half of the early release available to them. I can only say that the Government are committed to provide the places necessary to meet the disposals of the courts. The running cost of the Scottish prison service is currently £152 million per year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the Minister said that a three-month sentence for contempt of court or for failure to pay a fine was fairly rare. Could he give examples of contempts of courts or refusals or failures to pay fines that have resulted in a three-month sentence? If he cannot, why is he opposing new clause 9? If such a case is so rare that he cannot give us an example of how serious such an offence might have been in a real Scottish court, frankly I wonder what we are talking about this morning. If it is rare to impose that length of sentence why will he not accept the new clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point arises from the Minister's remarks a moment ago. If he is proposing to build yet more prisons, has he considered the fact that, out of all European countries, Scotland has the highest proportion of its population in prison?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were a matter of confining people to prison who were a danger to society we would not have an argument, but we are talking about fine defaulters and people who have committed contempt of court whose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
slight early release would not, in the vast majority of cases, pose a danger. What is the sense in locking up all those people at enormous epublic expense when other disposals would be more appropriate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered many of the hon. Lady's questions. In the matter of contempt of court, I gave the example of an accused person who, after threatening a judge, was given a three-month sentence for contempt of court which was quashed on appeal. A more likely example is that of a key witness in a serious criminal case who, failing to turn up to give evidence, is judged to be in contempt of court and made to spend a night in gaol beforehand. That is not a usual disposal and I do not believe that there is a case for the provisions. Contempt of court is invoked only in extreme circumstances. There will be outbursts when people are convicted and sentenced because that is a difficult moment for them and their families. Such outbursts generally pass without comment, but occasionally, when threats are made, a judge might impose a sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree that someone who fails to give evidence in court in order to protect a criminal should be dealt with pretty toughly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If someone gives false evidence that is perjury and they can be proceeded against on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether it is refusal to give evidence or perjury, it is wrong for someone to conspire with a defendant in the hope that he will get away with his crime. The Minister has not responded to my point about how frequently someone might serve a sentence of three months for a fine default.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was dealt with in the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990 which introduced supervisee-attendance orders. We are providing funds to extend that scheme throughout Scotland so that those who might have gone to prison for fine default will not have to do so. There will be a much more appropriate disposal outwith prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that resources will be provided to cope with the effects of the Bill. I must apologise for my earlier calculation of £22.8 million. It turns out that the correct figure is £22.8 million for every 500 prisoners. The Government have calculated that 1,000 extra places will be required within a year, which means that £45.6 million will be needed for the first year even under the PFI, which the Government tell us is cheaper than providing funds directly from the public sector. A total of £100.32 million will be needed by the fifth year when the Government's 2,200 new places are created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given how the public sector operates in Scotland, trying to get finance out of the Government for anything that the public need or desire is incredible because they are unwilling to fund public services. Is the Minister saying that £100 million of new money will be found for the Scottish Office? Or is it the case,
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
as we and the public suspect, that the £100 Million spent on new places will be taken from the health service or local authority services such as education or another part of the Scottish Office budget? If the money is not taken from other services, that will go against the trend of all the Secretary of State's expenditure plans and those of his colleagues over the past decade and a half. During the 1980s I served in local government, as did many other members of the Committee, and I watched the Government slash local authority budgets year on year. They also capped the ability of local authorities to raise funds by local taxation, thereby necessitating cuts in service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from a contact of mine that the Secretary of State's local education authority faces a cut of £2 million in its budget for the coming year. That cut was made because the Government underfunded local government reorganisation by over £200 million and because of their general approach to the funding of local authorities. However, the Minister said that he will spend £100 million on prison places. Will that be new money? How will we know if it is? Will it be ringfenced? Will the Treasury give it directly to the Scottish Office without cuts being made in other services; or, as we suspect, will the Government slash and burn local government services and the Scottish health service? Are they indulging their manic obsession with the incarceration of prisoners in the belief that that keeps down crime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes to which question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am glad to answer the hon. Gentleman's question. The estimates of prison places include a 15 per cent. reduction due to the incapacitation effect—if people spend longer in prison they will not be given their liberty, and there will therefore be a fall in the number of offences committed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister said that he does not want to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A person cannot commit a crime if he is in prison. It is impossible to say at this stage where the funding will come from—it depends on spending priorities at the time of implementation. However, we made it clear that that cannot be done until additional prison places are available, which will be around 2000. A significant sum is involved, but it should be remembered that even the highest figure to which I referred—£100 million—represents less than 1 per cent. of the Scottish Office's total planned block spending for this year: I believe that it represents about about 0·7 per cent. of that spending. The matter cannot be predicted exactly because we do not know precisely what the disposals of the courts will be, which, in turn, depend on the circumstances of the crime committed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is accompanied by officials who supply him with information, will he tell us how many additional police officers could be put on the beat if that were financed by the £44 million that is allocated for year one and the £100 million that is allocated for year five? How effective in terms of the Government and police officers of Scotland think that putting that number of policemen on the street would be in cutting crime? Would not it be better to spend the £100 million on policing and on stopping crime rather than on slamming people in goal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very large proportion of the £100 million will in any case be spent on prisons. The police, who are at the sharp end of the problem, support the Bill's proposals. If someone is a considerable danger to the community, it is obviously not in the police's interests to release that person before he ceases being a considerable danger to the community. I hope that the committee will not accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make a quick response to the incredible comment that the Minister made about what he called the incapacitation effect, which states that if prisoners are kept in prison longer, that will prevent them from offending when they are released. I am not sure whether the right hon. Gentleman realised what he was saying. He has described to the Committee a system that has failure built into it—it guarantees that when prisoners are released, they will re-offend. The Government assume that they will do so—they have made allowance for that in their expenditure plans. They are making no attempt to cure prisoners of their offending habit. The whole tenet of the Bill is to assume that prisoners will re-offend when they are released. There are no proposals in the Bill that attempt to change prisoners' behaviour while they are in prison. That is the weakness of the Government's approach to penal issues and it lies behind their gross failure to do anything about the rising level of crime in the past 17 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that £100 million is only 1 per cent. of the Scottish Office budget. I spent a brief period on the Opposition Front Bench and if I had dared to make a £100 million commitment for an incoming Labour Government, every Conservative Member would have stood up and asked where the money was coming from—whether it was coming from higher taxes or another budget. Yet when the Government make a commitment they simply say that it is only 1 per cent. of the Scottish Office budget and that it will be found from somewhere and it does not matter where. I cannot say what I think about the Government because it would be unparliamentary, but people outside know them for what they are and when they face the people at the general election they will be found wanting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I take it that the Minister will consider the proposal concerning the 11 weeks? It is plainly absurd and shows the Government's lack of thought and clarity. If someone is sentenced to 11 weeks, he will serve 11 weeks, but if he is sentenced to 12 weeks, he will be released after nine weeks and three
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
days. Whenever a judge in Scotland passes a sentence of 11 weeks, we shall hear the cry, "No my Lord, I want 12 weeks." [	<i>Interruption.</i>] What an absurd proposition. When the hon. Member for Ayr realises what the result is, he will not be so happy. We must have some consistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to examine the matter and perhaps he will also consider the financial aspects. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East made a relevant point and I want the Minister to challenge the £7.5 million. That is on the record. He said that he will write to me and I look forward to his challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 27, line 1, leave out "initial".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 153, in page 27, line 2, leave out "twelve" and insert "thirty". No. 124, in page 27, leave out lines 5 to 13. No. 155, in page 27, leave out lines 17 to 25. No. 159, in page 27, line 17, leave out "and (3)". No. 160, in page 27, line 20, leave out from "(2)" to end of line 21. No. 161, in page 27, leave out lines 31 to 33. No. 128, in page 27, line 36, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'"Prescribed minimum standard' means an absence of misconduct report".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 123 would ensure that the maximum of 12 early release days that can be earned in each two-month period is determined solely by the extent to which the prisoner's behaviour during that period attained the prescribed minimum standard. The reason for tabling the amendment is that it removes the requirement of prison staff to assess the extent to which a prisoner's behaviour during the period has exceeded the prescribed minimum standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it would remove subjective decision making from the granting of six of the 12 available early release days in each two-month period. No objective criteria have been defined to determine the circumstances in which a prisoner may exceed the prescribed minimum standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a worry that prisoners, especially the smarter ones, will manipulate the system by feigning meaningful participation in approved activities. I shall not expand on that because the circumstances are well known. I am sure that those who run our prisons are well aware that some prisoners will genuinely seek to show improvement in their conduct, but others will merely feign it. There is always a possibility that the system will be manipulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, as a result of the Bill, the motivation of prisoners will change from a willingness to participate—voluntarily and genuinely in the regime's programmes—that would contribute to their rehabilitation and therefore to a safer community—to a motivation merely to conform so as not to lose early release days. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East referred to that. Not enough is done in prisons to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
help rehabilitation and to try to ensure that when prisoners are finally released they lead law-abiding lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would reduce the impracticality for the prison service of administering the early release arrangements. For example, the number of assessments and appeals required or likely under clause 31 would be greatly reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 153 would increase the maximum number of early release days available from 12 to 30, which would improve prison discipline and provide a proper incentive for good behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 155 would ensure that changes to the early release days cannot be achieved by statutory instrument. The number of early release days available should be provided for in primary legislation only. The amendment would ensure that changes to the number of early release days would be possible only after full parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, amendment No. 128 would amend subsection (7) of clause 28. That is necessary because SACRO has offered advice, based on its experience, that good behaviour should be the minimum standard required of all prisoners. The absence of misconduct reports should be all that can reasonably be expected from most prisoners, especially given the patchy availability of programmes, education and work in the prison estate. SACRO questions the capacity of the Scottish prison service to make available to all prisoners the opportunity to participate in programmes designed to address offending behaviour. Any extension of such programmes as currently exist would require significant additional resources. As the Minister is being so free with Scottish Office resources this morning, perhaps he might find something extra for such an extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable difficulty would attach to any attempt to measure a prisoner's behaviour over a reasonable period sufficient to demonstrate that it was good enough to merit reward. SACRO is concerned that to require prisoners to participate in programmes designed to address offending behaviour could lead prisoners to participate in programmes for the wrong reasons, thereby wasting valuable limited resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the approach to be effective, it must be linked to a continuation of opportunity within the community. Currently, those links are inadequate. Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons has already criticised the absence of follow-on programmes for sex offenders on release and SACRO is aware that similar difficulties exist for drug abusers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to offer some thoughts of my own on the amendments as well as those of SACRO, Some time ago, I visited Cornton Vale prison and discovered that the education programmes there were extremely limited. I know that the Minister has since taken steps to widen those programmes to some extent, but opportunities for education and training remain extremely limited compared to those afforded to male prisoners in other prisons. The stated reason for that is, quite simply, that there is one women's prison, which is not very large, in Scotland and that, therefore, it is difficult to run education programmes. But,
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
heavens, in these days of distance learning and computerised learning programmes, problems that existed in the past should not exist now. In particular, I think that more should be done to try to rehabilitate women prisoners, especially those serviing longer sentences, through education and training. That would give them some hope of independence and the ability to earn a lawful living in the community on release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My sympathies also go to male prisoners who can spend years in prison and not be given any real chance to live a law-abiding life on release because of the difficulty of finding work if one has a record and because there is not an appropriate spread of opportunities. I hope that the Minister will address those various points in his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady mentioned Cornton Vale. I visited Cornton Vale and a number of other prisons last Friday. I understand that the hon. Member for Dumbarton will visit Cornton Vale as well. Programmes, especially those dealing with drugs and related medical problems, operate effectively there. I was reassured during my visit by the dedication of the staff who are determined to do everything in their power to attain the highest possible standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise one more point relating to Cornton Vale, which the hon. Member for Dumbarton touched on earlier. I believe that courts are well advised to use disposals such as community service orders and supervised attendance orders when dealing with minor offenders. Disposals that are of service to the community should be considered for youngsters who have been convicted of shoplifting or another offence that is, without question, a crime. That point was emphasised to me when I visited Cornton Vale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 128 seeks to define the prescribed minimum standard as "an absence of misconduct reports". That is unhelpful for two reasons. First, on a technical level, a misconduct report is not itself a finding of guilt; it is a charge considered at a disciplinary hearing and it may or may not be proved. If it is not proved, then it should not affect the prisoner's entitlement to early release. Secondly, the earning of early release should be about more than simply not breaching prison discipline. Prisoners should be required to demonstrate positive good behaviour and that they are making constructive use of their time in prison to address their offending behaviour. As appropriate, that might mean participating in a programme on drug addiction or anger management, as well as working productively in the prison workshops. The prison service is developing such programmes throughout Scotland. Clause 28 will provide a real incentive to prisoners to make a positive effort to co-operate with the prison regime and to tackle their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 153 seeks to retain too generous a measure of early release. Reduction of sentences by 30 days every two months, even if earned by good behaviour, is simply unacceptable and would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
undermine the Government's whole approach. We are determined to restore meaning to the sentence ordered by the court. Sentences should mean what they say; that is the whole purpose of the honesty in sentencing proposals. We accept the need of a margin of early release to be available as an inducement to good behaviour in prison, but we consider that 12 days every two months represents a sufficient incentive. A level as high as 30 days would risk undermining public confidence in sentencing in the criminal courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 155 seeks to delete subsections (6) and (7) from clause 28. Those subsections provide a power for the Secretary of State by order to amend the provisons of subsections (2) and (3) of the clause. That is a useful power and I do not think there can be any substantial objection to it as it is made clear in subsection (5) that the power cannot be used in such a way as to reduce the maximum amounts of early release that may be earned. For these reasons, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every time the Minister speaks he provokes me into saying something. He mentioned that public confidence in court sentencing was important, but I think he misunderstands what the public are genuinely worried about. Sentences given to individual criminals are not a matter of great public interest, but the level of crime prevalent in any community is. The public want crime levels to be reduced. That takes us back to the debate about what to do with people once they have been sentenced by the courts. I thought what the Minister said—say what you mean and mean what you say on sentences—sounded rather Blairite. But there is too much stick—as opposed to carrot—in the Government's belief that people should spend longer in prison and that while they are in prison, they should be subject to stricter discipline and should have to overcome greater barriers before they are given early release. The Government think that the criminal justice system is about locking people up and keeping them away from society. But the Government will have to release those criminals back into society at some stage, and if the criminals have not changed their offending behaviour, their sentences will not have served any useful function because they will reoffend and crime levels will continue to rise in the communities that we represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our attitude to running prisons is completely different. Generous early release programmes should be tied to how offenders react to their offending behaviour and whether they do something positive about it. If we try to encourage offenders in prison to change their patterns of behaviour by offering a carrot—our proposals offer more carrot than stick; the Conservatives offer more stick than carrot—there is a better chance that, on release, they will not reoffend and be a menace to our communities. That is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the absence of misconduct report. His first objection was purely technical, so let us change the way the amendment is phrased. Prisoners should be given every encouragement to win early release, but he seems to be making it more
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
difficult for them. Making it more likely that they will not earn early release will cause them to become disillusioned and further embittered. It is all right for the Minister to sit here in the Committee and say that prisoners should have the challenge of showing positive behaviour. Many of them have been locked up for long periods and they have nothing else to do but serve time in prison. They are quite happy to go to drug programmes and classes to give the impression of having a positive attitude, but their behaviour has not really changed. They will do their time, come back out and not be reformed in any sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key, apart from encouragement, is to ensure that resources are available in the prison service to tackle offenders' problems. That is what the Government are not doing. They are pouring money into more prisons. We heard this morning that five new private sector prisons will be built in Scotland and that £100 million extra will be spent every year to keep more people locked up in prison for longer. How much will be spent on real programmes to change offending behaviour and on real prison systems which try to link good behaviour to a genuine change in attitude when offenders leave prison? Very little indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both sides of the Committee share the same perspective. We want less crime, safer streets and people to be at less risk of someone offending against them. But our different attitudes to achieving that end have been obvious this morning. The Government have got it wrong and they will probably make the situation worse in Scotland. If they would only listen, they would improve conditions for all our constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall put some other points to the Minister. He said that the Government's view could be summed up as honesty in sentencing. When the general public say that they want honesty in sentencing they want appropriate sentencing. There has too often been an imbalance in society with heavy sentences for offences against property and light sentences for offences against the person. I am sure that the general public do not believe that a person sentenced to prison, who genuinely shows an effort to change his ways and in relation to whom there is good evidence to think that he will not continue to act in a criminal way on release, should be kept in prison for months or years longer. That is simply a waste of public money. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, it could work against any successful rehabilitation. A prisoner might think that it does not matter how he behaves because he has to remain incarcerated in prison for months and years, which is a great disincentive to co-operating with programmes to change his behaviour and ensuring that he leaves with a changed attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honesty in sentencing is being used in an inflexible way. It implies that the public expect people to serve long sentences no matter how they behave in prison. I do not believe that they think that, but I would be interested to know whether any Conservative member of the Committee disagrees with me. We want severe sentences for terrible crimes. However, if someone shows a genuine wish to reform in every possible way,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
should not that be taken into account in a more flexible way than the Government are so far willing to consider?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak, but, having listened to the two previous speakers, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will bear in mind the fact that, for 30 years and more, all politicians have been trying desperately to find solutions and answers that stop people becoming criminals or that persuade them to change their criminal ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plea of the hon. Member for Dundee, East comes from hope not experience. Experience tells us that his route does not work; successive Parliaments have tried it and failed. The route that we want to follow is one that most of my constituents support. They expect criminals to be put away for the duration of their sentence and take the view—it may be a simplistic one—that, at least when they are inside, they are not reoffending and causing trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In listening to Opposition pleas, my right hon. Friend the Minister should reject them on the basis that experience tells us that the route they recommend has not worked and we are trying a new one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can sum up fairly quickly on this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the more willing an offender may be to deal with his offending behaviour through participation in programmes the greater will be the prospect of lasting changes to that behaviour. I cannot agree with the hon. Member for Dundee, East, however, that it is wrong to provide an incentive for the prisoner to participate in such programmes by holding out the prospect of earned release. Prisoners will not be compelled to take part in programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Friday, at Low Moss prison I observed a very good voluntary programme for short-term prisoners that aims to deal with their drug addiction. That programme was highly successful. Those concerned may initially entertain doubts about a programme's usefulness to them, but, in the end, useful changes in attitude are there for all to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) has said and ask for the amendment to be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 27, line 13, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) The Scottish Prison Service shall be responsible for ensuring that a course of instruction and counselling, which is approved in regulations by the Secretary of State for Scotland, is provided to each prisoner during his prison sentence, and prior to release.".</p></blockquote>
The Minister said much in his response to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) about what the Government are working on in the way of specialist courses for people who have a drug dependency problem. He also mentioned programmes of anger management and, ominously, work in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
workshops. In reality, in most cases of incarceration, people work in the workshops, but the women in Cornton Vale do not take part in worthwhile jobs. One of their tasks was sewing shrouds, which seemed a strange occupation and not one likely to enlighten or advance someone's attitude to life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of amendment No. 125 is to give the Government a chance to put their resources where their mouth is. They claim that they have a few programmes, but I suspect that those will be token ones. They will not involve widespread use of education in rehabilitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to persuade the Government to treat prisoners who commit heinous offences in a multiple way as mentally unfit people who should be assisted to deal with their psychological and psychiatric misbehaviour. I suspect that the Government are not persuaded to adopt that suggestion; their attitude to crime was summed up by the hon. Member for North Tayside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government aspired to rehabilitate offenders, but they have not succeeded because they have not made the necessary resources available. They have not employed the professional educators, psychologists and psychiatrists, so they have failed. Now they want to go back to slamming people up, and they claim that it is right to lock people away for longer periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Opposition Members and many other people and organisations outside the House—such as the Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and the Law Society of Scotland—believe that Government policy only causes more people to be locked up for longer. When such offenders leave prison four or five years after the Bill is enacted they will come out even more criminalised and more likely to exhibit recidivist behaviour. We hope that a general election will prevent the Bill being enacted and allow some sensible decisions to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Scottish Prison Service shall be responsible for ensuring that a course of instruction and counselling, which is approved in regulations by the Secretary of State for Scotland, is provided to each prisoner during his prison sentence, and prior to release."</p></blockquote>
That does not seem a lot to ask. The Government say that they have programmes in mind for drug abusers and for people who show out-of-control anger and violent behaviour, but people go to prison for many other reasons and all the reasons should be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people go to prison because they are socially inadequate and ill educated. Often, young people have no chance to live a different kind of life because, sadly, the heroes in their society are the people who commit crime and get away with it. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East described the people who seem to be above the law because they never get caught. They run crime rings in their localities and appear to get away with it. Such people become the heroes and role models. It is sad that our society offers so impoverished an environment for many people that that can happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
I entered local government as a community activist, trying to offer alternatives to those street heroes. I tried to promote activities in the community centres or youth clubs that would allow people to succeed and become other heroes for the local communities, rather than the hard men on the corner. People who end up in prison often have no malice in their hearts, but society gives them no option but to become petty criminals. That is sad, but it is what happens: I know, because I have talked to those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a teacher of children with learning difficulties for 14 years. Many of the people who end up in prison would have been in the remedial departments of their schools or in the sort of school that I worked in. They all need special courses, counselling or some kind of special support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Members take on board the strong submission from SACRO. That organisation works with offenders when they leave prison. It tries to find such people another route into society before they offend again. People in those circumstances often cannot find homes or employment because they have been in gaol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SACRO works in the margin between prison and reoffending: that margin is already small but it will get smaller still under this Government. Offenders will be sprung into society after serving five-sixths of their sentences. That is a long time, and the available provision will not be able to cope with them. The 2,200 more prison places means that there will be more prisoners coming out, and SACRO only deals with a small number of people anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal is that something should be done about the problem from inside the prison system, where people should be given some education and counselling. Resources and effort need to be applied. The Government are willing to spend £100 million on private prisons. Surely they can demonstrate their commitment by going one step further and providing several million pounds for decent counselling and education. That would get to the root of the problem by addressing the behavioural failures of prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not act, there will be a massive problem in five or six years. There will be more prisoners and more pressure. There will be more criminalised behaviour, because prison criminalises people. We shall rue the day we let the Government go ahead with this Bill without imposing a balance on this clause. If the Government are serious about drug rehabilitation and anger containment programmes, they will take on board the spirit of the amendment even if they do not adopt it word for word. The Government must make it clear that they intend to do something about education and rehabilitation in prison, so that they can at least ameliorate some of the effects of their proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. First, I hope that my right hon. Friend will read the amendment carefully because it looks like an open-ended financial commitment with no restriction on it. It would be unwise to enter into that.

	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
Secondly, like the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) I have experience of living and working with and trying to help people from deprived backgrounds. I have never believed that living in an area where there is a shortage of the things which are looked on as the comforts of life has driven people to crime. If that was so, all the youngsters with whom I grew up would be criminals. They are not and have not been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two people who grew up in my street became criminals. We could tell who they would be from day one. They became criminals largely because of their family environments, not the street they lived in or the community they lived among. Attention could have been drawn to that much more quickly than was done. Anyone who has grown up in such an environment knows that the youngsters all know who will be ne'er do wells, be shy of work and try to cheat the system.

Money spent outside of prison on youth activities in such areas brings far greater rewards to the citizens than attempting to address the problems of the few who present society with problems. I tell my right hon. Friend that I am not one of those who thinks that prison can somehow turn the bad ones into good. I much prefer to spend the money on keeping the good ones good. Much more money should be spent in that way than in this area. That is why I draw attention to the wording of the amendment: it is an open commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that I and others who think like me do not believe that some scope exists—it must, because we have to address the drugs problem—but one should not give such open-ended commitments. Unless good people are seen to be rewarded for being good, people out there in society say, "You get on better in this country if you're nasty and bad, because everybody cares for you. Nobody cares for you when you're good." That is the view in the housing estates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it strange that the hon. Gentleman does not seem to accept that the fear of those whom he calls the good people—the vast majority of citizens, I would say—is the impact of the behaviour of people who do not keep to the norms and standards of society. Many people live in insecure environments—in fear—because of the continuing recidivist and anti-social behaviour of the very people who may have been helped if something had been done about them when they were in prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In many ways the hon. Gentleman and I have areas of agreement. I do not doubt that he, the hon.

My questioning is based on real experience, not on some theoretical approach.

Perth prison used to be in my constituency. I took an active interest in the problems within it. I shall have a prison in my constituency as a result of the boundary changes and will be interested in developments there. My concern is primarily with how public money is spent so that we get the best solutions. I can do that best not by wearing my heart on my sleeve, but by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
asking how the problems can be addressed. Are we to spend an additional £100 million on prisons in Scotland? I say spend it on the cadet forces—we will get a far better return for our money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 10.10 on page 44 of the White Paper clearly states that the Government will expect each prison to match more closely its counselling, education and training opportunities with the specific needs of its prisoner population to help reduce offending and minimise the number of potential victims of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside that it is not necessary to approve a programme under a regulatory system. The amendment stipulates that each prisoner will receive a course of instruction and counselling. Today and in a previous sitting, we discussed the provision of programmes in prison. As I said earlier, the prison service is planning work on programme accreditation. It is envisaged that a panel including experts independent of the prison service will assess each programme against criteria to ensure that it is properly designed, will meet the needs of the target group, has specified outcomes and has built-in monitoring and evaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accreditation will take account of best practice in other jurisdictions and will introduce a means of quality control. Different programmes will be required to meet different needs. No single course will be appropriate for all prisoners, so I do not think it appropriate to proceed with a regulatory system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Minister has greatly disappointed me—I thought that he was about to put his toe in the water and offer some concession, but since he is not, I would like to press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 27, line 13, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) Early release days, once awarded, shall not subsequently be withdrawn.".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that earned release is not forfeited by the prisoner at a later date. That would ensure that the reward system for early release was seen as credible and predictable and could provide adequate incentive for serving prisoners. Release days withheld should be confined to 12 available days within each two-month period. Once earned, they should not be subject to retrospective loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of equity. Once a prisoner loses any early release days in a two-month period, they cannot subsequently be regained. Similarly, once a prisoner has been awarded early release days, they should be secured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made great claims about release days being earned. It is a matter of concern to us that once early release days have been earned, they should not later be taken away. It is not right to hold out a carrot to people, allow them to secure early release
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
days and later say to them, "No, they are being withdrawn because of something you did at a later date."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We acknowledge what the Minister said about release being earned. I agree with much of what he said about long sentences, but I am concerned about people on minor sentences of, for example, less than three months. They might be people who have defaulted on fines for not paying their television licence. Some of them will be women. I wonder how they can earn early release because the kind of suggestions that the Minister has made this morning, such as drugs programmes, will not apply to them. What would apply to someone who has been locked up for poverty's sake? People do not pay their television licence because they do not want to—nine times out of 10 it is because they have absolutely no choice and cannot pay. Perhaps the Minister thinks that they should not be locked up at all. Were they among the people that he had in mind for electronic tagging? Were they perhaps going to be tagged all day to their television sets—the same ones for which they did not get a licence in the first place. I am concerned about such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned that, once releases are earned, they are earned for all time. If we take them away, we will cause only greater bitterness. The amendments make it clear that such incentives should, in fact, be incentives and that people should have something to work towards. If we take an incentive away later, it is no incentive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady spoke about minor offenders not going to prison. When I was at Cornton Vale, I realised that some people were in for relatively minor offences, such as fiddling child benefit. That is not such a minor offence—it is fraud—and the sentence was the disposal of the courts. But I strongly recommend that the courts consider—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman is muttering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is appalling for a Minister to have to admit that, during his Government's time in office, women are in prison for fiddling child benefit. I used to be a prison visitor to Cornton Vale and I am appalled that anyone should be locked up there and not given the opportunity to be in society and to find some way to pay the money back. That would be suitable redress for child benefit fraud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying very clearly that community service orders or supervised attendance orders are appropriate disposals for the courts for minor offences. The courts are independent of the Executive, as they should be. Those disposals are important and should be borne in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we put an end to this emotional claptrap? Is not it the case that fewer than 200 women are in prison in Scotland and that someone who commits an offence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have, at times, strayed too far from the subject. The amendment is narrowly defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, but the Chairman has prevented me from responding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 135 would prevent the forfeiture of earned early release days and so remove the most effective sanction for breaches of prison discipline. While a range of other punishments is available to governors, such as loss of prison wages or recreational activities, the existing back stop of awarding additional days is vital to maintaining good order in prisons. It will be just as necessary to have a similar provision in the new system, which is why we ask the Committee to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>Amendments made: No. 237, in page 27, line 30, after "release", insert "and".</p>
	<p>No. 238, in page 27, leave out lines 34 to 36.—[	<i>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because the Opposition cannot accept the provisions in the clause that abolish the parole system, other than for life prisoners. That system has had an acknowledged and positive role in determining the appropriate release date of selected long-term prisoners. The Bill will make the system less, not more, safe. Long-term prisoners currently have mandatory supervision, but they will not have it under the Bill so the public will be put at greater risk as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's proposed system for automatic early release is based largely on conduct or behaviour in prison. It no longer adequately takes account of the risks a prisoner may pose to the community in determining release. Under the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, all prisoners serving four or more years were released under mandatory supervision, subject to full pre-release assessment and information and transmission to the supervising authority. That will no longer be the case unless the court, at the time of sentencing, has the prescience of mind to say that there is a supervised release order. The public will be less safe as a result of this Bill than they were before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, education programmes are available for only a minority of prisoners. Equitable access to such programmes would require high-volume delivery under the proposed arrangement. Nothing that the Minister has said this morning about finance will give us any comfort or support. Indeed, the Bill refers to the fact that the extra 2,200 prisoners over five years will add £65 million to £100 million per annum at current prices. Where will we get that, given this week's Budget settlement in the Red Book?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
The block grant for Scotland faces a cut of £361 million. With regard to the control total—that includes a block grant and prisons as well—from November 1995, planned spending for the Scottish Office was £14,691 million. But for 1997–98, the figure has been reduced to £14,330 million—a cut of £361 million, including the prison service. So where will the money come from?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are increased tensions in prisons, acknowledged by the Scottish prison service. The most up-to-date information shows that there are significant increases in assaults by prisoners on other prisoners. That continues to be a matter of extreme concern to the Scottish prison service, as is the high suicide rate. The population pressures are acute: 6,000 prisoners in an establishment for 5,500 creates a pressure pot, and it will be made worse by taking away early release. It will do nothing for conditions in prison, as well as putting additional pressures on those in prison and those without.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Making the punishment fit the crime was a kneejerk reaction to the situation in England and Wales, which will increase the prison population by more than 2,000. Where will the money for the additional five prisons come from? Lord McCluskey spoke about this in a speech to the Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders earlier this year. Opposition Members have considered the situation: five extra prisons over a 25-year period comes to £1.8 billion. Where is that to come from? It is nothing less than political deceit practised on the electorate when the Government cannot give us the figures and tell us what is happening. Out of a Scottish prison service annual budget of £160 million, where will £1.8 billion come from over a 25-year period? This is a recipe for instability and disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I refer to the comments of Lord Bingham, the Lord Chief Justice, when he was interviewed on the Frost programme a couple of weeks ago. The principles in England and Wales are the same as in Scotland. David Frost asked him about the abolition of parole, and he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think that experience of those provisions shows they work very well"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the ones that were introduced in the 1993 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This cannot be within the scope of the Bill. I should therefore be grateful if you would proceed, if you wish to, without referring to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Winterton. I will close on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately, the issues that arise are the same for Scotland in that this provision will increase the tensions, resentment and unhappiness in prisons. That will happen in Scotland as a result of the clause, and the Opposition cannot support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make it clear that our consultation paper, "Making the Punishment Fit the Crime" elicited support from several bodies. The Central Advisory Committee for Scotland on Justices of the Peace and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland supported the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
proposals to reduce the margin of early release to one sixth. The Association of Scottish Police Superintendents similarly commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a prisoner should at the outset be required to serve the full sentence unless he/she earned early release. This would eliminate any perceived ambiguity and unfairness in the current system and would increase the public's confidence in the legal process."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Even those who did not necessarily agree with all our solutions frequently recognised the problem. The Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Ross, stated:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the arrangements for early release of prisoners which presently exist, I regard myself when imposing sentence as taking part in something in the nature of a charade."</p></blockquote>
Thus our consultations revealed a body of opinion that agreed that something needed to be done to uphold public confidence in the criminal justice system. That opinion came particularly from the police, who are in the front line and close to public feeling on those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 28 sets out the main points of the new early release scheme under which any measure of early release must be earned by good behaviour in prison and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
