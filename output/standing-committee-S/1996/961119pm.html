	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, Sir James. May I reassure the hon. Member of Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) about something he mentioned this morning? He wanted to know whether regulations have been implemented. I am happy to say that no rules have been made under section 13 of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 because they are not needed—the standards do the job instead. National standards have been prepared in full consultation with all relevant criminal justice interests and enforced as a condition of 100 per cent. central Government funding of criminal justice social work services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that a participative approach is preferable to falling back on Secretary of State rules provided in section 13 of the 1993 Act. Section 13 provides a fall back power in the event of standards not being achieved or maintained. There has been no reason to consider using that power. It was not relevant to the Maguire case, because he was sentenced before the Act came into force. If it had applied to him, he would have been released at the two-thirds point and would have been free of all supervision at the end of the second 10 year sentence. If this Bill had been law, he would have received an automatic life sentence for the second offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is a point of order for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another point of order, Sir James, but I shall return to the Minister's statement because I do not accept it entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the Minister gave a letter to all of us in the Committee on the restriction of liberty and electronic monitoring of young offenders in the Bill. He stated that comments relating to the consultation process should be submitted by 4 January. I have before me a letter from the Scottish Office social work services group dated 14 November 1996, signed by D. C. Macnab, telling individuals that comments should be submitted by Wednesday 4 December. Will the Minister clarify the situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can clarify the matter. Responses will have to be received by 4 January. Another letter is in the process of being sent. If it has not already gone out, I hope that it will be sent
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
in the next few hours. It will make it clear that the date is 4 January, which is an appropriate time to allow responses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it—I cannot really follow the Minister's logic—that it was a mistake which is being corrected by another letter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it was an error. The date of 4 December was not approved by Ministers. I am glad to say that the corret date is as stated in my letter. The incorrect details in the former letter are being put right with all possible speed. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for pointing out the discrepancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None of those have been points of order for the Chair. I have no responsibility for letters. We should move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Earlier today, we discussed hon. Members access to information under the Data Protection Act 1984. I have a copy of a letter sent to me by the chief constable of Strathclyde which says:

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must return to my previous statement. That is not a point of order for the Chair.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can you say it just once again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Connarty. Putting an Irish emphasis on the "a" might be the way to remind people. I am such a quiet person that people have difficulty in getting to know me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendments Nos. 112 and 111 is to suggest to the Government that they are making foolish mandatory provisions in the Bill that would take away judges' flexibility in court proceedings in Scotland and cause serious concern to those judges. The public, however, suggest to politicians that when someone commits the kind of crimes that are listed in part 1 of the qualifying offences—culpable homicide, attempted murder, rape or attempted rape, sodomy, aggravated assault causing severe injury, attempt to rape or ravish a victim, and lewd, libidinous or indecent behaviour or practices towards a child—some kind of psychiatric treatment should be part of the sentence, although there may be some difficulty [	<i>in</i>] how to apply it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to raise that issue and to hear from the Minister what progress has been made in the thinking on the use of psychiatry in the treatment of constant offenders, particularly those who are violent and sexually violent. I look forward to the Minister telling us how the Government and those who give them advice feel about the matter, whether any research has been done into the use of such treatments and where the Government stand in relation to what the public want: that a repeat offender, particularly where the offences are such vile crimes, should have that treatment as part of his sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipate that the Government will say that, in the context of mandatory sentencing, some of the qualifying offences may not be appropriate. An example is robbery, although robbery with a firearm may require psychiatric treatment. Another is dealing in drugs in a purely economic, non-violent way, where the offender is looking to make money out of a demand-led part of the economy—drug taking among the young. Such an offender may not need psychiatric treatment. Leaving those aspects apart, I should like to hear what the Government have to say if they are not willing to apply my proposals to those offences in part 1 of the qualifying offences that I have just mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, amendments Nos. 68 and 69 aim to introduce a mandatory provision that some drug offenders should undergo attendance at an approved drug-awareness programme. Those reasonable amendments respond to commonsense approaches from the public who would like the Government to move in that direction. I would like to know the Government's thinking on that matter and whether any progress can be made. Is there any part in the spirit
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
of the amendments that the Government are willing to take on board and will they consider bringing forward amendments later if they do not accept these?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 111 and 112 are simply unnecessary. What they attempt to achieve, in a rather haphazard way, is already provided for in existing provisions or is expressly covered in other parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 112 would allow the court to send an offender aged 21 or over, who has received an automatic life sentence, to a hospital for treatment—but what of offenders under 21 years of age who require this treatment? The amendment also fails to set the procedures for determining which offenders require treatment. It also allows the court to send an offender aged 18 to 20 on a course of counselling, presumably while he is serving his automatic life sentence at a young offenders' institution—but what of adult offenders?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) that offenders who receive a custodial sentence because of the severity of their offence, but who require treatment for a mental condition, should receive that treatment. That is why we have proposed in clauses 5 and 6 a new disposal for the courts—the hospital direction. If a person is convicted on indictment of an offence punishable by imprisonment, a court will, in addition to any sentence of imprisonment, be able to direct that he be admitted and detained in an appropriate hospital. He would receive treatment for his mental condition until treatment was no longer necessary or effective and he would then be transferred to serve any remaining balance of his sentence of imprisonment or detention. The clauses make detailed and comprehensive provision for that disposal and they render that part of the hon. Gentleman's amendments superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to amendments Nos. 112, 111, 68 and 69—which suggest programmes to treat offending behaviour—I also agree with the hon. Gentleman that offenders in custody should be encouraged to face up to their offending behaviour. That applies especially to drug offenders, who are referred to in amendments Nos. 68 and 69.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am not convinced that particular programmes should be prescribed by a court or that it is necessary to approve programmes under a statutory regulatory system. First, we should be cautious about setting a precedent that a court should attach particular conditions to custodial sentences. That could lead to demands for a range of conditions, which would make it difficult for the service providers, the prison service and local authorities to respond with the necessary flexibility to offenders' changing needs. Secondly, an offender cannot be ordered to change his attitude. Ordering attendance on a programme of counselling and therapy will be ineffective if the offender is totally unwilling to participate. Thirdly, the Scottish prison service already challenges prisoners to participate in programmes to correct offending behaviour. That applies to all offenders, whatever their age and whatever their offence. There are a number of programmes across the prison estate, including
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
programmes on drugs awareness, alcohol misuse, sex offending and anger management. The Scottish prison service is planning work on programme accreditation so that account can be taken of best practice and the introduction of a means of quality control. On that basis, I do not believe that statutory provision in respect of drug awareness programmes is required, and I therefore cannot accept amendments Nos. 68 and 69.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, the programmes are being developed in prisons. I have seen them in operation and know that they are effective. Attempts are made to persuade prisoners to attend such programmes, but if the authorities meet with total non-co-operation, it can be useful to use compulsion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister listed a number of programmes—drug awareness, alcohol abuse, sexual abuse, control of anger—that are used in the prison service. He said that he resisted amendments Nos. 68 and 69 because local authorities and the prison service may not be able to respond to the demands of the programmes that the amendments would establish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Monday, several Opposition Members met representatives from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to discuss the Bill. They discussed with us their worry about the nature of the programmes that currently operate in the prison service. One would hope that those who run programmes that try to rehabilitate people with serious emotional or psychological problems would be properly qualified professionals who know what they are doing. That would ensure that prisoners attending the programmes gain some benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representatives from COSLA told us that, increasingly, local authorities are not being allowed into prisons to assist in programmes. Qualified social workers are not involved; warders do the necessary work as a part-time activity in addition to looking after prisoners. The Minister spoke about an accreditation system that would be applied in prisons. The Bill is all about locking people up for long periods—it refers to automatic life sentences, mandatory life sentences and seven-year sentences for drug traffickers. However, when a person is sent to prison, nothing is done to deal with his offensive behaviour; instead, warders are given time off and a wee bit of extra overtime to attend classes. Is that how the Government are running the prison service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's explanatory memorandum states that over the next five years, there will be an extra 2,200 offenders in prison as a result of the Bill. I understand that that will increase the prison population in Scotland by about 50 per cent. There will be a great many more prisoners and a great many more serious problems as a result. The hope is that when prisoners come out of prison they will not reoffend, but that will not happen if we are to run programmes on the cheap as the Minister seems to be suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that mandatory sentences could become nothing more than an apprenticeship for greater criminality if programmes are not undertaken when offenders are in prison?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. I have no direct experience of prisons, thank God, but I recall reading books about Irish prisoners in prison for political reasons. In those books, prisons become schools where prisoners spend their time learning from each other and picking up skills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman's comment about Irish prisoners being imprisoned for political reasons is totally out of context. Irish prisoners are imprisoned because they are criminals. That is the end of the story in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you, Sir James, would not allow me to indulge in a debate about the nature of the political struggle in Northern Ireland, especially since I saw the film "Michael Collins" on Friday and might get carried away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) made a fair point: if quality programmes, run by properly qualified people, are not available for offenders when they enter prison—as the Minister seems to be hinting might be the case—we are in danger of prisoners developing behaviour worse than that they displayed before they went into prison in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are important, but the Minister showed no seriousness in dealing with them. We do not want simply to punish people for offending by locking them up in warehouses for people; we want to try and change them while they are in prison so that they do not reoffend when they leave. Public safety depends on our being able to change their offending behaviour. There is no great relief in the fact that an offender will be inside for 12 years instead of 10 if, at the end of the period, he comes out and continues to offend. There will be other Maguires. No matter how much of a sentence an offender spends in gaol, he will come out, reoffend and kill. The best way to deal with such people is to ensure that while they are in prison, something useful is done with them. Attempts must be made to change their offending behaviour. That is what the amendments are about and the Minister's answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) was deplorable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to respond to a few of the Minister's comments. He said that the amendments were haphazard, but they are consistent enough to be applied to all the offences. The Government's late clauses are haphazard in that they consider some people as mentally disordered and propose to treat them but will somehow not treat others who display clear anomic, antisocial tendencies or the responses of a partially deranged mind that requires deep psychological and psychiatric analysis. The clauses prove that the Goverment have not thought the matter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
through. I suspect that they have never advanced any such proposals because they have not sufficiently studied the issue because they will not provide the resources to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a question about how difficult it would be, even in the suggested programme on drug awareness, to have people respond flexibly, but now the Government stand on their head and tell us there can be no flexibility of sentencing from judges although there can be flexibility of treatment in prison. What they really mean is that they know that they will not properly resource prisons or educational programmes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said. They will not resource prisoners' treatment in prison. They slam them up and prisoners learn to be better criminals and more effective in the criminal world. That is shown by the fact that they leave prison, reoffend in more serious ways and end up back in prison. That is the record of the prison system in Scotland—a growing number of people end up in prison and the Government intend to increase that growing number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone always asks how effective current programmes are. We suggest a few other approaches, but the Government are not even willing to examine them. It is sad to realise that we are discussing a Bill about postures, not a Bill about treatment and the prevention of further criminal responses by those in prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads clauses 5 to 10, he will see that his wide requirements would be in the wrong place and that the Government have addressed the issues in those clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but the suggestion in those clauses is that all those who have double—offended require mandatory psychiatric treatment. There are problems with the list of offences, but the Government chose that list. Some offenders are likely to be of disturbed mind, but some may just have had criminal intent and greed. If they had been stockbrokers or share-dealers they would have been applauded instead of being accused of dealing in death by selling drugs. The motivation may have been not psychological disturbance, but the wish to make a lot of money from drug dealing instead of doing something else. There is a slight inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of putting people into the category of mentally disordered offenders is that the judge will be asked to make a judgment that someone is mentally disordered. If we examine the resourcing of psychiatric provision in prisons and hospitals, we must conclude that very few people will receive psychiatric treatment. If that is to be a mandatory method of treating people who commit such heinous offences, resources will be required from the Government. I suggest that the Government are not willing to commit those resources or to respond to the body of opinion throughout the world that we must treat people as though they are ill

	<br><q><p>'''exceptional circumstances" means any unusual or particular circumstances of the accused and does not include consideration which relate to the resourceing of the supervised release order;'.</p></q>
The amendment would further define "exceptional circumstances", which may allow the courts not to make a supervised release order. We have debated that in our previous sittings and the Minister knows that the amendment relates to the "exceptional circumstances" which would justify a court not making a supervised release order. The resourcing of the supervision, although a consideration to which the court must be alert, should not represent the basis upon which the court would not make the order. If it is accepted that resourcing is an expectional circumstance, there will be little incentive for local authorities adequately to provide for supervision of release orders. The purpose of the amendment is to probe what the courts may truly consider to be exceptional circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand and agree with the purpose of the amendment. It is not our intention that the court should exercise its very limited discretion not to impose a supervised release order in circumstances in which it would otherwise be required to do so for reasons relating to the resourcing of the supervised release order systems. The general availability of resources for supervised release orders is not a consideration that the courts should take into account before imposing a sentence. We made it clear when debating other aspects of the Bill that it is for the courts to detemine the sentence within the law as enacted by Parliament. It is, therefore, the Government's job to provide the resources to enable the custody or supervision imposed to be necessarily delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Dumbarton is unnecessary to achieve its intended purpose. The wording is such that it could be too restrictive in requiring the court to take into account only the circumstances of the accused. We wish courts to have wider discretion—for example, to take into account the circumstances of the offence. I agree with the purpose behind the amendment, but I do not believe that it is necessary. Given my explanation and assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be willing to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 29 would probe the application of restriction of liberty orders. It would clarify the terms of new section 245A of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which allows a court to make a restriction of liberty order—a curfew order—when an offence for which there is no mandatory sentence has been committed. Does that mean that such orders will be applied only to minor and petty offences? What research has been carried out into the effectiveness of such orders in England and Wales?

Amendment No. 30 would ensure that only the High Court or the sheriff court could issue restriction of liberty orders. District courts should not be allowed to make such disposals until their value and cost-effectiveness is assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 79 would ensure that restriction of liberty orders could be made only as an alternative, rather than as an addition to, custodial sentences. Restriction of liberty orders should be applied only where an offender has not received a custodial sentence. A form of disposal that would, for example, allow a six-month restriction order to follow six months' imprisonment would constitute a double penalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before he replies to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North, will the Minister explain the full significance of restriction of liberty orders as this is the first opportunity that we have had to discuss them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses state that
	<br><q><p>"this Clause provides for the introduction of a new sentencing disposal—'the restriction of liberty order'—which the courts may use to restrict the movements of offenders. Specifically, an order may restrict an offender to specified places at specified times for specified periods, and/or may exclude an offender from specified places".</p></q>
In what sense is that new? I understand that courts already have the power to impose a curfew on an offender and can require the offender to attend a community hostel. To all intents and purposes, that sounds exactly like the power referred to in clause 4. I should like the Minister to make it clear whether the clause deals specifically with electronic tagging, or whether it deals with wider powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by answering the questions asked by the hon. Member for Paisley, North. The orders will be used usually, but not always, for minor offences. The obvious example is shoplifting. Curfew orders make it easier for a compulsive shoplifter who commits a petty offence not to go to prison, while safeguarding the community. Perhaps a better example is a football hooligan, who can be denied the opportunity of seeing football matches. That can be an effective disposal if that person has been a threat to others within the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of information, is this the best place to discuss all aspects of electronic tagging?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy for the hon. Member to raise any issue relating to electronic tagging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear that the purpose is not to attach a stigma to such sentences. The purpose of the provision is to safeguard the public and to provide an additional disposal to protect the community, while making it unnecessary for the offender to go to prison. I have seen a demonstration of the items involved. It is not an unpleasant disposal, but one that can effectively safeguard the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned two specific cases in which a restriction of liberty order might be appropriate. He mentioned football hooligans. I can understand how the order would work for them—they would be told that they could not attend any football matches in their area, or specific matches. I understand how that system could operate, but will the Minister expand on the case of shoplifters? I cannot understand how it would be possible to tell anyone never to enter any shops, but it would not be sensible to tell them not to enter particular shops, because they would only shoplift in other places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shoplifting is a peculiar type of offence, because it is sometimes committed by people under some strain who do not normally commit it. There is a famous case with which I am sure we are all familiar in which a pregnant woman committed the offence of shoplifting. She had never shoplifted before or after her pregnancy. It is difficult to explain, but something affects the mental state of some pregnant women. Somebody might have a thoroughly honest record before and after pregnancy; it would be grossly severe to impose some sort of restriction of liberty order in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising that subject, which I can address. Concern has been expressed, not only by the hon. Lady, but by others that the wearing of a personal transmitter required for electronic monitoring would cause unnecessary problems for offenders. In particular, it is said that the visibility of the transmitter would stigmatise the wearer and cause difficulty in his social and working life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can offer the Committee some reassurance on that point. The devices are relatively small; they can be worn on the wrist or ankle—as technology develops, they are becoming even smaller. Consequently, they should be fairly easy to conceal in most circumstances. It is likely that in the near future it will be possible to make the device look like an everyday item such as a wrist watch, so the risks of device visibility and stigmatisation are always being reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, if an offender is worried about other people's reaction, he can withhold his consent to the making of an order. The Bill provides that if an offender refuses to consent, an order will not be made. However, it is important that people are not sent to prison unnecessarily. In many cases, a restriction of liberty order is an alternative to imprisonment, and the consequent advantages of keeping the offender in the community must be weighed against the disadvantages of having to wear the transmitter, which enables the order to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is surely reasonable to conclude that, in most cases, the disadvantage to the offender of having to wear the transmitter will be more than outweighed by the advantages of being able to consent to the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the electronic device can be made to look like a wrist watch. My understanding is that the offender must not be able to remove the device, otherwise its purpose will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
defeated. If the offender could leave his watch at home and make those monitoring him believe that he was still there when he was somewhere else, the scheme would not work. That means that there will be a stigma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he was considering applying the scheme to people under the age of 16. If an offender goes to school and takes part in swimming or goes to the gym and cannot take off his watch like every other member of the class, there will be a clear stigma. It will be clear that he is tagged and that he is a bad lad who should be treated as such by teachers and fellow pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is saying "so" from a sedentary position. He might want to humiliate people as a way of changing their offending behaviour, but there is no evidence that that works. If we want people to change their offending behaviour, we should encourage them to do so, not humiliate them into doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seeks to misunderstand me. It is not our purpose to stigmatise offenders. The devices are a little more sophisticated than a watch; I have seen them. As I made clear earlier, they can be concealed. The point is that this is an effective disposal for somebody such as a joyrider, shoplifter or football hooligan—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me just finish my answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that offenders cannot go back to the football ground or shop, or cannot joyride as before because, under the pilot scheme, their movements can be traced within certain hours, suggests that the community will be protected. The costs of the pilot scheme are set out in the Bill; the costs of a fully fledged system cannot be estimated until we have the results of the pilot scheme.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trials started slowly but gradually picked up and the evidence is that they have been a success. We believe that the powers to enable pilot schemes to be set up are justified.

The amendments deal with two related issues. Amendments Nos. 29, 80, 79 and 31 are concerned with the circumstances in which an order should be made. Amendments Nos. 30, 78 and 82 deal with which courts should be able to make the orders. The amendments would impose inappropriate limitations in both areas and I shall ask the hon. Members who tabled them to withdraw them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the circumstances in which restriction on liberty orders could be imposed, the proposed limitations borrow and combine provisions from existing probation and community service legislation but in a manner that is neither useful nor helpful. Amendment No. 79, for example, would allow courts to impose restriction of liberty orders only if their objective was to secure public safety and good conduct from the offender or to prevent him from reoffending. If, having taken account of the circumstances of the offence and the offender, a court had some other objective, it would not be able to impose a restriction of liberty order even if it believed that such an order offered the best means of achieving that objective. I ask the Committee to reflect on the implications of that. It would mean that a court in such a situation could be compelled to deal with an offender in a way it believed to be second best. In some cases, that could well result in an offender going to prison simply because, under the proposed amendment, a useful alternative had been withdrawn, which is not a scenario that I find attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 31 would allow restriction of liberty orders to be made only where a custodial sentence would otherwise be imposed. I make no secret of the fact that I hope that orders will be used as alternatives to custody in appropriate cases. The Bill's purpose is to ensure not only that the most dangerous criminals remain in prison for as long as they are a danger to the rest of the community, but that minor offenders should not be sent to prison when that can be avoided. We believe that the orders will be used as alternatives to custody; that is the impression that has been gained during the pilot schemes south of the border. I prefer discretion to be left with the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading, both the Minister and the Secretary of State said that the orders would be seen as alternatives to custody. During our discussions with social work departments and others, we were urged to probe to find out whether they will be used only as alternatives to custody. Will the Minister clarify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the best of my knowledge, the disposals could be used in conjunction with other measures. If, for example, someone receives community service, we would not rule out a concurrent restriction of liberty order, depending on the circumstances of the offence. We do not wish to limit the discretion of the courts, but we want to ensure that minor offenders are not sent unnecessarily to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment No. 80, there may be cases where a court believes that a restriction of liberty order is the most appropriate disposal even though imprisonment is not the most likely alternative. Again, I would not wish to close off the restriction of liberty order option; in those circumstances, a court would be forced into taking what it considered a second-best course of action. I would wish to leave the courts with discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I came next to amendment No. 29. Scottish legislation on probation orders and community service orders contains provisions to specify that such orders are not available if the sentence for a crime is fixed by law. Such an order is not available to an offender convicted of murder because the sentence for murder is fixed by law. I see no case for the provisions of restriction of liberty orders to diverge on that point. Certainly there could be no question of a murderer being subject to a restriction of liberty order immediately following conviction. At that point he would, of course, have to begin serving his sentence of imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, hon. Members may envisage the use of restriction of liberty orders or something similar for offenders who, for example, had been released on licence from life sentences, so that their movements could be electronically monitored. That may be worth pursuing in the future, once we have experience of the operation of the restriction of liberty order as a disposal of first instance, but not before we have had the evidence of pilot schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 30, 78 and 82 seek to prevent the disposal being used by the district courts. Such a restriction would be out of keeping with existing legislation—for example, of probation orders and community service orders. We have no plans to include district courts initially in pilot projects, but I would not wish to close off the possibility of including them later. After all, district courts have the power to send individuals to prison, and a disposal that would avoid that in suitable circumstances should therefore not be denied them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a potential alternative to custody. I stress the fact that such an alternative is offered to offenders because offenders could always refuse to consent to the making of an order. That is a significant point. Of course, if the Secretary of State ever did decide to prescribe district courts, he would have to do so by regulation subject to annulment by Parliament. I suggest that that would be the proper time for Parliament to consider whether the restriction of liberty order should be a disposal available to district courts. It would not be sensible to rule out that possibility now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the restriction of liberty order will offer a useful new disposal to the courts and that on its introduction, its value will be carefully assessed. It is not right to restrict the courts and the cases in which such orders are made available. The amendments would have the effect of restriction and I ask hon. Members to withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to believe that a restriction of liberty order could be appropriate in some cases, but I wish to return to the question of shoplifting. In reply to an earlier question, the Minister said that a restriction of liberty order might relate to the specific shop in which the offence had been committed. If so, someone who thieved books from Smith's could have the run of Waterstone's. Those who had thieved clothes from Debenhams would then have the run of Marks and Spencer and British Home Stores. If the theft was of foodstuffs from Safeway, to the great delight of Tesco and other shops, the offenders would have the free run of those other stores.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That makes even less sense in the case of shoplifting foodstuffs, as many of those found guilty of the offence may be the only person in the family with responsibility for buying things. It is a nonsensical provision when there are alternatives to prison in such cases, including community service order and fines. Many who are found guilty of such offences are so ashamed that the court knows that they would never commit such an offence again; the public humiliation is very great for someone who has otherwise led a law-abiding life. That is particularly true of those well into middle age before committing such an offence. Will the English pilot schemes throw any light on that? I believe that the Committee will look extremely silly if it approves the measures on shoplifting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Lady a little information about the situation south of the border: the three electronically monitored curfew order pilot schemes have run since July 1995 and seem to have been much more positive than those on bail monitoring some years ago. I am not aware of any problems on the technological functioning involved. So far about 200 curfew orders have been made, over 80 per cent. of which have been successfully completed or are ongoing. Fewer than 20 per cent. have been revoked because of the nature of the offender's misdeeds or because they were quashed on appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of orders reflects the significant pick-up in their usage by the courts; only 18 were made in the first six months of the trial period, but ten times that number were made in the first 10 months of this year. Only part of the increase is due to additional courts being brought into the pilot scheme; it seems more to reflect judicial confidence in the disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of restriction of liberty orders are best left to the discretion of the court, having heard all the circumstances of the individual offence; I cannot issue any guidelines for someone who has engaged in compulsive shoplifting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still a little concerned about the shoplifting issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). As a justice of the peace in a district court, I often saw minor shoplifters, middle aged women who have never before committed an offence. Such women may have returned once or twice, but were unlikely to offend over a long period; it was just a blip in their lives, so to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
I am also concerned by the effect the electronic tag might have on electronic equipment in shops. Assistants often do not remove the tag after one has bought a garment and all the bleepers in the store go off when one leaves; will that happen with the electronic tags? They might set off alarms in airports or in every store in the land, which will subject the wearers to ridicule. One has to remove keys and so on at airports; I wonder what effect the equipment will have on the existing equipment at airports, hotels and shops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an obvious reason for pilot schemes. There have not been any problems with the technology, but pilot schemes would establish whether that remains the case; if there were any problems, they would have to be taken into account before the disposal could be more widely extended. Tagging would be an appropriate disposal for shoplifters only where the offending was associated with particular shops; other disposals may be appropriate. It is not the only disposal available for shoplifters—it might or might not be, depending on the circumstances of the offence and how often the offender had committed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the signal given off by the electronic tags, is there not a restriction on the distance an offender can go from his or her house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The details of a particular restriction—the hours and distances covered—are all laid down in the order. The technology is highly effective and there have not been, to the best of our knowledge, any problems with it. But any pilot scheme would have to be carefully monitored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to do the Minister's job, but if that is the case, it means that individuals cannot wander around from shop to shop in town centres. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the terms of the restriction laid down in the curfew order and on the effectiveness of the technology.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On tagging for shoplifting, the Minister must be aware, having been at the launch of Operation Shopkeep, that there are 5 million retail thefts a year and 1·5 million people are apprehended every year, although only 50,000 come to court. Does the Minister intend tagging 50,000, 10,000 or 5,000 people? What possible difference will that make to the fact that there are 5 million offences every year, with an average cost to the retailer of £42 and a cost on a scale meaning that every one of us in this country pays £90 a year? What nonsense is the Minister talking about tagging a couple of hundred or a couple of thousand people in the face of 5 million offences? It is a joke.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The points made by the hon. Members for Maryhill and for Paisley, North are valid. Some offenders may be elderly people who have committed the offence on relatively few occasions for which imprisonment would not be appropriate.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been arguing the case for restriction of liberty orders on the basis that they are an alternative to prison, but they are really an alternative to alternatives to prison. Alternatives to prison already exist. The Minister knows that football hooligans or petty thieves should not be sent to prison and the courts have means of dealing with such offenders. There are probation orders and community service orders, for example. The new sentences being introduced by the Minister are an alternative to the alternatives that already exist, so they do not add substantially to the array of sentencing already available to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Restriction of liberty orders will not prevent crime. They will not stop an offender reoffending because they are limited to 12 hours in any one day and for the other 12 hours an offender can do as much as he or she likes. The tag will be turned off and no one will be able to monitor where the offender is at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that an offender is electronically tagged and monitored for the set period means that nothing else will be done with him. He will not be required to undertake voluntary work or to do anything for the community; he will merely be locked up in his house for long periods every day of they year. That is a destructive way of dealing with offenders and not something which the Committee should allow to happen. However, since it looks like it will happen, we had better deal with some of the problems that will arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 110 requires the court to ascertain certain information from an offender before imposing a restriction of liberty order. The amendment spells out the requirements, which are very reasonable. The first is that it must be ascertained where the offender lives and whether he or she intends to move during the currency of the order. If the order if imposed for 12 months and the family moves, it would be unfair if the offender were left behind—it would be even more unfair if the new people who moved in discovered that the offender was there, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that electronic tagging requires a phone and a modem to be installed in the offender's house, so there are public expenditure implications. Some good may come out of it because many offenders cannot afford a phone, but they can have a phone installed at the state's expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When this phone is installed, what will happen if the offender does not pay the bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that he would be sent to prison—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] But the Minister probably has not thought that one through yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious point here. Council tenants may have been waiting for years to get a new house and then, during the currency of the order, they may be offered a new semi in a better part of town. It is important that they should be able to move and that the electronic paraphernalia should move with them.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
They should not be restricted to the one particular house stated in the order. Nothing in the Bill suggests that the court has any flexibility to enable it to adjust an order if the offender's circumstances change. The Minister must address that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second piece of information that amendment No. 110 would require the offender to provide is whether he attends school or any other educational establishment. This morning, the Minister suggested that the Government intend the restriction of liberty orders to apply to young offenders—people below the age of 16. So the order may interfere with their ability to attend school. For example, some school activities take place on Saturday, and it is important that offenders should not be prevented from, for example, playing for a football team on Saturdays. Taking part in sporting activities and having the honour of playing for the school team can help an offender to get out of the habit of offending. It would be inappropriate if offenders were electronically tagged and prevented from leaving their houses on Saturdays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same argument applies to anyone who works. The Government want to defend people working in excess of 48 hours a week, which often means that people have to work on Saturdays and Sundays. So precisely when will they be detained in the house under such orders? The courts must be aware of the circumstances of the individual offender—where he works, what hours he works, and his pattern of work activity—and take those factors into account before imposing, willy-nilly, a restriction of liberty order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final piece of information required is the offender's religion or beliefs because those beliefs may require him, for example, to attend a church service on Sunday. It would be unfair if an offender were prevented from going to church on Sunday. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not hear what the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland said from a sedentary position; it is probably just as well. It is important for some offenders to go to mass on Sunday. Last week, I attended a football match, where four fifths of the crowd, who may have offended when they got home that night because of the result, actually do go to mass on Sundays, which is a good thing—and that is just the Rangers supporters!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the courts take account of such details and that allowance is made for people to attend church and to save their souls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 33 would require the offender to obtain legal advice before agreeing to comply with an order. The Minister probably understands this, but I am not sure that other members of the Committee fully understand that a restriction of liberty order cannot be imposed on an offender who does not agree to it. The Bill states, on page7:
	<br><q><p>"and the court shall not make the order unless the offender agrees to comply with its requirements."</p></q>
In a sense, that defeats the Minister's argument about football hooligans. If football hooligans must agree to being electronically tagged on Saturday
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
afternoons, most of them will say, "No, I would rather be free on a Saturday afternoon to go and watch my football team." If the offender does not agree to the conditions of the restriction of liberty order, the court cannot impose it. It is important that the offender should obtain legal advice before agreeing to an order because the full implications of such an order may not be obvious. We are not talking about serious criminals but about people whom the Minister described as petty criminals—people who offend in a minor way—who may not fully understand the law in all its glory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 34 would require the order to be agreed to in writing. In other words, the police or the court would not be able to say, "Just nod your head if you agree" and accept that as the offender agreeing to the order. Offenders have to state clearly in writing, after taking advice from their lawyers, whether they agree to the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 37 would ensure that a copy of the restriction of liberty order would be provided to offenders so that they fully understand what is required. Amendment No. 38 would ensure that lawyers are also given a copy of the order so that they can go through the restrictions and explain them fully to the offender. It is a problem that many offenders who are handed a complex restriction of liberty order do not fully understand it and may therefore be in breach of the order without knowing it. They need someone to sit down and patiently explain it to them. The court will not have time to do that so it is important that solicitors meet offenders and explain in detail the restrictions of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why these detailed amendments cannot be accepted by the Minister. It seems clear that we cannot work the system unless all of them are accepted. I will wait to hear what he has to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39 would allow the court to hear representations from those who will be affected by the restriction of liberty order confining an offender to his home. Obviously that will involve offenders and their solicitors, but also those who will have to live with the offenders. A young offender restricted to his house might have a mother, father, brothers or sisters who will have to live with him while he is locked up there, perhaps for 12 hours a day for an entire year. An adult male offender living with his wife could have a history of wife beating. Surely it would be in no one's interest to use a restriction of liberty order to confine a man who beats his wife to his home for 12 hours a day for a year, because that might give him feelings of frustration and rage which he may take out on his wife.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sedentary interventions are affecting what could have been a very good speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that if offenders are restricted to their homes for long periods of time, tensions will build up. After many experiments carried out in England, some social work departments sat down with offenders and asked them what it was like to be subject to a restriction of liberty order. One young man replied:
	<br><q><p>"When you're inside, you're inside."</p></q>
	<br><q><p>By that, Sir James, he meant prison. If you are sent to prison, you are sent to prison: if you commit a crime, you do your time—that is it. But he continued:</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"With the family, when you're around the house with your tag and getting fed up, you tend to take it out on the family and end up getting kicked out or something."</p></q>
That is a young man who was restricted to his home for 12 hours a day perhaps for three months, six months or nine months. He ended up taking it out on the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That young man was not especially violent, but what would happen to football hooligans? The very idea that someone who indulges in football hooliganism, who throws bottles or bricks, who swears, curses and kicks fans from the opposing side, should be restricted to the house with all his family for a whole year is mindboggling. We should consider the consequences that may arise from the orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the court considers imposing a restriction of liberty order on any offender, it should take the time to talk to the family which will also be affected by it. The family should have the chance to make representations to the court before the court decides what to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final amendment is amendment No. 76, but I do not have notes on it. It stipulates that the information that has to be gathered about the restriction of liberty order should be gathered only by groups willing to do that. For example, a restriction of liberty order will involve a report about whether it is suitable for an offender. Someone will have to visit the offender's home to see the circumstances there and report back to the court about whether it would be suitable to impose a restriction of liberty order in that case. Scottish local authorities have made it clear that they do not want to become involved in such work. They think that it will interfere with the rest of their work. They are therefore unwilling participants—they do not want to be involved with restriction of liberty orders or with electronic tagging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To date, are not local authorities employed by the courts to assess questions objectively? Electronic tagging involves subjective decisions, which is not consistent with local authorities' usual role of being objective and of giving professional advice to the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a very fair point which COSLA also made to several Opposition Members. It said that it is deeply worried about the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
implications of clause 4(6), which states that when a court requires a person to remain in a specific place or places, it must
	<br><q><p>"obtain and consider information about that place or those places, including information as to the attitude of persons likely to be affected by the enforced presence there of the offender."</p></q>
Social workers do not want to do that. The Government would be ill advised to force social work departments to carry out the investigations that are proposed in that subsection. That is a serious point. If social workers are unwilling participants in the procedure, it is likely that the job will not be done as well as it otherwise could have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the meeting on Monday with COSLA, one of my hon. Friends raised the possibility that because social work departments are, by and large, in opposition to restriction of liberty orders, they should submit a report that says, "This offender is unsuitable for a restriction of liberty order." To be fair to local authorities, they immediately dismissed the proposal. They said, "We might not like the proposal and we might not think that it is a wise thing to do, but we will have to do what is required of us by the courts. We shall make an objective assessment of the circumstances affecting that person. Based on that assessment, we shall make the recommendation to the court even if, in our heart of hearts, we do not think it appropriate. We shall have to consider the criteria that will, no doubt, be laid down by the Minister. If the criteria apply, we will have to recommend that the offender be given a restriction of liberty order."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was apparent in earlier debates is also apparent now: the Government are not genuinely interested in advancing alternatives to custody. Much more beneficial alternatives to custody are already available to courts. The Government's proposal is a propaganda item: it has been dragged up to show that the Tories are doing something about the terrible levels of crime in this country over the past 17 years. They pretend that they have nothing to do with the fact that crime has been rising persistently, and they have advanced all kinds of new strategems for returning crime levels to what they were under Labour Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's suggestion of activity is all done by mirrors—their policies, including electronic tagging and restriction of liberty orders, do nothing productive with offenders; they offer no way forward that is better for the courts. In fact, those policies probably hamper the courts in their main task, which is to stop offenders re-offending. The best way to stop offenders re-offending is to work with them through community service orders or probation orders. That will ensure that offenders can live in the community as normal people. The worst thing to do is to treat them like lepers by locking them up in their houses for 12 hours a day, 365 days a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The maximum sentence available under a community service order is 300 hours. The Government propose to replace that with an order that applies for 12 hours a day, 365 days a year. I cannot multiply 12 by 365 in my head, but the total is much more than 300; the Government propose to raise the maximum period in which one can be restricted in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
one's home from 300 hours to a figure in excess of 4,000 hours. That is no good for anyone—not for the offender, the offender's family or the community. The offender is likely to be a much more dangerous person after the restriction of liberty order is lifted than he was before it was imposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on from what my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, I would like to make one or two points, particularly about the installation of telephones for people who are tagged. Who will be responsible for that installation and, if a young person is tagged, will the parents be responsible for the phone bills that follow? If those parents are unemployed or on low income, who will pick up the tab? If they do not pay the bill, will the phone be disconnected? Where would that leave the courts and the person who is tagged?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that my hon. Friend made about the ability to move house while one was tagged appealed to me because I thought that I might get my family tagged and move myself. We have not fully considered this matter and I am desperately concerned that the Government have not thought through the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When young people are tagged, who is being punished—the young offender or the parents of the young offender? "Parents" would probably mean the mother because nine times out of 10 I cannot see the father being willing to sit around for 12 hours at a time it the young person is under 16.

I can assure you, Sir James, that that two hours was a bigger punishment for me than it was for them and I was desperate to see the end of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little concerned, therefore, that we have not thought through the consequences on the rest of the family of these measures. They may place greater strain on a family that may already be under strain. Will the Minister respond to that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I offer a comment on amendment No. 110? The provisions of that amendment would affect the terms of section 12 of the English Criminal Justice Act 1991, which provides that the requirements of an English custody order should avoid any conflict with the offender's religious beliefs and with any other community order, and also avoid interference with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
work or school. Unless I have missed an earlier debate, I do not think that that point has been raised. There could be problems when a person's religious beliefs require him to be present at a defined location for a specified period of time. Will the Minister take account of that? As the legislation is copying the English legislation I cannot imagine why that aspect has been left out. If it is an oversight I hope that the Minister is willing to correct it and accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been raised which I should tidy up in answering the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to alternatives to custody, the impression from England—I say this to the hon. Member for Dundee, East—is that curfew orders are used mainly as an alternative to custody. They are not necessarily limited to twelve hours: they can keep an offender away from a place for 24 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Paisley, North asked about moving house. If a family moves house, the court can vary the order under section 245D. That matter is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked whether there was a comparison with community service orders. That comparison is inappropriate because such orders require offenders to work. Restriction on liberty orders do not require work and, in this respect, are entirely different. We do not propose to allow local authorities to monitor restriction of liberty orders. We do intend, however, that they should continue to assess the suitability of sentencing options in social inquiry reports as they do at present. That is extremely valuable to the court because the judge will have heard all the circumstances of the case, but will not know the offender's entire background until he has the report. It will assist him greatly in reaching the most sensible conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about responsibility. The contractor will be responsible for making the installation. The monitoring cost will not involve the offender in paying telephone bills for screening transmissions. The line can be used for monitoring only if it is installed for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the amendments about offenders' consent and legal advice, it is common in Scots law to require courts to obtain the offender's consent before making an order. I draw the Committee's attention to sections 228 and 238 of the 1995 Act, which make provision on probation orders and community service orders. We see no need to depart from the established procedures in the lone case of restriction of liberty orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about extending restriction of liberty orders to offenders. There are well-established procedures for copying orders to offenders. Sections 228 and 238 of the 1995 Act provide for probation orders and community service orders. Both sections make provisions about the delivery of copies by post. The various amendments aim to set those aside. Neither of the sections requires a copy of the order to be given or sent to the offender's solicitor as amendments Nos. 35 and 38 require. If the offender wants the solicitor to have a copy of an order, he can provide it himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On availability of monitoring arrangements, amendment No. 109 would prevent a court from making an order unless it had been notified by the Secretary of State that appropriate monitoring arrangements were available and was satisfied with the arrangements. Although the provisions of section 13(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 are necessary for the English legislation, it is unnecessary to reproduce them in this clause because its different approach already addresses the issue. Specifically, subsection (9) of prospective section 245A enables the Secretary of State to make certain by regulations that courts are empowered to make restriction of liberty orders only when appropriate monitoring arrangements are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of courts obtaining information before making restriction of liberty orders was raised. Although amendment No. 110 is clearly wellintentioned in all circumstances and against the background of our distinct legal system, we are persuaded that it would not be helpful or necessary to introduce a list in this context. We are following the practice of the last Labour Government whose community service legislation did not include a list of offenders' circumstances to take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will realise that section 12 of the 1991 Act states that the requirements in an English curfew order shall avoid
	<br><q><p>"any conflict with the offender's religious beliefs or with the requirements of any other community order".</p></q>
It also mentions avoiding interference with work or school. If those conditions prevail in England and perhaps Wales, why not in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to deal with that point. It is certainly not my purpose to interfere with anybody's religious beliefs. We have a good record of tolerance in Scotland. I will examine the hon. Gentleman's remark in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 76 deals with information taken into account for restriction of liberty orders. The amendment would appear not to allow the feelings of the offender's wife, children or relevant people to be taken into account by the court unless those people have previously told the court that they want to provide such information. The legitimate feelings of those people would be ignored if they failed inadvertently to notify the court beforehand of their wish to be considered. That would be inappropriate. I listened to hon. Member's comments, but I am not persuaded that their arguments are persuasive enough to lead us to set aside well established procedures or to introduce new requirements simply and solely on restriction of liberty orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider the point made by the hon. Member for Dumbarton, and with that assurance I hope that the hon. Member for Dundee, East will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely happy with the Minister's answer, particularly on amendment No. 76. He misinterpreted the intention of that amendment, which states:

A woman may be frightened of her husband and the only means that she may have of ensuring that he goes to gaol instead of being subject to a restriction of liberty order might be to refuse to give such information. The purpose of the amendment is to protect people who do not want an offender to be confined to their house for three, six, nine or 12 months, 12 hours a day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must consider seriously the circumstances of people apart from the offender who will be affected by the order. They will not have committed an offence and should not be punished. There is a danger that the courts may punish people who have committed no crime by making them live with an offender who may be very difficult to deal with over a very long period. That could lead to tragedies simply because the measure has not been properly thought out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister will assure me that he will examine the matter closely to ensure that the position of relatives and people who may share the offender's home during the period of a restriction of liberty order will be considered, I shall withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I had the impression that the hon. Gentleman was referring to something else. I thought that at least part of the intention was to enable local authority social work departments to refuse to comply with a request from a court to provide relevant information. I certainly reject the notion that it should be possible for a new disposal made available by Parliament to be set aside because of non-co-operation with it. That would be dangerous and unprecedented. If the hon. Gentleman can provide examples of relatives whom he believes would be unfairly treated, I shall consider the matter.

The Opposition have put on record our concern that restriction of liberty orders could seriously affect people who will in a sense be condemned with the offender. It will be not only the offender who will be affected by such an order, but the family and people who share the house with the offender. They will not have done anything wrong, so why should they be punished? The Minister has not thought the matter out and he must put on record what steps will be taken to defend people who will be affected by the order but who will have committed no offence besides being a friend or relative of the offender.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Once again, it seems that the Secretary of State has gone too far too quickly. He said that it is innovative to introduce restriction of liberty orders. Section 4(2) states:
	<br><q><p>"A restriction of liberty order may restrict the offender's movements to such extent as the court thinks fit".</p></q>
That seems reasonable. It is an innovation, but it respects the fact that the courts will probably respond, both in trials and in debates within the legal framework, in an attempt to work out when something is best, and when it has worked. They may, as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
discussion takes place within the legal profession, deal with many of the problems raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new paragraph 10 on page 8 of the Bill states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations vary the periods mentioned in subsections (2) or (3) above."</p></q>
So regardless of how the courts work on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis and develop professional practice, the Government may make yet another political foray into that practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that this is not the Government's intention—that they are simply writing in what has been written into every Bill for the past 17 years. We are well aware that the Government are attracted to putting enabling clauses in Bills. I often complained that the Militant Tendency in the Labour party wanted Bills to include enabling clauses so that it could tag on the end all the regulations that it wanted to them, thus appearing to leave discretion to another part of the constitution—the judiciary. It could then say that there would be legislation by political decision. That is what such enabling measures have become.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently I was a member of a statutory instrument Committee on the introduction of open-ended investment companies, the order for which was 75 paragraphs long. It proposed the introduction of completely new measures for the British financial sector to reintroduce bearer bonds, which were banned by this country after the war. That is the sort of legislation that Governments are empowered to introduce. The Law Society of Scotland has said that people have expressed concern about this, and states that it is
	<br><q><p>"of the view that these orders represent a considerable innovation in the range of disposals available to the courts. It is inappropriate in respect of such a new disposal to limit Parliamentary scrutiny in respect of the jurisdication of such orders."</p></q>
Clause 4(11) states:
	<br><q><p>"Regulation under this section shall be made by statutory instrument subject to annulment."</p></q>
—in other words, a negative resolution. The Government will not introduce a positive resolution that would be debated on the Floor of the House. An hon. Member would have to pray against a negative resolution in an attempt to create a debate, which would last for perhaps half a day, or for a couple of hours in a Committee room. It would demand a reaction by the House. The Government are again taking too much power by propelling this measure into judicial procedures in a threatening way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone has the right to express concern, as I have done. A positive resolution would at least give us some assurance that the Government would not sneak in a large raft of regulations telling the courts how to dispose of sentences, and when to use an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will take that on board and accept an amendment which, in the words of the Scottish Law Society, would ensure full Parliamentary scrutiny if the duration of orders needed to be changed. That would at least let us know whether the Government intended introducing longer or different orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

In that context, I had a letter today about the restriction of libery orders and electronic monitoring, and the question was asked whether those should be available not just to the courts but also to the children's panel for children's hearings. We were assured that consultation would continue until 4 January rather than 4 December, but we want an assurance that if the Government intend to allow children's hearings to use restriction of liberty orders, they will not be made by negative resolution or statutory instrument, but on the Floor of the House to allow proper debate and scrutiny of such an extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very important matter; there are grave concerns about the use of supervision orders and how they work and about the relationship between the young people being supervised and the social work department. Some are not carried out properly—there are cases in my constituency in which the social work department has decided to abandon the supervision order because the person being supervised will not cooperate, so the department just walks away from that individual. There may be a debate about restriction orders, but the Minister will, I hope, assure us that they will not be brought in by means of a statutory instrument. I hope that he will agree that we should consider amendments to the Bill on the Floor of the House or by means of an affirmative order that will automatically be discussed in the Chamber.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions of subsection (10) of prospective section 245A will provide useful flexibility. The amendment would remove that flexibility and I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman not to press it to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, if a matter is very important, an affirmative resolution is appropriate, but the orderruling power, which we are discussing, is in section 245A, subsection 10, and is subject to negative resolution procedure. The hon. Gentleman thinks that we should pilot this new disposal so that we can gauge its worth before full-scale implementation and that is precisely what we intend to do. It may be that those pilot schemes will highlight particular strengths and weaknesses and we may need to adjust the details of the provisions in that light. Subsection (10) would allow us to do that, in respect of duration and hours, by increasing or reducing them. Such changes would, of course, be subject to Parliament's wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is similar to a provision that Parliament has already made in respect of curfew orders in England, and I hope that the Committee would not want Scotland to have a lesser provision. The amendment is technically defective, and I could give my reasons for saying so, but that is not the main point. The proposal provides the necessary flexibility to make adjustments in the light of evidence from the pilot scheme and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say a word about the extension of the orders to children's hearings? Can he assure us that that will not be done using subsections (10) and (11)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say a word about under-16s? The arguments for making restriction of liberty orders available to young offenders are much the same as those relating to adults. They offer a non-custodial means of enabling the courts to punish offenders, to break underlying patterns of behaviour, and to protect victims and the public. The question is whether there are good reasons for denying the courts the ability to make such orders in relation to young offenders when they believe it to be appropriate. As the alternative could be imprisonment or detention, and particularly as the young offender would be able to withhold consent, it is not obvious that the option should be withheld. We shall await the responses to our consultation paper on children's hearings and electronic monitoring before reaching a final view. We shall, of course, take into account the views the hon. Gentleman expressed in this Committee. We shall not reach any conclusions until we have assessed the responses after 4 January.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must come back on this matter because the Minister has not replied to my specific question.

I want an assurance that should the consultation convince the Government that they should extend the restriction of liberty orders to children's hearings, that would not be done by a negative resolution and a statutory instrument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that that could not be done by the regulations because they allow a variation only of periods and their extension, not of classes of offender.

However, the provision would not be relevant to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 42, in page 8, line 14, leave out 'name' and insert `specify', and amendment No. 81, in page 8, line 19, at end insert—

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seek clarification about the sort of people who will operate the system. 'Person' could refer to anyone, however unskilled. It is important that a qualified person assesses the way in which the regulations are implemented. The amendment would substitute "supervising social worker" for "person". That would ensure that the person involved with an offender under a restriction of liberty order was professionally qualified, able to monitor and could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
undertake almost a pastoral role. We want to avoid the appointment of a person without skills or qualifications, who simply pops in, checks whether the offender is there and then wanders off. There should be some interaction to obtain more information to clarify whether any difficulties exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to a previous point, which dealt with dangers, possibly in circumstances of domestic violence. A qualified social worker would be better placed than an unqualified person to assess whether there were on-going difficulties in the home that might have resulted in domestic violence, or might lead to domestic violence in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to monitor the system because contracts might be let on the basis of the lowest possible tender. A company that made a bid might try to save costs by underpaying employees and recruiting staff with minimum or no qualifications. Like the Minister, I know that staff on security guard duties can be obtained for ridiculously low wages. We do not want such people to carry out the monitoring, but that might be the result of competitive tendering for the contracts. It is important that the Minister comments on the amendment. The next amendment—No. 42—is a consequential amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 81 deals with obtaining the consent of organisations to undertake the work. It relates to an earlier point about the willingness of social work departments and local government to undertake monitoring. The Minister should clarify his view. Does he intend local authority social work departments to undertake the work, or will monitoring and supervision, which require professional input, be let on the basis of the lowest possible tender?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that I shall examine the implications for relatives; to the best of my knowledge, there have not so far been any problems in that regard in the pilot schemes south of the border. I have agreed to consider that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 41, 42 and 81 would require all restriction of liberty orders to be monitored by local authority social workers and would give those social workers a right to refuse to take part. Such a restriction is highly undesirable and I ask the Committee to reject it. The monitoring of compliance with curfew orders in England is undertaken by two private sector firms, Securicor and Geographix. We too will wish, initially at least, to monitor restriction of liberty orders by electronic means and to use the expertise of such firms. The amendments would preclude that. I urge the Committee not to turn its back on the possibility that private sector firms may have skills and resources that could be of value in the criminal justice system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also urge the Committee not to accept amendment No. 41, which imposes inappropriate responsibilities on social work resources. As for the notion that local authority social work departments should be allowed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
to pick and choose which criminal justice disposals to co-operate with, I cannot think of any precedent for that in legislation. It is a highly dubious suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understand the purpose of amendment No. 42 correctly, it is intended merely to make a minor drafting change to new section 245B(2). That change would have little practical effect and in any event it would be inappropriate to make it. The persons who will monitor orders will have names and it is therefore appropriate for the provision to contemplate the naming of such persons, rather than the specification of them. Again, therefore, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond to the Minister's comments on amendment No. 41? As he pointed out, the amendments are mutually contradictory—but that is one of the joys of being in opposition. The amendment is saying that a qualified person should undertake the monitoring; while I accept the Minister's point that private companies, including private security companies, might contribute expertise to such work, the amendment would apply equally to such companies. Their personnel who undertook monitoring work would have to be appropriately qualified social workers. Does the Minister accept that we have a genuine anxiety about completely unqualified people being placed in the front line of such supervision? The firms he named undoubtedly have staff of ability and expertise in several areas, but private security companies also employ staff who have virtually no expertise at all, in any area. It would be inappropriate for those low-paid staff to be directly involved in monitoring supervision orders. We seek an assurance from the Minister that appropriately qualified staff, who will be able to monitor the situation meaningfully and to recognise any difficulties, will be involved in the front line of the monitoring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Restriction of liberty orders, as planned for the Scottish pilot schemes, do not need and are not appropriate for social work supervision by professionally qualified staff. If a court wants social work supervision of an offender's movements, it can already competently impose a probation order with specific, relevant conditions. When Parliament decides that a disposal is to be made available in order, for example, to protect the public, it is undesirable that the will of Parliament and public safety should be subverted by what would effectively be a right of veto. Although we have no plans to require social workers to monitor compliance, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments as a matter of principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that the clause makes constant reference to "the person"; the Minister said that Securicor monitors the pilot schemes. I understand that a "person" means an individual, not a company, and therefore that there might be a deficiency or error in the drafting of the legislation; or is the Minister saying that an individual from Securicor will be named? If that is so, if that individual were to move employment, another individual must be named. So if people have the commonsense to leave Securicor, which pays absolutely appalling salaries the matter must be referred back to the court. That seems a bit of a nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why will the Minister not accept that social work departments are likely to be more competent than Securicor in naming organisations which can then vary the person involved? Securicor is likely to go through many people in any supervisory period if it continues to pay the same wages and demand the same conditions of employment. That will be especially so when the European 48-hour legislation is implemented, under which people can refuse to work the hours that Securicor demands of its staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was appalled to hear the Minister say that the involvement of professionally qualified social workers was not required under the Scottish system of electronic tagging. I suppose that the Minister based that comment on the experience in England. However, I understand that only a handful of pilot projects have been undertaken in England and, in fact, they have not been completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister aware of the much greater experience in America, where there are 600 such schemes and where there has been a six-year study into their effectiveness? One of the key findings of that study is that the schemes are successful only when there is strong involvement and support from parole workers, probation workers and professional qualified social workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital to the success of the scheme that those who monitor offenders in their homes under such orders are properly qualified and understand the pressures on offenders and their families. They must be able to offer assistance, rather than just check whether people are where they should be. They must be able to provide the support and assistance that is required to make such schemes work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister says that it is open to the courts to impose probation orders alongside electronic tagging orders, but they might not do so; they are under severe pressure. I receive complaints daily stating that the procurator fiscal service is so underfunded in Dundee that procurators fiscal are handed cases two minutes before they walk into court. They do not have the time to consider cases properly. Under such pressures, the courts can make mistakes and miss out probation orders. The scheme will not work unless the people involved have experience of offenders and know what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Securicor is hopeless. In America, in four years, 7,000 offenders went missing from one electronic tagging scheme in Washington. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was called in to investigate where those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
offenders had gone to. I anticipate that Securicor is the sort of organisation that will end up in exactly that situation because of the low pay and the poor quality of training that it offers. People might well go missing because of the involvement of private sector companies of that type; they are not fit to ensure that the scheme runs properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before Tory Members race to the defence of Securicor, they should say whether they have taken consultancies from private sector companies who hope to wax rich on the back of offenders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A named individual from the company will be specified in the order. We would not nominate a person unless we were sure that he could effectively monitor the order. The Secretary of State will assess qualifications during the tender assessment. The aim will be to achieve best value for money and the qualifications needed will depend on the nature of the work undertaken. Social workers would not be qualified to undertake electronic monitoring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the best of my knowledge, there have been no specific problems, but any that may arise will do so during the pilot schemes. The role of the restriction of liberty orders—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just finish the point? The role of restriction of liberty orders should not be overstated. They are relatively simple and will not themselves involve supervision of the sort provided under probation and community service orders. As I said, the court can use probation and community service orders if it wants such disposals, but those that we are discussing are an additional option—they are an alternative rather than a replacement for other disposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the intention that the person named should be, for example, the managing director—or the divisional chief or the person who has overall responsibility—of Securicor, and not the individual who is in the front line? I am genuinely uncertain about that. Given what we said about the difficulties that might arise, our anxiety is that there should be some professional assessment of how the system will operate in practice, taking into account whether there are stresses and strains in the family, whether the individual is being driven to distraction or whether it might be best for all concerned that the scheme be drawn to a close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the proposal is simply that an individual will be in charge of monitoring whether the signals come down the line continually, there will not be the interaction that we believe to be essential. If the proposal is that the managing director of Securicor or some other firm is named, the monitoring will be several times removed, as it is unlikely that the managing director will be looking at the screens, reading the print-outs or dealing with the system in whatever way it is operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred several times to the private sector. Does that mean that a decision has already been taken in principle that the work will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
undertaken by the private sector? Do the Government intend to privatise the service before it has been created, which must be a first even for this Government? Will the Minister tell us the Government's position on those matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fallacy to assume that managing directors are always the best qualified persons in their companies to undertake highly skilled work, but the tender specification in the contract would obviously lay down the qualifications necessary to carry out the work. If restriction on liberty orders are implemented as planned, with monitoring undertaken by private firms, their consent will always be present through the conclusion of the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 81 relates to a different stituation, in which a public body is called on to monitor compliance. There are no plans to that but, if plans were to change in the light of experience, it would be inappropriate to permit local authorities to refuse to take part in monitoring. Other community disposals do not permit such a right of veto. I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the amendment, we assume that the service that the Government are about to create will be privatised. It is important that we obtain some clarification on how they intend to operate the system of the letting of contracts. The amendment proposes that the Secretary of State

Here, "those persons" could mean the firms involved. We also suggest that he consult with the Scottish Criminal Justice Forum and

Now that the privatisation of that important area of work is proposed, the public should know what responsibilities are being given to a private company.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 43 proposes dedicated consultation and notification procedures for the letting of contracts for monitoring services in respect of restriction of liberty orders. In so far as any such procedures are desirable, they are generally already in place. Where the proposed procedures are not in place, that is because they are unnecessary or undesirable, so I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is already common practice for the Scottish Office to publish the names of those tendered for a contract once it is let. The first requirement of the proposed new subsection is therefore unnecessary, unless it is intended to require names to be published before the contract is let. If that is its objective, I must say that that would be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning the amendment's second requirement, we have already consulted about the principle of the introduction of electronically monitored restriction of liberty orders. That matter was included in the White Paper, "Crime and Punishment". I see no purpose in performing that exercise again. The specifics of which company receives a contract is a management matter for the Secretary of State, not something on which consultation would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if that were not the case, I should not be inclined to accept such an ill-defined requirement. The amendment does not define with any clarity who is to be consulted, nor does it specify the purpose or subject of consultation; it appears to demand consultation just for the sake of it. I cannot support that. When we consult, we do so with genuine purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final requirement would be that we publish commercial information that there is no good reason to place in the public domain. The Committee should note that the Secretary of State routinely enters into contracts with the private sector for the provision of services, and monitoring procedures are already in place. Ultimately, of course, the Public Accounts Committee can inquire about the spending of public funds. I am confident that those general procedures are adequate and that no special provision is needed for contracts relating to electronic monitoring of restriction of liberty orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that the Minister dismisses in such a cavalier fashion our wanting public information to be in the public domain. That flies in the face of the recommendations of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration—normally known as the ombudsman—that there should be a tendency towards open government. It also flies in the face of the Government's published code of practice, which states that as much information as possible should be in the public domain and that Departments—I hope that this includes the Scottish Office, despite the naturally taciturn nature of the Scot—should make information available to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was concerned about the Minister's earlier comments about qualifications. He told us what he thought was not an appropriate qualification for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
someone to monitor the orders—he said that he did not think that a social worker qualification was necessary—but he did not specify what would be the qualifications. Would the qualification be the ability to know when an electronic monitoring device was bleeping faster than before, the ability to count the number of beats in the bleeping of a monitoring device during a minute, basic arithmetic, or the ability to count without the use of toes and fingers? We need to know more about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be serious, for some time, the Government have been resisting registration of the qualifications of people who, for example, perform gas installations. Only the company has to be registered with CORGI; people who are working for that company might not be qualified for gas installation. Complaints flood in every winter about work done badly because individual tradesmen are not qualified, even though the company is registered with the association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That makes my point well. We need to know individuals' qualifications. In particular, as paragraph (iii) of the amendment notes, we need to know the terms on which the contract has been awarded. If the company concerned made the lowest bid, and the process was therefore about who could monitor the largest number of people at the cheapest price, the public should know that. If base marks for the quality of monitoring have been set so that the reporting system is the condition on which the contract is let, we shuld know that too, If there is something else—such as the stature of the people who work for the company, so that the company can, if necessary, pursue and restrain people who break the order—we should know it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much more needs to be known. The Government are asking the public to take much too much in good faith by saying that some official in the Scottish office will write out the terms and conditions and that will give something of value to the process of justice. The Government have not proven their case through anything that the Minister has said. To dismiss us in such a cavalier fashion proves that the Government have not thought the point through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Council for Civil Liberties has advised that no pilot should start in Scotland until the trials in England are complete and have been fully assessed so that we can come to some conclusion on whether they were a worthwhile expenditure of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A probation order costs £2,000 to put in place and to run. One of the pilots in England cost £4,000 per offender. We need to know what we are getting for our money and what are the terms and conditions under which those who win the contracts are allowed to take them and their public money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to try to get the Minister to understand why we are concerned about this point. Information has been given me by my local social work department, and I should like the Minister to confirm it. It refers to the pilots under way in England, which have been awarded to private sector companies. During the first seven months of the pilots 37 orders were issued. Of those, four of the individuals concerned committed further offences within that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
seven months and another were brought back to court for breaches of the order. That means that 13 out of 37 orders broke down in seven months. That is not a good track record for the private sector companies that the Minister is telling us we must accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A trial in the early 1980s dealt with defendants on bail. The trial was meant to last six months, and private security firms were again awarded contracts for electronic tagging schemes. They were supposed to deal with around 150 offenders over six months. In fact, only 50 were dealt with. Of those, 11 offended while on bail and another 18 violated bail conditions while they were electronically tagged. That is a failure rate of 58 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private sector has been given contracts for pilots and they have an abysmal record. It is not good enough for the Minister to yawn, as he is now, and to say that who gets the contracts, and what the terms and conditions are, is a management decision for the Secretary of State for Scotland and of no concern to anyone else. It is not good enough to say that that is nothing to do with the people in the criminal justice system—the social work departments, the judges, the sheriffs. It is not good enough to say that it has nothing to do with the community and that it should be left to the Secretary of State to hand out the contracts to his pals in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters are important to lots of people in Scotland. Public money will be spent on the schemes. Everyone has a right to know who has been awarded the contracts and the terms and conditions of those contracts. Private sector companies' track record in this game is abysmal. The Minister's suggestion that there should be a handover to the private sector again flies in the face of all the evidence from Government pilot schemes—current ones as well as those of the 1980s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to the concerns expressed by the hon. Members for Govan, for Dundee, East and for Falkirk, East that monitors should be supervised. Perhaps the hon. Gentlemen are concerned most about how the monitoring firms carry out their contract. That will be dealt with in external research, evaluation and independent audit of the pilots. However, that is a little different from the purpose of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that open government is desirable. However, we also need to take account of commercial realities. That is a difficult balancing act. Scottish Office procedures in relation to the letting of contracts are complex and involved, and fill an entire manual, but I shall summarise them briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the assumption that the contract value will exceed the European Community threshold, there would be three main phases: invitation to tender, tender and valuation, and the contract award. When inviting tenders for contracts above the public procurement thresholds, the Scottish Office publishes a contract notice in the 	<i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i>. An invitation to tender is prepared, providing tenderers with a specification of the service to be provided and the terms and conditions under which the contract will be awarded. The invitation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
specifies a closing date and at that time tenders are formally opened and recorded. They are then assessed and evaluated against pre-set criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be wise, prior to the receipt of tenders, to announce to tenderers who else was tendering. That could lead to collusion and affect adversely the competitiveness of the bids. Nor would we want to release the information once the tenders had been received. That would reduce our ability to obtain added value or advantageous terms during post-tender clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the tenders have been set, and the best identified, the contract is awarded. A contract award notice is placed in the 	<i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i>. The notice gives the name of the supplier, the number of tenders received, the range of prices tendered and the criteria for award of the contract. We may also publish a list of those who tendered, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East would like. Any unsuccessful tenderer is entitled to a debrief on request. We should not want to publish the terms of the contract. Companies doing business with the Scottish Office might, for example, have included in the tender items that would affect intellectual copyright, or their commercial position, or other contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The genuine secrets in the Scottish Office are not so much political as commercial, and that has been so for many years. I hope that I have satisfactorily answered the points that were raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the Minister has not covered certain matters. He must accept that with regard to letting contracts the present context is different from that of simply building a motorway or cleaning the bins. Individuals and their liberty are involved and the public are entitled to greater openness about this matter than perhaps they are on some others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to move away from the idea that it is acceptable simply to publish the list of tenderers after the contract has been let. It seems important, when individuals and their liberty are to be let out to the lowest bidder—particularly under the potentially EC-wide contract—to maintain a degree of openness and consultation about the kinds of organisation that will be deemed to be acceptable to perform the contract. For example, would an application from Mafia Warders Ltd. of Italy be deemed acceptable? Would not public discussion be legitimate if known criminals were involved in some of the organisations that inquired after tender documents? Is that not a subject that could quite legitimately be discussed publicly? I understand the Minister's reservation about commercial confidentiality, but we would be looking first at whether firms were fit and proper organisations to be given these serious responsibilities. A degree of discussion with, first, the Scottish Criminal Justice Forum is appropriate in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, to a degree, the Minister's point about commercial confidentiality of contract. I certainly accept his points about intellectual copyright. However, it would be appropriate for the Scottish Office to undertake to publish output measures and the basis upon which the contract has been let. Without necessarily making a clear assessment of the process, it would be able to produce documents on product, showing how the contract would be monitored, how it would be assessed and what it was meant to deliver. It would not say how it would deliver, what the mix of staff would be or give detailed costings as those are matters of commercial confidentiality. The public has the right to expect to be told by the Government what the contract specifies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the increasing amount of performance criteria that we are demanding from schools, social work departments and hospitals, it seems appropriate that the Government should provide equivalent output measures for such a contract. The Government should not be able to hide behind the excuse of commercial confidentiality to avoid supervision of a particular area of work that is still their responsibility even though it has been let privately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 83 would enable a person who admits to breaching the order to provide a reasonable excuse as a defence. The example that was given to me the other day was of a person restricted to his home for 12 hours a day. If the flat below him caught fire, causing his flat to get exceedingly hot, it would not be unreasonable for him to leave the premises even though it would breach the order. That should be allowed as a defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to assist the hon. Gentleman by telling him that I am pleased to be able to accept amendment No. 83, in principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 45 seeks to provide the opportunity to challenge the evidence being provided—as does amendment No. 46, with which it should be considered. It seems important that, if necessary, an individual should be called by the court to provide that evidence and to be questioned. It should not simply be a print-out, which could not be challenged. Amendment No. 49 is a consequential and probing amendment, and amendment No. 50 ties in with it. I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I am pleased to be able to accept amendment No. 83 in principle. Unfortunately, I cannot be so positive about the other amendments in the group because they would weaken the provisions relating to evidence and to proving breaches of restriction of liberty orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that amendment No. 83 usefully spells out—as we already do in community service legislation—that courts should not punish breaches if the offender has a reasonable excuse for committing the breach. This is a fair and just provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the standard of proof proposed by amendment No. 44 in relation to breach proceedings, I have to say that this would be entirely out of keeping with existing leglislation. I mean not just out of keeping with the English legislation on curfew orders, but out of keeping with Scottish legislation on probation and community service orders. I refer the Committee to sections 232 and 239 of the 1995 Act, which use the same formulation as the Bill. This formulation reflects the fact that, in breach proceedings, a person does not face criminal charges. I see no reason for the Bill to be amended to make exceptional provision in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 45 to 52 would remove the presumption of sufficiency that the clause attaches to a statement which will, in effect, be a print-out from equipment used to monitor the compliance of an offender with a restriction of liberty order. As hon. Members will be aware, it is an important feature of our criminal justice system that the Crown is required to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, all essential facts relating to the commission of an offence. I should, perhaps, explain that when a presumption of sufficiency attaches to certain facts, that presumption
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
does not adversely affect the right of the defence to challenge those facts. As in this case, the presumption does no more than enable the Crown to discharge the requirement for proof in relation to the relevant facts without the need for witnesses to be called to speak to those facts when the facts are not in dispute. I cannot over-emphasise the fact that the presumption does not prevent the defence from challenging the facts to which the presumption of sufficiency attaches. Where there is a challenge, the court will weigh the evidence in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Members will accept that brief summary of the law of evidence. I hope that Opposition Members will acknowledge that their amendments will not materially assist the defence in any case where proceedings are taken for breach of a restriction of liberty order. Instead, they will do no more than impose an unnecessary additional burden on the Crown by requiring it in every case, regardless of whether the facts contained in the statement are challenged or not, to call a witness unnecessarily to speak to those facts. I trust that they will now feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i>.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to address my remarks to the issue of electronic tagging. We must examine the scheme in detail because few answers have been forthcoming from the Minister and it is important for the public record that the Committee gives the subject some scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the scheme will not increase public protection. Although, on the surface, electronic tagging may look hard or tough, all it does is tell us where someone is, where someone is supposed to be or where someone is not. The underlying reasons are left untouched. We believe that, in such circumstances, probation orders and supervision orders could be more appropriate. It has been mentioned to us that curfew still exists under Scots law. Representatives of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities recently suggested that employing a few sessional workers to check the whereabouts of young individuals as if they were subject to curfew would be more appropriate than using an electronic tagging system, where there is no contact with the courts or social work depts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Electronic tagging has been used in Sweden, Australia and America, as well as in a number of pilot projects in England and Wales. National and international experience is that each scheme has inherent difficulties and questionable rates of success. One difficulty is that the world-wide take up of tagging has been low in comparison with other forms of community supervision. Tagging is more successful when used with offenders who have stability and personal support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
Any success that is claimed probably refers to offenders who, in the Scottish context, would be regarded as low or lower risk. For example, drink-drivers make up a high proportion of Swedish and American cases, whereas in Scotland such people are normally fined. Such offenders also have the most to lose—for example, unemployment, accommodation and so on—and they tend to be well motivated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such projects are claimed to have been more successful when used in the short term. In America, for example, 34 days of tagging are attached to an intensive programme of probation or supervision. In New Jersey, intensive probation means offender having 20 direct supervisor contacts per month—a ratio of 1:20. However, such programmes where found to be of limited use in that they recorded only an offender's absence, not his whereabouts. The notion that such schemes increased public safety is therefore misplaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housebound offenders pose additional risks to those women and children with whom they reside. Mention has already been made of cases of domestic violence and sexual abuse, where tagging restrictions would endanger such potential victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all the examples researched, the most frequently mentioned factor is the high cost of such schemes. Indeed, the cost is often so high that it does not compare with prison or community based disposal. English experience to date is that in the first nine months of the current pilot schemes, 65 orders were made for a total cost of £1.6 million, with a unit cost of more than £26,000. That compares with Scottish prison costs of about £500 per week and average Scottish probation order costs of less than £27 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an ethical problem, which has been mentioned by COSLA, which is the risk of tagging being used as a punishment, especially for young offenders whom the courts could not have imprisoned. COSLA's opinion is that that could be seen as breaching rule 55 of the European Rules and Community Sanctions and Measures, which requires that methods of supervision and control should serve the same ends as a communiy sanction per se. It states:
	<br><q><p>"they shall seek to contribute to personal and social development of relevance for adjustment in society".</p></q>
The use of a tag as a form of public stigmatisation will not, in its opinion, meet those requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill requires courts to use electronic tagging only in cases where it is believed to be the most appropriate disposal. The Secretary of State and the Minister have already said on the Floor of the House—the Minister in —response to the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham)—that tagging would be used only as an alternative to custody. The answer is most certainly that it will be. We and COSLA social work departments would like to think that its use will be confined to an alternative to custody, and the sheriff courts and the High Court should be supported in that. A definitive answer from the Minister would be most appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
As for the trials in England, my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East has mentioned the offences committed by offenders subsequent to orders being made. We should consider the experience of other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Sweden, the scheme combines electronic monitoring with intensive supervision; it was initially adopted in six probation districts. Offenders are sentenced to up to two months in prison but are allowed to apply to serve the sentence in the community under intensive supervision and electronic monitoring. They must be of fixed abode, have a telephone and be in employment or in education. Between 1 August 1994 and 31 July 1995, a total of 637 offenders were eligible under those criteria. Nearly 70 per cent. of them applied and 396 applications were approved; 50 per cent. of those were drink-drivers; 20 per cent. were violent offenders, whose offences were often drink or drug related; and 30 per cent. were convicted of other offences, including theft and refusing military service. By the end of that year, 311 of the 396 applicant and completed their supervision satisfactorily, 23 offenders had had their supervision terminated for reasons of misconduct, and 62 were still under suspension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Swedish experience is considered to be a model of success and it has been expanded to include anyone serving three months' imprisonment anywhere in the country, although it is believed that the maximum period of tagging should be four months. However, the level of technical faults was much higher than expected and the problem of false violations has still to be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pilot scheme in Australia commenced in April 1991. Figures for the first eight months suggest that the scheme was more effective for offenders released from imprisonment than for those on bail. Of the 78 people leaving prison to enter the scheme, 74 had started, 58 per cent. of whom had successfully completed the period of detention. Another 12 per cent. had either withdrawn from the scheme or been suspended, and the remainder were still subject to detention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the 47 offenders who were monitored while on bail only 12, or 25 per cent., had completed their bail and eight were still subject to detention; but 57 per cent. had their participation in the scheme cancelled. Not surprisingly, the bail scheme attracted negative comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned, we were discussing the international experience. We had finished with Australia and were talking about America, where there are 600 schemes in operation. It is difficult to obtain figures for the numbers of people involved in them. In 1994 an American Correctional Association survey gave the number as a little more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
than 24,000. That is a tiny proportion given the 3 million offenders who are undergoing supervision in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schemes vary widely, but four main groups of offenders seem to be covered: low-risk property offenders; drink drivers, bailees, and ex-prisoners on early release. Many of the schemes insist that the offenders are employed, and they are removed from programmes if they fail to find work. Many schemes are short and more than half the monitored programmes last six weeks or less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Monitoring and evaluation is not widespread, but where research has been conducted success rates seem to vary. Michigan claims 54 per cent. success while Florida claims 97 per cent. success. The Florida scheme concentrates on drink drivers and has a short time tag—the average time being 36 days. There have also been some spectacular practical failures. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, more than 7,000 offenders went missing under the Washington scheme over a four-year period and an FBI investigation was ordered into what had happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion that electronic tagging might be an alternative to custody is found in several schemes, but it seems not to be borne out by figures from the USA. A six-year study of effectiveness in America suggested that one of the main reasons for failure was the lack of staff resources in the probation service. One of the manufacturers is even reported to have said:
	<br><q><p>"Reliable equipment alone will not assure a successful programme. The involvement of professional social workers is the key."</p></q>
The manufacturer outlined in some detail the success factors, such as a clear, well-defined objective for using the system; strong involvement and support from the probation and parole service; careful screening of the participants using well-defined selection criteria; provision of support programmes; strong Government commitment and reliable equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some evidence of the likely criteria for success. Under the American programme, the offender must have a settled address with a telephone installed in the home; the offender should be employed; tags should not be used for offenders with a history of violence in the household. Tagging works best for those offenders who already have some internal control and just need an extra nudge. That system is supported by findings in Sweden, where three criteria for success emerged: tagging works only if it is for a short period, the offenders are well motivated and have a stable life, and it is part of a treatment programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have misgivings about the Government's proposal because it has not been thought out. They should take into consideration that the review of pilot projects elsewhere suggests that electronic monitoring is often ineffective, ill-focused and less than reliable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the schemes that work most effectively display some common characteristics. Those characteristics include a short monitoring period, the targeting of offenders with a stable home base, the targeting of those with secure employment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
and economic independence and those who are well-motivated to comply with the system, and the combination of electronic monitoring with other forms of supervision.

As has been said, the anticipated cost of electronic monitoring is excessive when compared with other community-based disposals in Scotland. As far as we can determine, the Government anticipate that the total running costs for two to three years will be £1.5 million. If there are 100 orders per year for two years—that is more than in the English pilot schemes—the cost per order will be £7,500. Over three years, again with 100 orders per year, the cost would be £5,000 per order. In both cases, those costs substantially exceed probation costs of £1,717 and community service costs of £1,321 per order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that information and the Government's failure to provide detail, it appears that the proposals will prove largely ineffective in Scotland for a number of reasons, not least because, as international experience has shown, the proposed duration of 12 hours per day for 12 months is far too long. Local authorities' experience suggests that more than 70 per cent. of offenders will not have the required employment or economic independence. The experience to date of supervised release orders does not suggest that there has been consistent or appropriate targeting in criminal courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the proposal is to be implemented, it will be a highly invasive disposal and the sheriff courts and the High Court should restrict its use to a dirct alternative to custody. I ask the Minister to ponder on my misgivings and tell us the Government's view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to answer the hon. Gentleman, who has cited much research evidence. I have no doubt that curfew orders have their limitations, but they have an effective role to play. They can provide a secure and accurate means of measuring compliance. Their full potential has yet to be explored, but the pilot schemes in England appear to demonstrate that the technology is reliable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's provision will permit restriction of liberty orders to be introduced in Scotland on a pilot basis. Even those, like the hon. Member for Dumbarton, who have doubts about the proposal's effectiveness cannot object to it being tried out in practice to establish whether it has a useful role to play. The aim of ensuring that minor offenders should be able to receive disposals other than imprisonment that would usefully fit their cases should not be lightly disregarded by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's financial memorandum specifies that we expect the two to three-year pilots to cost in the order of £1.5 million. Until those pilots are completed, we cannot estimate the cost of a fully fledged programme. The hon. Member for Dumbarton referred to the high unit costs of England's pilot projects. To an extent, that is inevitable because of their high fixed costs. Unit costs can be expected to come down as the number of orders increases and the fixed costs are, therefore, spread more widely. We should not paint too pessimistic a picture about initial high unit costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just explained the cost of the pilots in Scotland. In England, pilots were restricted to three areas only, and it was originally intended that they should run for just six months. Their budget was £1.4 million.

How will the Minister be able to run pilots for two to three years in Scotland at the same cost as they run for six months in England and Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be three pilots, and the plan is to have them in certain sheriffdoms.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same principle applies in the two cases. If pilots are spread more widely, unit costs will fall. However, I shall write to the hon, Member for Dundee, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is common ground between the Government and the Opposition on the need to provide the courts with a full range of community sentencing options. Offenders should not be sent to prison simply because of a lack of community disposals. Restriction of liberty orders should be seen very much in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton mentioned drink-drive cases—depending on the circumstances, many other options such as community service orders are often applied in relation to such cases. However, they too could be a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 will enable the court to restrict an offender's movements by requiring him either to be or not to be in a specified place at a specified time. If an offender breaches the terms of an order, the court will have the power to do that. A feature of the clause is that it will allow the offender's compliance or noncompliance to be monitored by remote means such as tagging. The nearest parallel are the curfew orders being piloted in Manchester, Berkshire and Norfolk. They appear to be gaining the confidence of the courts and the Magistrates Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Orders have been made usually for offences such as theft, burglary, driving while disqualified and possession of drugs. They have also been made in some cases of violence and the indication is that the orders are used as an alternative to custody, but it will be some time before full information on custody rates is fully analysed. I realise that just because such disposals are finding favour in other countries it does not automatically mean that they will be used frequently in Scotland, but I hope that the Committee will agree that we must not close our eyes to the possibility that they might be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</ol></p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 5 is important in terms of hospital directions and amendment No. 88 would ensure that hospital directions apply only to cases tried in the High Court. We consider that it is not appropriate for a hospital direction to be made unless a serious crime is involved. The Minister is aware that it is a hybrid order combining prison sentences with directions to hospital. It was originally proposed by a joint Home Office and Department of Health working party in 1994, chaired by Dr. John Reed. Reference to that was made regularly during the passage of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1992 because we wanted the same conditions in Scotland that existed in England and Wales. Sadly, this hybrid order will not do that. It appears that the rationale the proposals in the Government's White Paper, "Crime and Punishment", are primarily about the need to combine a punitive element with a hospital order. That was reinforced in the White Paper which made it clear that offenders would either stay in hospital until the end of their sentence or would be remitted to prisons to serve the remainder of their sentence if they responded to treatment. We do not believe that that is a proper approach. Therefore amendment No. 87 would ensure that a hospital direction is made only if a serious crime is involved. That remedy, if used at all, should be used only for indictable offences. the White Paper did not envisage orders being made other than for solemn cases and we are not aware of any dissent from that view, so we should like to have the Minister's explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 88 would ensure that hospital directions are not available for people who have been court-martialled, are civil prisoners, are fine defaulters or have been detained under the Immigration Act 1991. Hospital direction is not appropriate in those cases and that was again recognised in the Government's White Paper, "Crime and Punishment". The Bill fails to make that exception and we should like to have the Minister's comments on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall add a brief comment on both the amendments. Amendment No. 87 deals with a possibly inadvertent ambiguity in the drafting. The current phraseology makes the disposal apply to persons convicted on indictment in the High Court or in the sheriff court, but the words "on indictment" may be meant to apply to both courts. As the Minister knows, not all cases in the sheriff court are on indictment, where many summary cases appear. That is ambiguous, particularly in view of the way in which the measure is expressed in the White Paper, which could lead to much difficulty. As a lawer, I know to my cost that entire court cases can sometimes revolve around the existence or otherwise of a comma—and how much more conflict a potentially ambiguous phrase could cause. As it stands, the clause could mean that the disposal also applies to summary cases in the sheriff court, which did not seem to be the intention of the White Paper. The amenedment seeks to clarify that ambiguity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 88 is designed to clarify the extent of the exceptions because they seem to have shifted a little from the apparent intention of the White Paper. If it is absolutely the case that none of those exceptions are to apply, despite the indications in the White Paper, have the Government received anything during the consultation period that has changed their view on that, or is just an oversight?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considered the amendments carefully and listened to the views of hon. Members who spoke to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 87, I still cannot see the logic of allowing the High Court, but not the sheriff court, to consider a hospital direction; both courts already have the power to consider the difficult matter of when to impose a restriction order on someone who is to be detained in hospital. There is no benefit in preventing the sheriff court from considering the new option which combines mental health and custodial elements in one disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clinching argument in regard to amendment No. 87 is a simple matter of fact: if it is thought appropriate that the High Court should consider a hospital direction, which must be the inference one draws from the amendment, it is relevant that about two thirds of all sentences of imprisonment imposed by the High Court are for periods of five years or less. Clause 11 will, if passed, constitute the area of overlap with the sheriff's new sentencing powers in solemn cases. If it is appropriate for the High Court to consider a hospital direction in the context of, for example, a three-year prison sentence, how can it be inappropriate for the sheriff court to do likewise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I sympathise with the thinking behind amendment No. 88, the Bill as drafted already achieves the desired result by virtue of the first three lines of new section 59A. Virtually all the exclusions in the amendment are already made by virtue of the wording in clause 5:
	<br><q><p>"convicted on indictment in the High Court or in the sheriff court of an offence punishable by imprisonment".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross is right that indictments can relate to sheriff courts as much as to the High Court. The only exception would be those few offences in the service Acts which may in particular cases be tried in a criminal court; if the full trial takes place before the High Court or a sheriff court, there is no reason to preclude consideration of a hospital direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he does not expect the disposal to apply to summary cases in the sheriff court? The way that the phrase reads, as drafted, could make that interpretation possible. The point is simply about grammatical construction, as the clause reads:
	<br><q><p>"on indictment in the High Court or in the sheriff court".</p></q>
From what the Minister has said, I take it that he means that cases on indictment in the sheriff court should be affected rather than all cases in the sheriff court, but that is not what clause 5 says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Lady's point. The intention is that the direction should be available only when a conviction is on indictment either in the High Court or in the sheriff court. If the provision were meant to apply to summary proceedings in the sheriff court, the words "on indictment" would not be necessary. I am satisfield that the provision as drafted will achieve what we want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the first time, the Minister's compelling argument is too much for me and I will have to withdraw. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</ol></p></q>
No. 108, in clause 9, page 15, line 39, after `direction', insert—
	<br><q><p>'and shall be approved for the purposes of this section by a Health Board as having special experience in the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorder and the other recommendation, shall, if possible be given by the patient's general practitioner or another medical practitioner who has previous acquaintance with him.'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. Amendment No. 89 would require doctors making a report to give evidence in person to a court. In a matter so vital to the civil liberties of a patient, the doctor should be required to attend to justify his or her opinion and to be subjected to cross-examination by the defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 91 requires medical practitioners to confirm various details to the court. The doctor would have to have examined the offender within seven days of making the report and to have carried out separate examinations unless the offender or his nearest relative had agreed otherwise. The offender should be told of the right to separate examinations. The doctor should not be related to the patient or have any financial interest in the patient's admission to hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment mirrors section 20 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984, which provides that if an offender is to be sent to hospital, medical reports should be recent and the patient should have the right to separate examinations and should be told of that right. To protect against abuse, doctors giving medical reports should not be related to the offender and should disclose any financial interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 94 would require a social circumstances report on the offender's background before a hospital direction could be made. The social worker would have to recommend that a hospital direction should be made. The court needs social work input before making a hospital direction. The mental health officer is a social worker with special expertise and can report to the court on the wider context. As with civil detention, the officer can also give a view on whether a hospital direction is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 96 replaces lines 40 to 44. Details of a patient's disorder should not be included in a hospital direction but the court should notify them to the hospital and notify it of any matters thrown up by the social worker's report. There is a danger that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
confidential information on the offender's diagnosis will be made too widely available if it is spelled out in the hospital direction. Such information should be made available only on a need-to-know basis. Prison or police staff transporting a patient to hospital or to prison under a direction do not need to know the patient's diagnosis. The court should take it on itself to report to the hospital on the health and social circumstances of an offender for whom it considers a hospital direction appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 99 replaces the end of the clause. The court would be put under a duty to make further inquiries if it thought that a hospital order might be appropriate. Before the court sentences an offender, it should be under a positive duty to consider whether to make further inquiries into the offender's mental health, social circumstances or physical health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 allows the court to rely on the evidence before it, but the court should be able also to adjourn proceedings if it thinks further evidence is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 108 inserts a new requirement in clause 9. It would require that one of the doctors who recommended hospital admission was a qualified psychiatrist, and that the other was, if possible, the accused's GP, or another doctor who knew the patient. The court needs the best possible information before deciding to make a hospital direction. A well-qualified psychiatrist should be involved. The amendment would ensure that the doctor had special experience and expertise. The patient's doctor would know about his past behaviour and whether hospitalisation was appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments mirror the requirements for medical reports before a patient can be admitted under the civil detention proceedings of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make some comments that relate to the amendments and to the clause. I am worried about the clause's proposals for a hospital direction. How can a person who suffers from a severe mental illness, is deluded about reality, and believes that, for example, he is Jesus Christ or some historical figure—a common aspect of severe mental illness—be held responsible in a court for his actions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of mental handicap. If that is sufficiently severe, a person's ability to give evidence, to answer questions in self defence, and to understand the difference between truth and lies is doubtful. Whatever the crime, and the sentence it would attract if the person had normal mental capacity and did not suffer from a mental illness, treatment and care are required, not a sentence, even if part of it is carried out in a hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, will the Minister consider whether the clause is appropriate? He has experience of court cases. It is incredible that a mentally ill or mentally handicapped person should be expected to stand in the dock to account for or defend themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add my support for the amendments. I ask the Minister particularly to consider amendments Nos. 89 and 91.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
Amendment No. 89 makes a simple and straightforward point: to allow only written doctor's evidence to come before a court is wrong in such important cases. In proceedings that might have such an enormous effect on an individual, it is essential that any doctor who has an opinion should be available, especially to the defence counsel, for cross-examination. The Bill's phraseology is not satisfactory. The clause simply requires a written statement from a doctor who is not even present in court. I do not believe that "written evidence" would satisfy the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 91 deals with the facts and circumstances around the report, such as when the doctors make their reports in relation to each other, and when they are written up. It also covers the doctors' circumstances—for example, the possibility of their being related to offenders. If the Minister will not take account of amendment No. 91, that will strengthen the necessity for seriously considering amendment No. 89, so that doctors appear in court and are subject to questioning. We are considering decisions that will have long-term, far-reaching effects on an individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses make it clear that clause 5 deals with offenders who are described as
	<br><q><p>"being well enough to have stood trial."</p></q>
However those same defendants, who are allegedly well enough to stand trial, are also described as people who nevertheless may be
	<br><q><p>"suffering from a mental disorder to an extent that would warrant admission to hospital".</p></q>
If such people are suffering from a mental disorder, which the Bill describes as
	<br><q><p>"mental illness or mental handicap"—</p></q>
very general terms—.to the extent of requiring hospitalisation, it is questionable whether they are really fit to stand trial.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the hospital direction will send the person concerned to the prison hospital, not to a hospital outside the prison, whereas such people might better be dealt with entirely outwith the prison system, in proper psychiatric hospitals. I am worried that the procedure is not an alternative intended to send people to hospital, but an alternative to ensure that they go to a prison hospital. I want the Minister to make it clear how somebody suffering from mental illness or handicap is fit enough to stand trial and why such a person should not in any case be in hospital, so that the direction would not be needed. Would people be sent to ordinary or prison hospitals under such a direction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds just as nice if you say it quickly, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the clause is a badly drafted one, responding to a state of affairs created by the Government, who have allowed many people to leave pyschiatric hospital—in fact have often forced them to do so—to return to the community in inadequate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
circumstances. They include people who are schizophrenic, who, on stopping their medication, return to bizarre and disordered behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example of such behaviour occurred last week on Armistice day, when someone who was in need of care, attention and close supervision—I see from their gestures that hon. Members understand what I am going to say—attacked a minister during an open air service, slashing him from his ear to the side of his mouth. If his attempt had been accurate, he would have cut the minister's jugular vein by slashing his neck. Clearly, some people in society require more care than they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A mentally disordered offender subject to a direction under the Bill could be such a person. It could be someone who has not—but should have—been diagnosed previously and who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East has said, is in need of care and attention in a psychiatric hospital. Such a person does not need a custodial sentence. I am not sure how it will be possible to call the evidence of "two medical practitioners" to confirm that a person is mentally disordered under section 17(1) of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984, as the new section 59A(3)(a) of the 1995 Act would require, and then say that that person is fit to plead. The Government seem to want to create a category of people who are criminal in behaviour and disordered mentally, and yet are not unfit to plead and do not, therefore, need to be dealt with under the mental health legislation—sectioned, as we used to say—and sent off for treatment. I do not understand how the Government can square what they are trying to do in this case with reality, or with the nature of those people who were intended to be covered by the relevant section. The clause is a non sequitur—nonsense, like much of the Bill. I should like the Minister to explain from which disordered mind the idea came.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It did not come from any disordered mind. People who are unfit to stand trial are those who are unable to understand the charges, or to plead. Those who warrant admission to hospital are defined in the 1984 Act as being ill and in need of treatment. The two definitions are different and serve different purposes. Just as the hon. Member for Dumbarton has visited prisons in America, I have, on more than one occasion, visited the state hospital at Carstairs. Conditions there have been enormously improved over the years. The facilities have been upgraded at a cost of many millions of pounds and there is much more privacy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in Carstairs on Saturday afternoon and I agree that the facilities have been upgraded. The new extension is very good and the person whom I was visiting referred to the issue of privacy. I commend the Government on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have learnt a lot over the years and the increased privacy has relaxed tensions within the hospital. Not all the patients have always been patients. Some received long prison sentences during which their health deteriorated and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
they were referred as patients to Carstairs. When they recover, some may return to prison to serve the remainder of their sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maryhill asked what was the purpose of clause 5. It has strong justification and provides the courts in serious cases with a new disposal option which combines a mental health element—immediate dispatch to hospital while the prisoner's need of treatment warrants that—with a criminal justice element—a sentence of imprisonment. Let us not pretend that no court to date has ever been faced with a case in which it considers that such a combination would have been appropriate had it been available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of case that leaps to my mind is when a child is murdered by someone who is mentally ill. There are two considerations: the treatment of the offender as a patient and the protection of the community. At present, in difficult cases, the court is faced with a dilemma. It may opt for purely mental health disposal—a hospital order with or without a restriction order because the offender is in need of immediate hospital treatment. The risk then is that after recovery the offender is back in the community years before a co-accused who was entirely well at the time of sentencing and is serving a long prison term. The alternative is for the court to set on one side the offender's evident need of immediate hospital treatment and send him to prison, leaving it to the Secretary of State to transfer him to hospital after his arrival in prison. A minority of prisoners in Carstairs had been transferred there from prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that neither of the existing options—one entirely a mental health disposal and the other entirely a custodial one—is satisfactory when the court's view is that some combination would be better. The judges, who are sometimes prayed in aid as opposing everything that we have to say, welcomed the proposals when we outlined them in the White Paper in June. I do not believe that they would welcome them if there were any substance in the suggestion that we are facilitating punishment of the mentally ill, and that is certainly not the case. Clause 5 will allow the courts to combine the two elements when they consider that to be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is describing a situation when the immediate need of the offender is to go into hospital to receive treatment for a mental disorder and, as soon as he is cured, to return to prison to serve the rest of the sentence. What incentive is there for an offender to be cured in hospital if he knows that he will then be banged up in Barlinnie, Perth, or somewhere else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends what the offender has done. If he has killed a child and is liable to do that again, it will depend on whether he was sane at the time of the offence or the trial and when his health deteriorated. All we are saying is that all the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
circumstances should be properly taken into account and the combination of options may be relevant in some cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East referred to the tragic Scourie case. I am reluctant to discuss individual cases, but I understand that the person who attacked the minister has been admitted to hospital. It is not for me to say whether matters will be taken further, but I shall be very interested to know and I shall ask for a report on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are to understand that if the clause had been in force, someone who had received treatment could have ended up serving a prison sentence after finishing a period of treatment. At the moment they are returned for treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This goes back to the basic point that I made earlier. When an individual has carried out a dangerous act, the question arises whether he should be treated solely as a patient or, if he is going to recover, whether an element of custodial sentence should be applied in order to protect the public. That depends on the circumstances of the case. I am not making a statement about the Scourie case, because I do not have available the full information, although I shall seek to obtain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to what has been said about the amendments. Amendment No. 89 would disallow a court from considering any written evidence from the doctors. That would not be sensible. The courts should continue to do as they do now: consider written medical reports and, if they so wish, ask the authors to appear in person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no advantage in the way in which amendment No. 91 seeks to specify how recent the medical examination should be; it wrongly assumes that the evidence presented will have emerged from a single examination by each doctor. We have so far relied and should continue to rely on the court's good sense and ability to discern whether the evidence before it is up to date and has been properly obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to amendments Nos. 94 and 96, I do not agree for a moment that whether a court should order a person's detention in hospital for treatment purposes should depend on the person's social circumstances or the views or veto of a mental health officer—that is, a local authority social worker. That decision must be reserved to the court on the basis of expert medical evidence as to the degree and nature of the person's mental disorder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 108 would place the views of a patient's general practitioner or a doctor who already knows the patient—even if that doctor has no experience of diagnosis of mental disorder—on a par with doctors who have considerable expertise in the field and are either approved under the mental health legislation or by virtue of the fact that they work in the hospital to which the person may be sent. We believe that that cannot be right. The court must have available the best and most expert evidence on which to base its decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
A court considering the imposition of a first sentence of imprisonment on someone must already obtain appropriate information about the person's circumstances and must consider any information before it on the person's mental condition and the like. Amendment No. 99 unnecessarily requires the court also to consider whether it should obtain further information about mental condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I express the Committee's sympathy to the minister who received that devastating and totally unpredicted attack—nobody could have foreseen it. That is the kind of situation we want to do everything in our power to avoid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explore further the case that he cited of an adult who murders a child? If a person murders a child knowing what he was doing and knowing that it was wrong, clearly that person is fit to stand trial—as far as I am concerned, a heavy sentence would be entirely appropriate. If, however, someone kills a child because voices in his head tell him that it is a good thing to kill a child, how can that person be fit to stand trial at all, with whatever medical back-up? That is what I do not understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has a very good point. If a person kills a child and is found to be insane, that is not a guilty verdict and the person will go to a mental hospital. If that person makes progress over the years, he or she may eventually receive a conditional discharge and an application may be made in future years for an absolute discharge. We are considering now whether the mental health of a person in such a situation could deteriorate so that the person becomes a threat to the community, but for the moment we believe it fair that a court should be able to make a joint disposal where appropriate, both to protect the public and to serve the best mental health interests of the individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware that recently, many press cases have suggested that there is great concern in the community about people who have committed horrendous crimes, who have been treated as mental patients and who have then been released back into the community under community care programmes? Is not that something with which we must take great care?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was explaining to the Committee—I made an announcement about this to the Scottish Grand Committee in the summer—we are considering that matter. Obviously, an individual who commits murder is subject to life licence and can be recalled to prison at any time. If someone who has killed someone is mentally ill, is found to be insane and is absolutely discharged into the community, there is no power of recall. That is something that we are currently considering. We have not yet reached conclusions, but we believe that the provisions offer an additional safeguard to protect the community where a person may be a substantial danger to it. A prison sentence as well as treatment as a patient could well be a sensible disposal, bearing in mind the interests of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not sure why the Minister believes the provision to be necessary. The courts have for as many years as any of us know about had the choice between deciding that someone is sane and fit to plead, in which case they are accused of a crime and take part in a criminal trial, and considering a person insane and unfit to plead, in which case they are sent to a secure hospital. The clause seems to introduce the possibility of finding someone neither insane enough to be unfit to plead nor sane enough to be fit simply to be sent to prison without any hospital treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How do we define that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. How do we define that middle way between being sane and insane? On what sort of advice will the court decide whether to go for a prison sentence, pure and simple, state hospital treatment, pure and simple, or the combination that the clause will provide? That is what I am driving at. Society has managed without that provision until now; what has changed that now makes it necessary? To pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie), it is entirely possible that someone who is still a danger to society could be let out too soon, but that is another issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can clarify what is a complex matter. The consideration is whether people understand the charge and are able to instruct lawyers and decide how to plead. If they stand trial and the court considers that they were so ill when the offence was committed as not to be responsible for their actions, they will be acquitted on grounds of insanity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering only people who are convicted—those whom the court considers fit and mentally well enough to stand trial and who were not insane when the offence was committed. Those persons may still be ill and in need of immediate hospital treatment. The court will in future be able to address that by sentencing them to imprisonment and making a hospital direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if two men commit an especially vicious murder and one man is completely sane while the other has a mental illness, the judge should be able to insist not only on a prison sentence for the man who is mentally ill, but that he should be treated in hospital. That is perfectly fair and sensible, and it will be a safeguard for the community to have both options available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to express continued concern at the Government's attempt to split hairs. Their wording of the clause provides a procedure, not a solution. No part of the Bill is aimed at providing a solution; it is about vote gathering and posturing. The clause is a Government attempt merely to produce another procedure. Everyone recognises the fact that there are those who are insane and unfit to plead; they are sent off to psychiatric hospitals for treatment. Now there are those who are mentally disordered. They are fit to plead; they understand the charges brought before them, but they have some sort of psychiatric disorder that can be named and treated. In theory,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
those people go for treatment; they are cured of the mental disorder, but they are still guilty of a criminal act and treated as criminals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggested earlier, although the Government disagreed, that many people fall into the category of those who will repeat heinous crimes for which there will be mandatory sentences. Those people are psychiatrically antisocial; they are just as disordered as any patient who has a named disorder for which there is a quick cure following a short-term stay in hospital. Who are the rest of the people if they are not in those categories?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister saying that there are the insane, the mentally disordered and the bad who must be treated as criminals, locked up in prison for a minimum of five sixths of their sentence and let out into society? They would be more of a danger to the community as they could have become hardened criminals, more likely to reoffend? The Government appear to be dealing with only a small number of people who, by repeating culpable homicide, vicious attacks or serious sexual attacks, display disordered behaviour. The Government want to deal with only those people on whom psychiarists can hang a specific label so that they can be given short-term treatment. Does the Minister not realise how deficient that is?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken a small step potentially in the right direction, but they have stopped short. Is that because of resources, or because the Government cannot stretch their imagination and their analysis to the point where they realise that, if they class someone as fit to plead but mentally disordered, they are beginning to describe the vast majority of people who are likely to be charged with two or more of the vicious, antisocial crimes to which the Government referred in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have much to add, except that in their representations the judges welcomed the flexibility provided by the provision. Judges welcomed the fact that the provision deals with cases where the court considers that imprisonment is appropriate—perhaps to protect the public—but the person involved is ill and in immediate need of treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision that enables hospital directions to be made will apply only where a person has been mentally well enough to stand trial, plead and be convicted. It simply enables the court to send those involved straight to hospital, rather than to prison. It gives the court increased flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the vast majority of such people are not mentally disordered, is the Minister saying that they are just bad? What is he saying about them? Obviously, he intends the category "mentally disordered" to include a small number of people who repeatedly commit vicious crimes, but what about the rest? Are they just bad people, or are they not also mentally disordered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Dougals-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the hon. Member for Dumbarton laughingly mentioned judicial discretion, but he had a serious point—the facts and circumstances of each case must be weighed up with the greatest care. Human beings cannot be fitted into a mass of statistics; each case must be considered on its merits. The intentions, motivation and the extent of mental illness must all be taken into account. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East must appreciate that that is not simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was involved in a High Court case where a girl whom I was representing shot her husband dead and the two doctors gave totally contradictory evidence. One doctor gave evidence of schizophrenia and the other gave evidence of self-defence. The evidence is not always consistent in such cases. The judiciary recommended that it was appropriate that a clause of this nature should be incorporated in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Minister is back on his hobby horse of judicial discretion, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i>.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 10, line 17, after 'that', insert (1)'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 90, in page 10, line 19, after `offender', insert—

	<br><q><p>(iii) treatment in hospital is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of his condition.'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We feel that the case has yet to be made for introducing hospital directions for any patients. The amendment's aim is to target those measures at specific patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would allow the courts to make an order for any offender who has a mental disorder. We wish that provision to be confined to those with psychopathic disorders. The hybrid orders that were mentioned earlier for psychopathic offenders were recommended by the Home Office group, which published the Reed report in 1994. It was mentioned that some hospitals were unwilling to take such patients because it was felt that their condition was incurable. A hybrid order would give them a chance to see whether the person could be helped and, if not, he could be returned to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the need for hospital directions has been inadequately made by the Government, at the very least, hospital directions should be limited to psychopathic offenders whose condition is curable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 36 of the Crime (Sentences) Bill for England and Wales only applies to people with psychopathic disorders. Why has not the same approach been taken for Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of a full review of services for mentally disordered offenders—such a review is urgently overdue—we do not believe that the case has been made for introducing hospital directions simply
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
for any patients. The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland has written to the Government strongly advising against such an introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hospitals are unwilling to accept patients under hospital directions. It could have a disastrous effect on relations between patient and hospital doctor. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, if the doctor and patient know that when a patient is better he will return to prison, what is the incentive for them to work together to improve the patient's health?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doctors may be reluctant to take patients from the courts in such circumstances. The proprosal would place an extremely unfair burden on psychiatric services and, for that reason, it would be better for the hospital direction to be dropped altogether. I look forward to the Minister's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the arguments advanced for amendments Nos. 85 and 90. They raise fundamental issues. We have a tried procedure whereby the courts look to the doctors for expert advice on whether to admit a person to hospital. The category of disorder that the person suffers from within the terms of sections 1 and 17 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 has no direct bearing on the criminal justice process or procedures; nor do I see why it should in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 90 borrows words from the 1984 Act to ring fence the new hospital direction apparently to restrict issues to those with a mental disorder—which, to use the working of the 1984 Act, is not a mental handicap. At present, the courts can imprison people with a mental handicap: they are not precluded from doing so. Sections 204 and 207 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 set out the considerations that the court had to take into account before imposing imprisonment for the first time on an under 21-year-old or an adult. In short, the court will not impose imprisonment unless it considers, in all the circumstances, that that is the appropriate method of dealing with the person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court has to weigh heavily the medical evidence regarding a person's mental condition and to take into account the degree of a person's mental handicap, whether there is any other mental disorder, the nature of the offence, the public interest and so on. In some cases, the court will decide on a sentence of imprisonment. I do not accept that if the courts impose custody on some offenders who have a mental handicap, they should be precluded from considering a hospital order. The courts can imprison someone if his mental handicap is of a nature or degree not sufficiently severe as to warrant admission to hospital under the 1984 Act. Where the handicap is more severe—of a nature or degree that would warrant hospitalization—we also allow the court to imprison. The court may listen to the medical evidence suggesting that hospital admission is an option, but may still decide that imprisonment is the appropriate disposal taking all considerations into account</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me develop the argument first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the proposal contained in amendment No. 90 that in future we should prevent courts from considering the custodial option in combination with a formal hospital order. I become more certain of that when I look at the definitions of mental handicap in the 1984 Act that qualify a person for admission to hospital, in particular the words
	<br><q><p>"abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct."</p></q>
We should leave it to the courts to consider all the factors and arrive at the most appropriate decision in each case. The flexibility is appropriate in principle and we shall make the new option available as widely as possible rather than continuing the inflexibility for just one group of offenders. That would be neither just nor sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton asked about a comparison with the English Crime (Sentences) Bill. In the first instance, hospital direction will be available only for psychopathically disordered offenders. The Bill provides for it to be extended by order to offenders suffering from other mental disorders. We are taking a different approach in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give us examples of the type of mental handicap and illness to which he is referring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave the example of a man who might kill a child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is murder. I want examples of mental illness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that, but someone who kills a child may be found guilty of culpable homicide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall wind up my remarks speedily, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a child is killed by someone who is mentally ill, it is appropriate for the court to protect the public as well as to give an order which, in mental health terms, is in the interest of that person, whether he is a patient or a prisoner. If that person recovers quickly, he may be returned to prison, depending on the outcome of the trial. The disposal will suit the mental health considerations of a patient while protecting the public at large.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
