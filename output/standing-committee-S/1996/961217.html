	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We fully discussed the purpose of the clause in the Scottish Grand Committee. It removes injustices and has the support of the Law Society of Scotland and various other bodies. I strongly commend it to committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed that we had no sittings motion to debate, however, as we are discussing clause 1, it would be helpful if the Minister could explain a little about what it means. I should like to know, in particular, whether we shall reinstate the perceived position in Scotland whereby it is not possible for people buying property to gazump, as has been the practice south of the border. We have always taken a pride in Scotland that, when a deal has been struck, the transaction must go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been bothered increasingly in recent years by constituency cases in which Scottish lawyers have started indulging in English habits and are mucking about with contractual clauses that enable the seller later to wriggle out of a contract. We could do without importing such a practice from south of the border and it would be useful if the Minister could say whether the clause will help to reinstate that principle of Scottish law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reassure the hon. Gentleman that there will be no gazumping in Scotland. We have different laws on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 replaces the existing rule that evidence from outside a written contract is not admissible to prove additional terms to that contract. The existing law has been described as uncertain, incoherent and unprincipled and it can lead to manifest injustice. In business, it often happens that contracting parties clearly intend that another term should have effect in addition to those set out in a written contract. Under the present law, if one of the contracting parties denies that there are any other terms, the court will not allow the other party to establish and prove terms that are not in the written document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Clause 1 will now enable evidence to be laid to prove additional terms to a contract, unless the written contract explicitly states that there are no such terms. It establishes a presumption that a document that appears to comprise all the express terms of a contract does actually do so. That presumption can be rebutted by extrinsic oral or documentary evidence of additional terms. The Scottish Law Commission concluded that it would not wish to undermine in any way the advantages of having contracts reduced to final written form or the advantages of being able to rely on such contractual documents as the sole source of the terms of the contract, when that is what the parties intended. The clause is a measure to ensure that the intention of the parties is honoured. It corrects manifest injustice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to use plain language in such matters. Will the Minister confirm that clause 1 deals only with extrinsic evidence of additional terms, not extrinsic evidence about existing terms? That is about as plain as I can put it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes is the short and the long answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister has explained the clause, but I am worried because he said that gazumping is not possible in Scotland. With respect, it does happen there. In recent years, cases have been drawn to ray attention in which Scots lawyers have indulges in the English practices of inserting conditions into contracts after bargains have been struck. Such action undermines an important principle of property transactions and the legal process north of the border. I hope that it is the intention of the Government and the Scottish Law Commission to reinstate the principle that, when a bargain has been made, both parties should be made to stand by it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the circumstances about which he is complaining have nothing to do with contract law. The clause does not affect that matter, but if he has a particular complaint, I strongly recommend him to write to me and the Under Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), who is the Minister responsible for housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> that the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for raising various constituency points, but I am concerned about people buying property and finding that conditions of which they were unaware at the time of the transaction are attached. I have in mind a constituent in

Musselburgh who bought a house, but later discovered that the seller had secured a loan and that bond was attached to the property rather than to the individual who had secured that loan. Therefore, the purchaser was liable and had to pay back the bank or the money lender, despite having been completely unaware of the loan at the time of purchase. Obviously, the claim was pursued against his lawyer and the Law Society of Scotland and some recompense was obtained from the lawyer for being negligent. How is it possible that such a loan could be secured against a property that belonged to someone else? That was grotesquely unfair and the legislation should offer protection against such abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From my days as a law student and law apprentice doing conveyancing transactions, I know that a solicitor has to make a search of all the previous relevant documents to ensure that any outstanding loans on the property are fully taken into account. The principle of caveat emptor also applies, which means that the buyer must beware and consider all the outstanding circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 replaces the existing rule—the Winston v. Patrick rule—that contract terms agreed between parties are superseded by the formal deed to implement the agreement, unless steps are taken to contract out of the rule. That is the case even when the formal deed does not implement all the agreed terms. The law has led to uncertainty and unnecessary litigation. Its effect is that certain contract terms, even if admitted by both parties or proved by admissible evidence to have been agreed, no longer have any legal effect after the execution of the deed intended to implement the contract. Therefore, the present rule often fails to implement the intention of the parties to an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new provision means that the intention of the parties to an agreement will be more likely to be fulfilled. Any unimplemented or unfulfilled term of the contract will remain outstanding and in force. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT OR SALE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that on Second Reading, the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham) referred to the Law Society of Scotland, and said:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It makes the point in respect of clause 3 that the whole point of reform is not to obtain damages as such, but to allow the purchaser to make the claim calculated on the reduction in the value of the subject while still retaining the subject and that the proposed reform should make it clear that the calculation is indeed based on the reduction in value. That does not seem to have found its way into the Bill."—[	<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 25 November 1996; c.42.]</p></blockquote>
We entirely approve of the change recommended by the Scottish Law Commission's report: "Three Bad Rules in Contract Law". It is a great step forward that someone will not have to leave his or her property to sue. However, before we give the clause final approval, I wonder whether the Minister can address his remarks to the point made by the Law Society of Scotland regarding the reduction in value in the calculation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Under the present law in cases other than those coming under the Sale of Goods Act 1979, a buyer who claims that there has been a breach of contract by a seller is not entitled to retain the property and claim for damages. The effect of that rule in relation to house sales is that a buyer is obliged to reconvey the house to the seller before being able to raise an action for a claim for a breach of contract. Unanimous support was expressed for the abolition of that rule, which is achieved in clause 3. A house buyer will now be able to retain the property when suing for damages for a breach of contract. That is the standard remedy for a breach of contract and the point of the reform is to allow such a claim to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Law Commission rejected the notion that a purchaser should be able to claim a monetary sum based on the value of the subjects that he or she has bought being worth less than what was paid for them. The commission's view was that it was better to leave the assessment of damages to the general law of damages rather than to introduce a special rule. Such a rule would not only add to the complexity of the clause, it would risk introducing anomalies in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), the Scottish Law Commission will be considering the general law on damages for breach of contract. That will be the best place to introduce any reform that might be required. The commission is considering that matter now. That work may, in due course, pave the way for another Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
