	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great pleasure to be in the constituency of the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North—East (Mr. Campbell), in the country in which my mother was born, raised and educated and in what my grandfather referred to without exception as the Kingdom of Fife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any Secretary of State for Defence is likely to be a frequent visitor to Scotland and I have enjoyed my excursions to Coulport and Faslane, the Army's headquarters the headquarters of 52 Lowland Brigade in Edinburgh, and to the Tornadoes and search and rescue helicopters at RAF Lossiemouth. Further afield, I have visited the Kings Own Scottish Borderers and the Highlanders on deployment in Northern Ireland, and also HMS Edinburgh in the Arabian Gulf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish units and heroes have played a distinguished role when they have fought for Britain. Throughout the cold war, Scotland was at the front line in defending the United Kingdom from attack from the air or by submarine and it was home to the nations's nuclear deterrent. I want to mention some of that history and to talk about Scotland's role in our national defence in modern times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsey improvised the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940 and commanded the D-day and Normandy landings in June 1944. Seaman George Mackenzie Sampson was the first Royal Naval reserve rating to be awarded the Victoria cross, for his actions on the beaches of Gallipoli. The Scots Guards, who provide a visible Scottish presence and protect the Queen when they are on public duties, fought bravely in the Falklands in 1982 and provided reinforcements for the Gulf in 1991. The Royal Scots is the oldest regiment in the British Army and it has fought in the service of the Crown of the United Kingdom since 1678. It was at Aboukir and Alexdrandia in 1801, Waterloo in 1815 and it fought bravely in Europe in the second world war and bravely again in the Gulf war. Piper Laidlaw of the Kings Own Scottish Borderers was awarded the Victoria cross at the battle of Loos during the first world war, when he played his regimental march, "Blue Bonnets O'er the Border", as his regiment stormed the German positions; he continued to do so until his wounds meant that he was unable to play any longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remember the valiant acts of the 602 (City of Glasgow) and 603 (City of Edinburgh) squadrons during the second world war—602 squadron was at one time commanded by the father of the Minister of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
(Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). During the war, those squadrons intercepted the first German bombing raid on British territory and shot down the first Luftwaffe aircraft to hit British soil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the first Spitfire aircraft. I am delighted to announce that a Spitfire with strong Scottish connections will be returned home for display to the public. The aircraft, which is known as LA198, was for a time the gate guardian at RAF Leuchars; before that, from 1947 to 1951, it served with 602 (City of Glasgow) squadron. The squadron no longer exists, but the members of 602 Museum Association have long wished for LA198 to be returned so that it could be displayed to the public in Glasgow. The Spitfire needs to be restored. Subject to the necessary parliamentary approvals, LA198 will, I hope, return from storage in England "back to base" in Glasgow before long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a former member of 603 squadron, I want to say how delighted everyone in Scotland will be that the Spitfire is returning to Glasgow and 602 squadron. We should bear in mind that 602 squadron was the first Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadron to be formed and had a magnificent war record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The records of the squadron and of my right hon. Friend are well known to the Committee and the House. I thank my right hon. Friend warmly for his tribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish units and personnel have served in the defence of the United Kingdom for many years. We are a United Kingdom—the Union gives us strength and weight and the ability to wield real influence and do good around the world. That influence is a force for reason in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Union also gives us security against any external threat to these islands; security as a highly effective member of NATO; and security for the wider global interests of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland is vital to the United Kingdom's integrated defence. Our armed forces and the fabric of our defence structure are totally integrated across the United Kingdom. Each element is an inseparable part of the greater whole. The collapse of the Soviet Union was a triumph for liberal-democratic values, but the parallel collapse of its integrated defence structure offers a stark lesson for those who, against all logic, advocate separatism here, with all that that entails—less security; waste and duplication; uncertainty and confusion; and disastrous consequences for the defence industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must preserve Scotland's vital place in the United Kingdom's integrated defence. The first element of that is the nuclear deterrent. Our operationally independent deterrent provides the ultimate guarantee of the United Kingdom's national security and makes a vital contribution to NATO's war prevention strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Faslane is the Royal Navy's main submarine operating base and home to our force of modern Vanguard submarines—there are two at present and the third, HMS Vigilant, is due to arrive for sea trials soon. The Trident missile defence system will provide the United Kingdom's strategic deterrent and, from 1998, its sub-strategic capability. That system is ably supported by the armaments depot at Coulport, where dedicated service men and women work hard to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
maintain the deterrent. In recent years, both bases have benefited from enormous investment in the latest specialised infrastructure, systems and engineering support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The royal dockyard at Rosyth is another important national asset. Negotiations with Babcock have been concluded and we intend to sign the sale contract shortly, subject only to acceptable final contract terms and conditions. That agreement represents good value for taxpayers and will generate savings of £100 million over 10 years. It will give Babcock and its employees the prospect of a secure, long-term future for the dockyard. To assist in that, the Government have allocated a significant programme of ship refit work to the yard that will last well into the next decade. The forthcoming refits of, among others, the carriers HMS Invincible and HMS Ark Royal and the nuclear-powered submarines HMS Sceptre and HMS Spartan will take place at Rosyth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to make it clear that negotiations with Rosyth 2000 will shortly reach a conclusion and the consortium is preparing to take over the base. I want to pay tribute to Mr. Negus, the industrial convenor of the trade unions of Rosyth, whom I met this morning, and his colleagues, who played a significant part in the negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is right to highlight the need to ensure stability at Rosyth. Certain work has been allocated, but not guaranteed. Do the present contractual negotiations encompass the guaranteeing in contractual terms of the work that is necessary to ensure the long-term future of the dockyards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have allocated the work and intend that it be undertaken at Rosyth. However, the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East, who is a student of such matters, will understand that that depends on a reasonable price being quoted at the time. The Government cannot sign a blank cheque. Our intentions to allocate the work are perfectly clear, as the precision with which I have been willing to name specific vessels to be refitted at Rosyth indicates. It is my expectation that that will be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it our experience so far that Babcock always quotes an acceptable price? Is not Babcock's record on both Ministry of Defence and other work a lesson to other companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been pleased to work with Babcock over the years. Like other firms in the country, Babcock has benefited from the competitive environment. We want the compa1ny to remain competitive in the future, because that is what is required in the world market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has spoken of the competitive environment, reasonable prices and blank cheques, but will he cast his mind back to the circumstances surrounding the decision to deprive Rosyth of the Trident refitting contract? The contract went to Devonport
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
instead, probably for political reasons. How much of a blank cheque have the Government given to Devonport, and how much will it cost to bring those docks up to the standard required by the nuclear safety authorities? How much more will such work cost at Devonport than at Rosyth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made a full statement to the House on that matter—in May, if my memory serves me correctly—and have nothing to add to that. I have no reason to doubt that the original decision was well made and firmly based. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) seems to wish to ignore today's announcement of what is extremely good news for Rosyth. The people whom I met on the streets outside this Committee today confirmed that they consider that the successful conclusion of the negotiations—with the clear decisions about the dockyards and the future of the naval base, and the allocation of a work programme—represents a massive opportunity. They will not take kindly to the hon. Gentlemen's carping, nor to his lessons in history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's constituency is involved in what we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for making the announcements that have brought some good news to the dockyard work force. Those workers have remained loyal and committed, even though they have been kept dangling on the edge for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what the Secretary of State has said, but he has not given a guaranteed work load. He maintains that the work is subject to pricing, and he has not mentioned any guarantees on workers' pension entitlements or terms and conditions. He has not set a precise date by which the Rosyth 2000 negotiations will be concluded, nor has he said anything about a secure future for the naval support establishment and the supplies depots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State can be more detailed and precise, and that he can give the guarantees that the work force needs so that people can have a secure future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Lady on those questions, although I am naturally keen not to detain the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees' pensions are protected by the trustees of the pension fund. At present, we are considering how to deal with the surplus that has arisen in the pension fund. I think that the surplus will be adjusted by some combination of an improvement in benefits—which will be a matter for negotiation—and reductions in what the Ministry of Defence has to pay in future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to terms and conditions, Babcock has made it clear that much time has been spent in negotiating the redundancy package. That package was the subject of a ballot by members, who understand it well. The Babcock management has made it clear that changes in terms and conditions are a matter for negotiation between it and the industrial side. Finally, I hope very much that it will be only a matter of weeks before we can proceed with the naval base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving north to the Moray Firth, RAF Kinloss is home to the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft fleet—three front-line squadrons and an operational conversion unit.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Those aircraft form an integral part of operations in and around Europe and participated in the United Nations sanctions against the former Republic of Yugoslavia. They also have a vital anti-submarine role, which is becoming ever more important with the increased use of submarines by navies worldwide. The Government have announced their replacement by Nimrod 2000, at a cost of £2 billion, bringing jobs to Prestwick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
RAF Leuchars is home to two squadrons of our primary air defence fighter—the Tornado F3, to 3 Flight Army Air Corps, to the Aberdeen, Dundee and St. Andrew's university air squadron and to the East Lothian university air squadron. I shall be visiting them this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned Prestwick which, as he knows, is the home of the second air traffic centre for the United Kingdom. The Government have decided to press ahead with the privatisation of air traffic control if they win the next general election. What consultation has there been with the Ministry of Defence about the effect of privatisation on military aircraft and air traffic control? What assurances have been received about that? I hope that some assurances have been given. My information is that the privatisation of air traffic control will place a cloud over the future of military air traffic control. Would not that be totally irresponsible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is not as the hon. Gentleman describes it. The Ministry of Defence has been fully consulted. We shall find a way forward—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to say how. I am not the Minister with departmental responsibility, so it is not for me to make the statement, but I am happy that through privatisation we shall be able to improve the service, secure investment for the future and provide safety. I remind the hon. Gentleman that even the Labour party is no longer meant to believe that privatisation is a dirty word—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh yes we do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There you are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State completely misunderstands the situation. There is a difference between privatising and attracting private finance. The Labour party has made it clear that it will stop all privatisation—including that of air traffic control—as soon as it wins the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady wrote to me about the first matter. As to the second, we have made no final decisions about the disposition of squadrons many years in the future. There is nothing unusual about that, but the replacement maritime aircraft have performed very satisfactorily in Bruggen. Scotland's three United Kingdom air defence ground environment stations are an essential part of our air defence system.

Ten regiments of the British Army are recruited in Scotland. Scottish regiments make a major contribution wherever the British Army serves. The Royal Highland Fusiliers recently took part in a brigade-level exercise in Poland—the first ever on that scale in a former Warsaw pact country. A company from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders has just returned from a tour in the Falkland islands. The Royal Scots is providing the infantry element of the new joint rapid deployment force's lead aviation battle group. The Black Watch, which I had the privilege of meeting while it was at Ballater guarding the Queen, will be the last battalion in Hong Kong when Britain leaves the colony.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish regiments have made a vital contribution in Bosnia. In UNPROFOR—the UN protection force in Bosnia-Herzegovina—the Royal Highland Fusiliers served with distinction in central Bosnia, conducting regular Warrior patrols during the winter of 1994 to help to sustain the fragile Muslim-ceasefire. The Highland gunners—I9 Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, which is equipped with 105 mm light guns—provided essential supporting fire during the allied air campaign in August 1995 from their positions on Mount Igman, overlooking Sarajevo. Next month, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards will deploy to Bosnia to carry on that excellent tradition of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman notice of my question: is the Scots Dragoon Guards on type 38 establishment? It has only 330 members and has never been so under-stablished. There are real problems—it has returned from Suffield—in implementing leave entitlement. Has the right hon. Gentleman anything to add?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was most courteous in giving me notice last night of his question. My figures show that a type 38 armoured regiment, which the RSDG is, should have an establishment of 470, including a regimental headquarters, a headquarters squadron and four armoured squadrons. The current strength of the RSDG is 465, just five short of that number. The regiment will be one of the first to take the Challenger 2, and I am sure that it is looking forward to that. As for leave, I am told that some people will get only two weeks while the majority of those deploying to Bosnia will get three. I have no knowledge of anyone not enjoying leave, which is what the hon. Gentleman was concerned about. If he wants to pursue the matter I shall, of course, be delighted to assist him.

NATO's operation in Bosnia to support the Dayton peace agreement has been a great success. I can announce to the Committee that, subject to parliamentary approval, the Government have agreed that £220 million will be

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman.

The Scottish military tradition is reflected in the depth and strength of relationships between the Army and the people of Scotland. The Army is committed to Scotland and to investment here. We shall demonstrate that with the launch of the Army personnel centre in Glasgow on 2 December. That organisation will be responsible for the career management and administration of the life of every serving member of the Army and the Territorial Army, and will look after more than 500,000 service men and women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Civilians working for the Ministry of Defence are also strongly represented in Scotland, with 10,000 employees. The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency has six major sites in Scotland. Most of the United Kingdom's current generation of laser-guided weapons and bombs were developed at the trials range at West Freugh in Kirkudbrightshire. It is also home to a state-of-the-art satellite ground station, the first in the world to be awarded a blue ribbon by RADARSAT International of Canada for its work on processing images and data for use in civil projects. We support nearly 100 defence related projects in Scottish universities, worth several hundred million pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The defence industry is also well represented in Scotland. The Government are committed to armed forces that are resourced and equipped to undertake the tasks that we ask of them. The Government have increased efficiency and eliminated waste, which has allowed us to make more investment in the latest and most cost-effective equipment. It enables our industry to compete effectively, both in the United Kingdom and overseas and ensures its involvement at the frontiers of technology.

Yarrow shipbuilders continues the proud tradition of naval shipbuilding on the Clyde. It is currently completing two frigates for the Malaysian navy and has won an order to supply three corvettes to Brunei. These orders were won against world-class competition. The yard also won the fiercely contested order for the final batch of three Type-23 frigates for the Royal Navy. These orders are worth £400 million.

If it was in relation to Eurofighter, the problem with decision-making lies not in the United Kingdom but with our German colleagues. None the less, I hope that we shall hear from the Germans in the early part of next year that they will proceed with the project and are fully committed to it, because it is excellent news for the export potential of Britain and of Scotland within that.

Pilkington Optronics in Glasgow makes a wide range of electro—optical equipment, including the periscope for the Trident submarine and the gunsights for the Challenger.

Scotland is home to the six regiments of the Scottish division, to RAF squadrons essential to our national defence, to the nuclear deterrent, to refit facilities for the Royal Navy, to fine defence contractors and to research institutions which are developing our future defence technologies. That demonstrates the depth and breadth of Scotland's contribution to the defence of our united realm and, equally, Scotland's stake in defence. These hard facts are worth repeating whenever separatism raises it head. In defence, separatism is not even a zero—sum game.

We welcome the Secretary of State to Scotland. We welcome him because of the great office that he holds and because, despite whatever differences we may have, we are a naturally courteous and hospitable nation. We also welcome him because we are building up our tourist industry and any visits, no matter how infrequent and short, are welcome.

I was surprised when the right hon. Gentleman gave his family history and connections to hear of his deep roots in Scotland. I was reminded of when Mohammed Ali stopped off in Ireland on his way to a world title fight claiming Irish ancestry. We take it to heart that the right hon. Gentleman has deep roots in Scotland. We also welcome the announcements which, by a remarkable coincidence, he brought with him such as the return of LA198 to 602 squadron and the start of recruitment at the Army personnel centre. I shall return to the announcement on Rosyth.

Is it not amazing how often a decision that has been postponed, cancelled, delayed and changed by the dithering incompetence of the Government seems miraculously resurrected—in all its finality—just in time to bolster a ministerial visit to Scotland? Decisions such as those that we have welcomed today should have been taken long ago on their merits. Their timing should not have been contrived as a back-drop to another dismal attempt to revive the reputation of a dismal Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several aspects of the Secretary of State's visit today that we do not welcome. He is among us now not only as Secretary of State for Defence but—according to the book cover—as the standard bearer for "The Future of the Tory Right". He stands here as probably the best-known defender of the faith of Thatcherism—a creed that has been and always will be held in contempt by the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not by Mr. Blair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A creed that is held in contempt by every member of the Labour party from top to bottom—irrespective of the personal characteristics of the person who perpetrated the creed. The Secretary of State arrives also as the Tory heir apparent; the young pretender to the Tory throne has arrived in Scotland, ably encouraged and abetted by his own wee Flora MacDonald, the Secretary of State for Scotland—[	<i>Laughter</i>.] It is no good raising that standard here; there is no fertile ground for it. It signals a brand of politics that has no roots in Scottish soil; it represents callousness and social cruelty, which have been consistently rejected by the Scottish people over the past 17 years. It will be just as decisively rejected again as soon as the Government have the guts to call a general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our differences with the Secretary of State relate not only to social and economic policy. As he said earlier, Scotland has a great martial tradition. For centuries this small nation has provided the backbone of the British Army. We have always provided more than our fair share of the country's service men and women. Even now, although Scotland comprises only 9 per cent. of the population, it provides 14 per cent. of the British Army.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our first question to the Secretary of State for Defence on his state visit to Scotland is to ask why he is presiding over a record low in recruitment to Scottish regiments. Why is it that every Scottish regiment—bar one—is short of soldiers? He should be ashamed of the fact that for the first time in decades—indeed centuries—the proud names that he mentioned earlier cannot attract sufficient numbers of young men and women to their banners. Why? Because of the incompetence of the Tory Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Defence failed to mention that the Government have spent £500 million in making soldiers redundant and that they are now spending £150 million to bring soldiers back in. He ordered the wholesale closure of recruiting offices and then had to order them to be reopened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell (Monklands, East)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stony face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as my hon. Friend says, there are some stony faces opposite us. These are the people who closed down The Gordon' s because, they told us, we had too
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
many soldiers in the infantry. Now they are telling us that we have too few. This is the Administration who forced 42,000 soldiers a year out of the armed forces of this country and who no tell us that we do not have enough. It beggars belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, the Government announced a shortfall in the Army of just under 3,000 so they pledged to redouble their efforts. They did so, and what was the result? They redoubled the shortfall which is over 5,350 as of September this year. I ask the Secretary of State to consider what it has come to when the Royal Scots—the great regiment to which he referred earlier, the First of Foot, the oldest regiment in the British Army, often known as Pontius Pilot's Bodyguard—is reduced to importing a company of Gurkha riflemen in order to maintain its strength? That is a scandal of the highest order. Who is to blame? I shall give way to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not mean to insult the Gurkhas, who have given magnificent service to the Crown over many years. Does he not accept that part of the problem with recruitment is that the Labour party has pledged to cut defence year after year? The Labour party now tries to give the impression that defence is an activity in decline, but we have sought to recruit young men and women into the armed forces because they offer one of the finest careers that any young person could undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the faces around the Room now of the worriers who, over the years, sought to cut the defences of our country and who pledged to abolish our nuclear deterrent. I see those guilty faces in front of me now and the hon. Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid) must accept his share of responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has asked for it and he is going to get it. First, I had no intention of diminishing the role of the Gurkhas. Indeed, it is a disgrace that, after serving this country for decades, they have to be brought back here from Hong Kong, but the Secretary of State will not even allow them to bring their wives and families with them. The scandal is not that the Gurkhas should be brought over here, but that the Royal Scots should be so reduced in strength under the Government that they need to import people from anywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I shall deal with defence expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I have finished with the Secretary of State for Defence, I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has reduced the numbers in the British armed forces by 32 per cent. He has cut the defence budget by 32 per cent. In 1992, he warned the country that Labour would cut defence by 27 per cent.; yet in power, he has cut defence by 5 per cent. more than the amount demanded by the Labour party conference. We will take no lectures on cuts from the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should give the Committee some facts and I caution him to be careful in what he says—[HoN. MEMBERS: "Oh".] We are old friends. Will he tell the Committee about the condition of Scottish and other Army regiments in March 1979? What were the manning levels then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deny in front of the cameras that the hon. Gentleman and I are in any way good friends as his suggestion otherwise might destroy my reputation. However, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that in March 1979 the British Army was undermanned and soldiers' wages were far too low. Our commitment to NATO was also far too low. That is precisely why the then Labour Prime Minister, James Callaghan, pushed through the House of Commons an agreement to carry out a revision of those wages. That resulted in massive increases in the wages of soldiers, sailors and airmen. There was also a pledge to NATO in 1978 to increase defence expenditure by 3 per cent. The increases that contribution over five years to the reputation of the Secretary of State's idol as "the Iron Lady" were in fact pressed through the House by her Labour predecessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for facts, so I shall provide him with some. In March this year the Kings Own Scottish Borderers were more than 7 per cent. under strength; the Royal Highland Fusiliers were almost 14 per cent. under strength; and the Argyll and Southern Highlanders were a massive 17 per cent. under strength. Those figures relate not to 1979; but to March 1996. The man sitting on the Treasury Bench is to blame for that shortfall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned the Black Watch. Out of a battalion of 550, the Black Watch is short of 71 privates, 14 lance corporals and four officers—89 short out of 550. That is the regiment of whose proud history the Secretary of State spoke today; the regiment that he has reduced by 15 per cent. beneath its establishment figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin O'Neil 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend accept that perhaps it is not wholly the Secretary of State's fault? When the Army recruiting service came to Alloa, it did so almost under cover of dark. It advertised in the newspapers and through the local employment office saying that jobs would be available, but it did not say who was offering the jobs. People turned up, looking for employment, and found that they had the chance of being recruited into the armed forces. So embarrassed are the Government of their record of support for the armed forces, they are not prepared even to say that they are running a recruitment campaign. As it was, a number of my constituents who have been unemployed for too long took the opportunity and are now in the Argylls. However, it would surely have been better if they had been recruited in the proper manner and with due respect to the regiment, which is short of men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes that point better than I could have done. It illustrates the Government's incompetence on recruitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Scotland were a nation with no history of service, if it were a country of full employment and if no one here needed or wanted a job, such under recruitment might be understandable. But so unbelievable has been the scale of incompetence, that in a country of martial tradition such as Scotland, which is blighted by Tory-created unemployment and therefore has more potential recruits than are needed, the Government end up with every Scottish regiment being short of soldiers and spend £500 million in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The issue does not affect only the Army. Earlier this year there was the extraordinary incident of an RAF station commander putting in writing what he felt were the operational and morale effects of under-staffing in the RAF.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons for that under-manning is the piecemeal and incompetent fashion in which the Government have chopped and changed—mainly chopped—the intended configuration of the armed forces. I will consider the possibility that that is nothing to do with the Secretary of State, but sometimes as I read the newspapers, it occurs to me that he might have something to do with that shortfall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I read in the Daily Express at the beginning of this month an article headlined:
	<br><blockquote><p>"SAS fights losing battle. Dozens quit elite force".</p></blockquote>
It seems that that started about the time that the Secretary of State for Defence publicly declared in Blackpool that he was a leading supporter—indeed, almost an honorary member—of the SAS. The immediate effects were dozens of resignations from the SAS and a plummeting number of applications to join, so the Secretary of State cannot completely be exonerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Secretary of State, because he is a man who believes in the market, that there is another reason for those resignations—wages. We are now running a volunteer Army. We have to attract people to it. Let us consider the wages of those in the armed services since the Government came to power. Whatever the Government may say, there is no difference between Tories in civil society and Tories in the military. Between 1979 and last year, the remuneration of generals, admirals and air-vice-masrshals, had increased by 15 per cent. in real terms. The remuneration of privates, rating and ordinary airmen had decreased by 15 per cent. in real terms. It is the same old Tory story—more brass for the top brass and peanuts for the poor infantry. The Tories deal exactly with the armed forces as they do with civil society. Their handling of the defence industries, which the Secretary of State mentioned, has been no better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the remuneration of the armed forces is settled by an independent pay review body. Is the hon. Gentleman deciding that under a Labour Government salaries would be settled in some other way? Is he pledging to make available more money for pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman responds, I say to members of the public that portable telephones must be switched off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, of course I accept that armed forces pay is set by an independent body. We all have free will, but we do not always operate it in circumstances of our choosing. I noticed that the Secretary of State was featured in 	<i>The Times</i> last week with a large photograph, saying that we must give our ordinary soldiers some more money. I agree. That does not take away the independence of the review body, but sets the context. Any incoming Government, and it is likely to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
a Labour Government, will have to pay attention to that. If one is operating in a market, one has to pay the right price to attract young men and women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of Rosyth, which was much failed today—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Flora MacDonald will stop interrupting from a sedentary position, I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was asked specifically whether a Labour Government would make a pledge on the subject on which he was criticising the Government. Will he answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am giving the answer. If the right hon. Gentleman does not understand market mechanisms after bragging about them for 17 years, I cannot help him. If there is a shortage of soldiers, sailors and airmen and one is competing on the market, it is obvious that one has to increase the attractions to bring people into the armed forces. Salaries are one of the attractions for anybody joining anything. I cannot explain that to the right hon. Gentleman in simpler terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the non—announcement on Rosyth. I welcome today's news as far as it goes, but it is disappointing. We should read the footnotes carefully. After four years, the Secretary of State is now saying that the Government hope shortly to conclude the sale, subject to continuing negotiations. I have a number of comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Secretary of State cannot turn up here playing the guise of the saviour of Rosyth. He and his hon. Friends started that unholy mess. If he thinks that stony faces reflected only boredom with his speech or were a reflection of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), let me make our position plain by reiterating that we were and are opposed to the privatisation of Rosyth and Devonport and, incidentally, to that of air traffic control at Prestwick. Even the old pretender, the Deputy Prime Minister, when he came here in the mid-1980s, made it plain that the dockyards were strategic assets which should be retained by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the principle of sale, the dithering and delay by the Government over Rosyth since the sale was first announced have been enormously damaging to the morale of the work force and to the development of the business. If today's announcement is to mean anything, the Secretary of State should have been prepared to give a simple pledge, which he has so far avoided under questioning from three hon. Members. He should give us that pledge today—reaffirm the two-dockyard solution and declare that Rosyth's allocated programme of work is safe. He should give us the assurance that the conditions and security of the work force—in particular its surplus and pension fund—will be safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State needs to go further. After the sale, he and the Government cannot wash their hands of responsibility for Rosyth and Devonport dockyards. They remain strategic assets and the MOD remains their biggest single customer. The Government have a responsibility to work with both yards, the local authorities and the local
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
communities to develop the yards. Naval work will decline and it is therefore essential that there is full Government support to push forward, for example, with the Rosyth 2000 project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Rosyth as elsewhere, the Government's handling of changes in the defence industry have not inspired confidence. Over the past 10 years, we have lost some 300,000 jobs throughout the United Kingdom, perhaps 30,000 of them in Scotland. Today I ask again, why are the Government not prepared to assist firms affected by that transition? Why will they not establish a defence diversification agency? The need for such assistance became so obvious a few years ago that the then Secretary of State for Scotland, now the President of the Board of Trade, was forced to promise the establishment of a unit within the Scottish Office. So far as I have been able to discover, that defence diversification unit consisted of one civil servant, whom I understand was seconded, and one desk, which was leased. The civil servant has now disappeared—the first person ever to go missing in inaction—and the desk has been repossessed. When will the Government make an attempt to assist firms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee whether a Labour Government would give work to Rosyth regardless of price or whether there would indeed be an element of competitive pricing in any work that was allocated to Rosyth by a Labour Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have never said that we would give work to anyone regardless of price. The reality is that the Secretary of State for Defence has for four years had an opportunity to give some form of guarantee, and yet on a visit to Scotland four years later, he is still unable or unwilling to give such a guarantee. That is what I am criticising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he would not give work regardless of price. That is precisely my position. He can huff and puff all he likes, but he cannot in reality, make any distinction between my position and his. Let us give up all that nonsense. We have an allocated programme that will be allocated to Rosyth provided that Rosyth can, as I anticipate, give us satisfactory prices. That is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, you are the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. That is the point. The Secretary of State for Defence has had four years of information, assistance and civil servants for confidential and commercial operations—four years to negotiate an agreement with which he is satisfied and on which he can make a pledge—and yet he turns up today still dithering and delaying. It is an absolute disgrace to the people who work in Rosyth, but it is nothing less than we have come to expect from the right hon. Gentleman. He has behaved in exactly the same way over orders for Yarrow, where hundreds of workers have been laid off because of consistent delays in the ordering pattern of the Ministry of Defence. Bishopton, along with the other royal ordnance factories, has suffered months and years of insecurity for the same reason.

Defence workers in Scotland have always been prepared to support the Government in a crisis. The country owes them the same support during their crisis of transition, but they are not getting it from the Government. That lack of assistance is similar to the way in which veterans have been treated. Pregnant servicewomen have been handed £50 million plus. The veterans who suffer from Gulf war syndrome have been ignored by the Government for four years and yet they were prepared to risk their lives for this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that would be understandable if the Government did not waste money elsewhere. When, however, that same Government's 25 top contracts were investigated by the National Audit office, 23 of them had been over cost or over time, including £800 million more than anticipated being spent at Faslane. The Government's record does not lend them any credence on the issue of defence in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have very little time in which to deal with the defence policy of a minority Opposition party such as the Scottish National party, but I suppose that that is commensurate with its importance. I shall say merely that we have at present more than 10,000 ground troops deployed in Bosnia, with two squadrons of Challenger tanks, Saracens and Scimitars and accompanying artillery and engineers. That force is larger than the whole army that the Scottish National party intends to have under its commander and chief, the bonnie prince of Banff and Buchan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No new generation of frigates is planned by the SNP, so Yarrow would be in trouble. No European fighter is planned, so Ferranti would be in deep trouble. No challenger tanks or Trafalgar Class submarine are planned, which would affect the workers down the road at Pilkington Optronics. No Trident is planned, so let us close down Rosyth or Faslane. No tank training ground is planned for our 10 tanks so, believe it or not, according to the SNP document we are going to ask whether we can use England's tank training ground. We can imagine it—within months of telling England to get stuffed, we would be asking to borrow its roads to train our tanks on. I doubt whether any member of the Scottish National party could tell the difference between an AS90 and SA80. It might be worth asking them. [	<i>Laughter</i>.] I will not ask the Secretary of State. It looks as though the ignorance of SNP Members is almost as great as that of the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) put it succinctly. He knows that the AS90 is a 155 mm large, self-transportable mortar with a four-tonne engine, while the SA80 is the normal gun by the British armed forces. The way to tell the difference between them is to drop them on your foot—it is then obvious which is the mortar and which is the gun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP has produced a blueprint for a glorified Celtic constabulary which bears no relationship to the traditions and capabilities of Scottish fighting forces. For a national that was reared for decades on the tunes of glory, "We're on the march with Alex's army" does not have the same
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
ring about it. More importantly, a separate Scotland, like any small nation of commensurate size—Norway, Denmark and Holland were mentioned—would be able to afford decently sized armed services only by bringing back conscription. I do not hear the SNP saying that to young voters. Why does it not come clean? It must be honest about the price of independence. Its message is, "Vote SNP and pack up your auld tartan kitbag; Alex's army awaits you."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This diatribe is totally misleading—I do not know which defence document the hon. Gentleman has read. We have been explicit—we do not intend to bring in conscription. We are instead considering the possibility of recruitment. The hon. Gentleman has already noted that Scottish forces are under strength at the moment and that there is under-recruitment. We have made our position abundantly clear. The hon. Gentleman must not continue in that vein; it is totally misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have looked closely at the SNP document and have noted those countries with which Scotland is compared. If the SNP wants to defend the land mass of Scotland on the budget and figures that it has given, it will have to bring in conscription. It claims that Scotland is 10 per cent. of the United Kingdom, but it cannot just divide the number of soldiers in the United Kingdom by 10. Scotland is 30 per cent. of the United Kingdom by land mass. There is no alternative to conscription with its figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party wants none of that. The current British armed forces are respected the world over. As we speak, Scottish men and women serve throughout the world in those British armed forces. They serve in the Navy as it stands sentinel in the Adriatic off the Balkans, as it enforces sanctions in the Armilla patrol in the Gulf and as it deters drug traffic in the Caribbean. They fly in the skies over Bosnia and Iraq, the eyes and the claws of the United Nations. They are prepared for tasks to come, such as the Black Watch in Kenya. They face up to the harsh, murderous realities of the current modern world, as did the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Kings Own Scottish Borderers in Bosnia. Like the Highlanders who are currently on the streets of Northern Ireland, they doggedly persist with the problems that are passed to them by history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are Scots in all those places and in numerous other parts of the world doing our work, under our orders, serving our country. Wherever they are, whatever task they undertake, however hard it may be, whatever the difficulties, the privations or the risks, they will persist and endure with the same professionalism, skill, determination and, above all, the same spirit which for generations has made the Jocks the backbone of the British armed forces. They deserve our gratitude and respect, not only in words but in deeds. They deserve, above all, a political leadership that will ensure that they get it. Within six months, they shall have such a leadership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be churlish not to welcome the Secretary of State for Defence to Fife, and to north-east Fife in particular.

We should also be particularly appreciative of his presence, and that of his right hon. Friend, because I know that this afternoon at half past three they would much prefer to be sitting beside the Chancellor of the Exchequer, giving him the same fervent and unconditional support that they have given him in recent weeks and months on the Government's policy on Europe. They have made a great sacrifice to be with us today, and we should recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also relieved that the Secretary of State has found his way to Cupar. This is not the first time he has visited my constituency, although on the last occasion he did so inadvertently. He thought that the village of Freuchie was in Kirkcaldy and, as a result, intimated his attendance to the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), but not to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State sought to persuade the Committee that the Government have a proud record which demonstrates efficient management and stewardship of the defences of the United Kingdom. That is far from the truth. The Government's management of our defence has been inadequate and characterised by inefficiency and waste. The hon. Member for Motherwell, North, in what almost became a viva for the shadow Minister responsible for arms procurement policy, mentioned the SA80. It is not a gun, but a rifle—the personal weapon of every British soldier. This Government sent British soldiers to the Gulf war with a rifle that had never been properly tested in the desert and, as a result, would not function. They sent them to the Gulf war with a rifle whose bayonet snapped off in ordinary use and with a cleaning kit that was not effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Gulf war, this country put one armoured division into the United Nations' effort. To do that, it had to cannibalise three armoured divisions in Germany, as a result of which there was no usable tank left on mainland Europe available to the United Kingdom. One day last December, of the 30 Tornado aircraft based at RAF Bruggen only six were capable of flying because of the lack of spare parts and engines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the independent nuclear deterrent and he mentioned Faslane. He did not explain to the Committee why there was an overspend of £800 million, identified by the National Audit Office, on the ship—lift facility at Faslane.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Tornados in the Gulf, the hon. Gentleman should be well aware—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
member of the Committee or, indeed, any other Member of the House. I prefer the views of his right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries, but I should not want to introduce any unnecessary rivalry to the Back Benches of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should be aware that the serviceability of Tornado aircraft in the Gulf was extremely good. It was good because British Aerospace was so determined to get the contract for the European fighter aircraft that it deployed large numbers of civilians to the Gulf to make sure that the aircraft were available. That is not always easily done, and could be done only in the context of the Gulf war because of the facilities that were available in Saudi Arabia and because the servicing of the aircraft could be carried out a long way from the seat of conflict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of servicing on the Harriers was extremely good—there is no dispute about that. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) wishes to make a cause of the Government's attitude towards aircraft, he should remember that the privatisation of certain servicing elements of RAF Tornados has resulted in the shambles that was Airwork and the fact that 16 aircraft, privately serviced, were reckoned, by those who know about these matters, to be in such a dangerous condition that had they been flown in anything approaching combat, the pilots would almost certainly have perished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State talked about the British defence industry. He is right to do so; he is right to talk about the importance for British Aerospace of the European fighter aircraft. I cannot help remembering, however, that he was the Secretary of State who, but a few months ago, considered leasing F16 aircraft from the United States instead of updating the Tornado aircraft, a proposal which was generally reckoned to be likely to undermine the very Eurofighter programme about which he spoke. Indeed, some would say that it would have undermined the programme to such an extent that it would have taken the heart out of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State tells us that he is going to RAF Leuchars. I am glad to hear that. He will find the same standards of professionalism and courage as were demonstrated by the young men who flew Spitfires in the war. Everyone will welcome the announcement that he has made about that. However, he will also find very fragile morale. While he is there, he might just ask about search-and-rescue facilities. Throughout the 1992 general election campaign in this constituency, local Conservatives accused me and others of scaremongering when we said that we thought the search-and-rescue helicopters at RAF Leuchars were at risk. We were told that there was no such possibility—indeed, the right hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King) was dispatched north to give assurances about the future of search-and-rescue at Leuchars. Within a few months, the Government announced the withdrawal of search and rescue helicopters from Leuchars, and what came to be called the friendly yellow helicopter is no longer available in a part of the world where the sea is of great importance and the fishing industry of great economic significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In July, the Secretary of State announced the replacement of the maritime patrol aircraft, a matter of considerable importance to the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). Everyone knows that that particular
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
announcement, and the two announcements on armaments with which it was parallel, depended on the contract to sell off the married quarters of all three services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that, in defence matters, the Government consider the value of anything to be the price that it will command if it is sold. It is sad that many people in the services, and those who have an interest in them, believe that the Government now pay insufficient attention to the values and traditions of all three services, which can be neither bought nor sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the purpose of the debate is to allow some consideration of Scottish National party defence policy. That is implied in the title of the debate. This will be a first, Mr. Stewart: it will be the first time publicly that any Member of Parliament of the Scottish National party has discussed SNP defence policy since its announcement some 12 or 18 months ago. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where are they?"] Perhaps the pressure of your scrutiny of these proposals, Mr. Stewart, has been such that they have felt it necessary to withdraw, regroup and—perhaps—send for reinforcements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SNP defence policy is naive in the extreme. As the hon. Member for Motherwell, North pointed out a moment ago, it is based on a purely arithmetical calculation and a series of invalid assumptions. If it were implemented, it would reduce the Scottish armed forces to a gendarmerie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One element of the policy that exposes its flaws and delusions is the determination of the Scottish National party to withdraw from NATO, the single most successful defensive alliance in history. During the past two or three weeks I have met the Presidents of Poland and of Latvia, both of whose countries want to join NATO. But the SNP wants to leave NATO. It wants to be a great player on the international stage, taking its proud place between Saudi Arabia and Senegal—to quote the phrase used by Mrs. Ewing, a Member of the European Parliament, which will resonate down the ages. That great player on the international stage want to withdraw from the one alliance that every country in Europe wants to join. If any illustration of its falsity of thinking was needed, that is it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Babcock has done extremely well as a contractor at Rosyth, which was mentioned earlier; it would be idle to pretend otherwise. However, it will continue to do well only if the allocated work is guaranteed. We should remember the history of such matters. A previous Conservative Administration promised that the Trident submarine refitting work would go to Rosyth, but then breached that promise. To placate opinion in Scotland, especially in the Dunfermline constituency, the then Secretary of State for Defence announced that work would be allocated to Rosyth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No contractor should be given a blank cheque. The system of NAPNOC—no approved price, no contract—is well known and established and I subscribe to that system, but not to giving blank cheques. The blankest of cheques has been given to Devonport, in respect of which the position is still uncertain. Its capacity to deal with nuclear matters has still not been finally determined and apparently the Government are going to assume financial responsibility. By comparison, many people believe that Rosyth has been dealt with on a much less favourable basis than Devonport. The financial basis on which the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
decision was made to allocate submarine refitting to Devonport was, to say the least, questionable, and it is even more questionable now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Babcock needs stability, the allocated refits promised by the previous Secretary of State and one further thing—if it is to concentrate on surface work, there must be no further reduction in the surface fleet, which now comprises some 35 frigates and destroyers. Any further reduction would undoubtedly affect Babcock's viability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have come here to discuss Scotland's defence, but in defence matters Scotland is no different from the rest of the United Kingdom—it needs a change of Government and it needs resources to be matched to commitments. We need an end to empty rhetoric and to the Government's comfortable assumptions. Unless and until we have a defence policy in which commitments and resources are in balance, the problems of overstretch and difficulties that face our forces are bound to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a privilege to discuss these matters with the Secretary of State, but I fancy that he will have been unable to satisfy the people of Scotland that his Government's stewardship deserves congratulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The concluding remarks of the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East were completely irresponsible. I welcome the Secretary of State for Defence to the Scottish Grand Committee in Cupar. He can see for himself the Committee's success, which yesterday the BBC spent an unusual amount of time denigrating. It did not appear to understand that measures were considered extremely successfully in Grand Committees and Standing Committees. I expect all members of the Committee were tuned in to the excellent interview with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that people in London cannot understand the procedure in the Grand Committee and in Standing Committees. They ask ridiculous questions about BSE, not understanding that the Government's policy and that of the National Farmers Union for Scotland is exactly the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the problem that the programme concerned was produced by people in London?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend. Those who do so much to promote all parties and political views in Scotland do an excellent job. I was critical of what happened yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for coming to Fife, where there has been so much good news about incoming investment from Locate in Scotland, from my right hon. Friend and from my hon. Friend the Minister for Industry and Local Government. We can look forward to an increase in the number of jobs in the not-too-distant future. That is indeed good news and it would be a great tragedy if it was all destroyed by the idea that it is time for a change, for a windfall tax and a tartan tax, all of which would be disastrous for the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warmly welcome what right hon. and hon. Members in the Committee have said about the part played by Scottish service men and women down the ages in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
defence of our country. The point should be brought home to the SNP—whose members are again absent—that a greater percentage of operational strength has moved north into Scotland than in the past. The strike capability at Leuchars, Lossiemouth and Kinloss compared with that of the Royal Air Force in England shows that RAF defence in Scotland has increased dramatically, which we should welcome. I look forward to further developments in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we are on the subject of Lossiemouth, we should pay tribute to 202 squadron and its search-and-rescue work in Scotland, with help from the Navy at Prestwick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>It is incredible that the SNP thinks that it could maintain those three large RAF stations without knowing how they will be paid for and what their tasks will be. The SNP is conning the people based at those RAF stations, who should make their voice heard at the general election.</p>
	<p>We thank the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Scotland for the imaginative idea of bringing back the fine, historic, 602 squadron Spitfire to Glasgow; it will be given a tremendous welcome by the 602 squadron association. As I said earlier, 602 squadron was the first royal auxiliary squadron to be formed in 1925, followed by the city of London, the County of London and the City of Edinburgh 603 squadron, of which I was a member.</p>
	<p>I lead my right hon. Friend an inch further. Bearing in mind that the Spitfire will take a little time to restore and repair to be ready for exhibition, perhaps one of the splendid plastic model Spitfires, such as the one at Edinburgh airport, could be placed at Glasgow airport until the original is ready. It is a tremendous idea that will be warmly welcomed by all members of the Royal Air Force. We should remember that 602 squadron had an exceptional war record under the command of Air Vice Marshal Sandy Johnstone—now retired—and included among its members Archie McKeller, who was probably the greatest Scottish fighter pilot during the war.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot go as far as my right hon. Friend would wish because those replicas, although splendid things, are all positioned at RAF stations and would have to be removed from there to another place. At one stage, I was asked whether, instead of returning the LA198 to Glasgow, it would be possible to send a plastic replica in its place. That would not do. Scotland must have its proper Spitfire back and it has to go to Glasgow. I apologise to my right hon. Friend for having to wait for the real thing. It will take a little longer than the ersatz model, but it will be worth it in the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree with the ultimate objective, but I am worried that many of the 602 squadron fighter pilots will not be around in a few years time to see the return of the original. However, I am thrilled by my right hon. Friend's remarks and I am sure that its return will be a great boost to the west of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside is the great expert on air cadets, so I say only in passing that we should bear in mind the fact that they, as well as the Army and Navy cadets, are extremely worth while and do tremendous good in
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Scotland in keeping boys and girls off the streets and doing something constructive. I hope that we can maintain the opportunities for them to go to camps and be involved in the services because it is a wonderful apprenticeship to life in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to have my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in Scotland without acknowledging that many of our constituents have problems with low-flying aircraft. I stand up for the high standard of training that is essential to the Royal Air Force and acknowledge that low flying is an essential part of that training. However, I have always said that we should ensure that the load is spread fairly over all the low-flying areas in the United Kingdom and, of course, abroad in Canada. I believe that that is now the policy and, by and large, everyone has an equal share of what is an essential part of the flying training of the Royal Air Force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) is not here, but we are all awaiting with interest the decision on the air traffic control centre. I hope that one of the two centres will be maintained at Prestwick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has spent a considerable time dealing with the Army. He was right to do so because of the tremendous reputation that Scottish regiments have in Scotland and throughout the world. I am glad that I played a part in the campaign to save the Scottish regiments after "Operations for Change". I believe that we should have gone all the way and retained the two Highland regiments, instead of asking them to amalgamate, even though it has now become one of the very best battalions in the Army. I believe, too, that the Army is right to think again about recruiting offices because there should be a focal point. All the services now need to accept that because they are grouped in such small numbers all over the country and the average civilian sees very little service activity. That is disappointing. We should keep a close connection between the services and everyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more that we can keep services above the parapet in our constituencies, the better. We should be promoting them through the Territorial Army and the Territorial and Volunteer Reserves Associations and so on, which all have a part to play in helping to achieve a high level of local involvement in events such as Remembrance Sunday and many other activities. They should be letting the people and local papers know what it is like being in camp and in service abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Territorial Army is doing well, as indeed is the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the various squadrons in Scotland. There is the maritime headquarters unit, which perhaps my right hon. Friend will see at Leuchars this afternoon. It now has a medical flight, as well as headquarters in Edinburgh. "Options for Change" says that the future is in the reserves, but in two or three years time we will find that they are not as big as they were. It is important to hold on to our reserves because that is how to support our front-line troops in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All in all, my right hon. Friend made a satisfactory statement, which was full of encouragement and prospects for the future. It would be the greatest disappointment to all those in the services if there were a change of Government in the spring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Dumfries. I agree with a number of his remarks, not least his comments about the burden on our constituents with the problem of low-flying training, which should be shared more fairly around the country. I also agree that the average civilian does not know much about the armed forces. This particular average civilian has learnt a little about the armed forces in recent years from being a member of the Select Committee on Defence, along with the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East, and by spending 21 days with the Army under the armed forces parliamentary scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have, therefore, been hearing a bit about the anxiety of those currently serving in the armed forces. Colleagues from all parties in the Defence Committee are looking forward to the opportunity to take evidence from the Secretary of State for Defence on Wednesday when we know the outcome of the Budget. Having heard of the anxiety, the overstretch and the undermanning in the armed forces, we want to know the direction the Government are taking. Clearly, there is a need for a proper review of the defence budget so that the tasks that we expect our armed forces to do are brought into balance with the resources and manpower that they are given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been fundamentally dishonest over the years in cutting again and again the resources and manpower of the armed forces while adding more to their workload, whether in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Cyprus, the Falkland Islands or wherever. I am very concerned about the level of overstretch and overwork being endured by those currently serving in the armed forces. The Government should stop taking liberties with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For once, I agree with something that the Secretary of State said. My observations of personnel in the armed forces in recent years have shown clearly that there are Scottish soldiers, sailors and airmen at every level and in every unit. No matter where on goes, they turn up in the most unlikely places. Scotsmen are even serving in what used to be called the Hampshire regiment. They serve as officers and in lower ranks all over the armed services, and as such are part of an extremely efficient and effective force, capable of undertaking a range of operations both in area and out of area. They play a leading part in international coalition NATO and United Nations peacekeeping and peacemaking operations—the sort of operations in which the armed forces will be expected to become involved more and more often. Only last week, the Secretary of State talked about the situation in eastern Zaire and Rwanda. Such operations seem to be viewed from a left-wing perspective nowadays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservatives are, perhaps, more isolationist and reluctant to see our armed forces taking part in activities in areas of which they know little, whereas we on the left of British politics are concerned about humanitarian issues and are anxious to contribute to that sort of operation. Nowhere has that been more clearly visible than in Bosnia. I have seen the activities in Bosnia over the years, both from visits with the Select Committee and as a driver with a convoy crew operated by Edinburgh direct aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that British forces, taking part in such operations, do so not as observers or as a support unit. They are an effective force, capable of
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
intervening at every level. We have seen that in Bosnia, where there is a massive distinction between what British battalions, including a large Scottish element, have been able to do within UNPROFOR and IFOR and the more limited contributions of smaller countries such as Norway and Denmark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I refer to those smaller countries because the Scottish National party has suggested that the forces of an independent Scotland would be broadly equivalent to those of Norway and Denmark. Even the limited contributions to international action of such small countries are possible only because they have many low-paid conscripts in their armed forces. Norway has an army of 33,500, including 22,100 conscripts, and Denmark has an army of 22,000, including 8,500 conscripts.</p>
	<p>The idea of conscripting some SNP skinheads into the Army is appealing in the sense that it might be good for them. I doubt, however, whether the idea would appeal to them and whether it would add much to the strength and intelligence of the armed forces. We need professional armed forces. I yield to nobody in my enthusiasm for Scottish home rule within the United Kingdom, but the value of Britain's armed forces and the key role of Scots in those armed forces are prime reasons for maintaining and developing the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p>The Secretary of State for Defence had much to say about Rosyth in his introductory remarks. He said that there was good news. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] Someone has sent me a note, but I am not sure that I am being helped my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell, North. Perhaps he does not want me to be unkind to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State said that there was good news for Rosyth, but there is still considerable anxiety about the future of the allocated programme of surface ship refits. The Secretary of State has not come clean on that.</p>
	<p>The Secretary of State referred to what he regarded as good news, but I want him to tell us a little more about the bad news. Rosyth should have kept the contracts to refit Trident submarines. It was cheated by the Secretary of State's predecessor, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), on the basis of an unfair assessment in a dodgy competition. The Select Committee on Defence said that at the time, and it has been proved right now that the costs of satisfying the nuclear safety case at Devonport are emerging. We should be told more about that.</p>
	<p>To add insult to injury, the problem of decommissioned nuclear submarines at Rosyth remains. Eleven decommissioned nuclear submarines are at Devonport and Rosyth, and five, including Dreadnought, are at Rosyth. Dreadnought is the oldest and has been lying at Rosyth for 13 years. Nobody knows what to do with it. In June, the Secretary of State for Defence told the Select Committee that reactor compartments in hulks would be removed to the Nirex repository at Sellafield sometime after 2012. I do not believe him.</p>
	<p>If and when it is constructed, the Nirex repository will be designed for convenient packages of waste from nuclear power stations. It will be neither practical nor affordable—let alone sensible—to expect people in the next generation to lift 40—year—old reactors weighting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
hundreds of tonnes out of the docks at Rosyth and Devonport and cut them into radioactive bits for transport and storage at Sellafield. That is not realistic and the Secretary of State knows it. He is spinning a yarn about taking the reactors to Sellafield. He really means to leave them afloat indefinitely as a problem to be faced by future generations. The Secretary of State should come clean.</p>
	<p>It is intolerable to leave these reactors afloat at Rosyth forever, and cutting them up is not a practical option. Therefore, we should be honest and consider other options. In the United States, whole reactors are being buried at a massive underground repository in the desert at Hanford in Washington State. It would be phenomenally difficult to do anything like that anywhere in the United Kingdom, but we should at least be honest and consider realistic destinations for the material. Perhaps we should co-operate with the French, who have a similar problem.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, like me, may be a relative layman in nuclear physics. I dare say each of us relies on what we are told. I am advised, in all seriousness and in all sincerity by people whose judgment I trust, that the long-term disposal route for the reactors in submarines is disposal in the long-term repository to be constructed by Nirex at some date after 2012.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that it is sometimes tempting to use colourful language, but I not like the hon. Gentleman saying that he does not believe me and that he thinks I am spinning a yarn. I am not spinning a yarn, and I hope that he will believe me. I have outlined the advice that I have been given. Although, to the lay mind, the idea of cutting up nuclear reactors is challenging, we have been advised that we will be able to do that. My advice is that that represents a safe course of action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is remarkably convenient advice for the Secretary of State. It kicks a difficult issue 15 years forward when he will not be the Secretary of State for Defence. Problems are always being dealt with in that way. Meanwhile, the hulks remain in the docks gathering barnacles and the problem will be left to the next generation. Frankly, I do not think that it is credible to expect members of the next generation to lift such massive pieces of engineering out of the water, cut them up into little bits, repackage them while exposing workers to radioactivity, transport them across the country and then lower the material into a deep repository at Sellafield that was designed for something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities in the United States are probably approaching the problem much more realistically. The Secretary of State should come clean. Decisions should be taken properly now; they should not be ducked and kicked into the future. The Secretary of State is being irresponsible. The disposal of that material is one issue that affects people at Rosyth and on both sides of the Firth of Forth. There should be an open and proper public debate about it rather than kidding people that the decision can be put off indefinitely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
When we discussed the problems of recruiting and retention, it was interesting that the hon. Member for Motherwell, North forgot to mention the fact that in March 1979 we were at the height of the cold war. At that time, everyone was well aware of the need to have our defences fully active and ready to operate in the event of possible Soviet expansion. That is not the same as the situation we face today. The Soviet Union has collapsed, the Berlin wall has fallen and a move towards so-called peace, with its benefits, has been generated out of that. I have always believed that peace was what one got from deterrence and from preventing others from attacking. Like the hon. Gentleman, I believe that we should keep and maintain our forces at a level that will deter adequately and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East had to admit that, when the crunch came and the job had to be done, we did it. The Harriers and Tornados had been serviced to a high standard, and tha—and to what we talk about—is what matters. The crucial issue is whether our chaps were capable of doing the job. Before, the hon. and learned Gentleman intervenes, I must point out that Don McClem of British Aerospace is an old Royal Air Force friend of mine and a great pal. I do not need any lessons from the hon. and learned Gentleman on what British Aerospace did in the Gulf. Don told me—he was in charge, if the hon. and learned Gentleman did not know—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to intrude on the intimacy of the hon. Gentleman's friendships. However, in the Falklands, the fact that the Harriers were kept flying was directly related to the fact that the work was being done in-house by the Royal Air Force or the Royal Navy. People are now anxious because the obsession with privatisation has given rise to instances like the one to which I referred where 16 aircraft were rendered dangerous and unsafe by a private company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman displays his complete ignorance of military history. He should know that during periods of difficulty in the past reservists were employed by civilian contractors. Those were the people who were used. He should look up the history of the Korean war. He is always making snide remarks so I am delighted to tell him that my honorary appointment has been extended to 1999. I have to declare that as it is one of my interests, Mr. Stewart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to what is happening at Hughes, GEC Ferranti, Pilkington Optronics, IBM, Rolls-Royce, British Aerospace, Yarrows and, of course, Babcock at Rosyth. We thank my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for his comments and the orders to which he has referred, which are vital to the well-being of Scotland. Babcock has done a remarkable job at Rosyth, and that should be on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that the Scottish National party's defence policy is nothing short of crazy. How could it possibly consider withdrawing from NATO and imagine that we could defend our massive coastline and land mass? We could not do that alone. If it imagines that it could just turn to its neighbours south of the border and say, "Would you send us up three squadrons of Tornadoes and some Nimrod 2000s. Oh, and while you are at it, could you make sure you have enough helicopters to carry out all the other surveillance and rescue work that we need if we are going to deploy that kind of aircraft?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
The SNP policy is absolute nonsense. It has never attempted to address the huge cost of maintaining Kinloss, Lossiemouth and Leuchars. As I have asked before, what type of aircraft does it plan to fly from those top-rate, internationally first-class bases? I imagine that a few Chipmunks will be available because the Royal Air Force will have them to sell. They may be of some interest. But quite honestly, it is time that we pointed out that one cannot sit down with a pencil and paper and work out on percentage terms how defence contracts are carried out. That is not how defence works. Certainly, since the early 1800s, Scotland has contributed up to 20 per cent. of the United Kingdom's defence personnel. That is important even today after the run-down that we have had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come briefly to the reserves and the auxiliaries. As we know, my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Dumfries is connected directly with the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. Like him, I am delighted that the Spitfire is coming back to Glasgow. I am also a bit worried that some of the chaps who flew the Spitfires are getting a bit long in the tooth, but I hope that it will be back in time for them to enjoy it before they move on to the other Valhalla above.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider much more carefully how we balance the recruiting of reserves and auxiliaries throughout the United Kingdom. Historically again the Scots have made a massive contribution to the territorial, auxiliary and volunteer reserve commitments. In that sense I want to draw attention to the fact that the cadets, particularly the air cadets with whom I am directly concerned, have a superb recruitment and retention figure for Scotland. The gliding units at Arbroath, Kinloss and Kirknewton are vital. They must be retained for the training of air cadets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Boys and girls of 16 who learn to fly solo a £30,000 aircraft of Her Majesty—and that is what these power gliders or conventional gliders cost—are unlikely to steal cars for thrills. It is much cheaper to keep good youngsters good than to try to make bad youngsters good. Although the Committee finds that amusing, that is why I have devoted all of my adult life, including my regular years in the service, to working for the air cadets. I do not apologise to those who find it amusing because my wife knows that over the years at weekends, when others were out golfing and enjoying other activities, like other instructors I was out teaching youngsters to fly and glide. We did that because we sincerely believed that it is less expensive to keep good youngsters good than to try to make bad youngsters good. I want the Committee to remember the tremendous number of Scots who are involved in that sort of voluntary activity. There are many of them. We should be very proud of them. I welcome the opportunity to stand here today to commend them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that I am one of those who want to see the National Air Traffic Services privatised. That will not surprise many colleagues because down the years I have had to move amendments to Bills—I have had air waves bent as a result of what air traffic was doing and understand that air space is important to all users of it. I want to see the NATS privatised. I want to see the lessons of privatisation applying, and that really means much more money being raised to fund the necessary development of the NATS. It will cost a lot of money,
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
and that is better done in the private sector as all the evidence of British Airways and others involved in aviation demonstrates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to see privatisation put on hold. I want to see the new centre built at Prestwick, but we have no God-given right in this country to control the air space over the Atlantic. Our right to control that air space is because our facility is the finest that is available. That will not continue unless we invest heavily in modern and new equipment. That is best done through the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I preface my remarks by thanking you, Mr. Stewart, fellow members of the Committee and the staff for the kindness that has been shown to me since the shock and distress that I experienced on arrival here this morning. I should like to make a few remarks that will necessarily be short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Secretary of State, I should like to pay great tribute to the armed forces personnel for all the work that they do in peacekeeping and responding to emergencies, both foreign and domestic. I am well aware of that from my constituency experience. Living as I do in Lossiemouth, I have close and regular contact with the personnel at Kinloss and Lossiemouth, two bases that I know extremely well. I know the commitment of the people who work there, both the armed services personnel and the civilians. They carry out the duties that are required of them under the Queen's regulations and they do a great deal of good work in our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also particularly proud of our local search-and-rescue facilities. This year there has been a record number of searches and rescues, most of which have successfully returned people from life-threatening situations. Many of those involved tell me that they feel that there is lack of direction in defence policy; it was much easier for them during the cold war when they knew who the enemy was and in which direction their guns were pointed. We are now seeing changes in all these alliances. NATO is now working alongside countries that were previously in the Warsaw pact. We have varying views across Europe on the development of the Western European Union and the European Union as to how common foreign and defence policy might be developed. We also have Partnership for Peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to rehearse many of the arguments that have been advanced about Army recruitment, but I should like to mention the Merchant Navy, which has not received much attention. In the past five years only one out of 143 vessels chartered for exercises was British. During the Gulf war, five of 162 ships chartered by the United Kingdom were UK ships. That says much about the demise of the Merchant Navy. That problem must be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Secretary of State acknowledged, I wrote to him several weeks ago about the implications of Nimrod 2000 for RAF Kinloss. Rumour and counter-rumour have stirred up uncertainty about this. I hope that a decision will soon be taken to put the minds of those concerned at rest, particularly as so much money has been spent on developing facilities at RAF Kinloss. It would seem ridiculous under most criteria not to deploy Nimrod 2000 there. The lack of a heavy lift capacity for outsized loads is also a matter for concern in the RAF. The United Kingdom relies on the USA's Galaxy facilities.

Some comment has been passed on Scottish National party defence policy. Some of the reactions seemed similar to the knee-jerk reactions on publication of our discussion document. Comments were made by people who had not even seen it. The Scottish National party has published a document and, having put it in the public domain, is prepared to discuss it. However, we do not aim to build an isolationist Scotland. We want Scotland to be involved in international alliances, but it will be for the people of Scotland to decide upon the alliances in which they wanted to be involved. We have also spelt out the fact that the Scottish National party is an anti-Trident party. We are the only political party in Scotland that oppose Trident's being in our waters. The cold war was over before Trident was delivered to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no plans to introduce conscription. We are opposed to it, as speech after speech has made clear. We have discussed our document in detail with senior military personnel. That was a quite major input. We have analysed our document using statistics gleaned from parliamentary questions at Westminster, documents published by the Ministry of Defence, and international comparisons. I am proud of the defence document published by the Scottish National party and I look forward to the publication of such documents by some other parties in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I extend my and my colleagues' sympathy to the hon. Member for Moray in her awful predicament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put some precise questions to the Secretary of State for defence. The first is directed both to him and the Secretary of State for Scotland. It arises from a briefing that was given to some hon. Members in Edinburgh with the involvement of Sir Robert Easton and GEC-Marconi. The problem concerns funding of fundamental research. Sophisticated operations such as the ECR90 radar and electro-optic technology require clarity about who finances the necessary research. David Newlands, the finance director, told us that the company would finance research only in areas where it could see sales. From the point of view of GEC-Marconi that approach might be fine. From Britain's point of view it might be far from fine. That raises the question of the financing of fundamental research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry of Defence has some moral obligations to deal with the issue that I have raised. If we are to produce highly sophisticated civilian and military equipment, at the frontiers of technology, such as certain radar, we should have a clear grasp of who is to provide finance for university research. The Ministry has some responsibility in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question relates to shortfall. Is the figure that has been given of a rise of 541 by Christmas disputed? My hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid) referred to 100 men from the Gurkhas. I ask about this as the Royal Scots recruit in my area, and also because of my genuine interest in the Gurkhas. I was fortunate enough to go to Pokharra with the IPU in January, as part of a delegation led by the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir J. Stanley). We saw the Gurkhas training. There is an argument identified by Colonel Kefford in his paper, which the Secretary of State for Defence has, relating to the movement of
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
Gurkhas for equal treatment of accompanied service. When the Army Board made a welcome visit to Scotland I raised that issue with Sir Charles Guthrie, Sir William Rous and their colleagues. The matter is urgent if we are to have good relations with the Royal Scots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question concerns recruitment. Every regiment posted to Northern Ireland or Bosnia apparently has to borrow from elsewhere. In the light of the speech made by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) I ask whether that is an infantry problem. I understand that the sappers and the other logistics corps do not have such a problem. Is that difference to do with the fact that they offer and are perceived to offer a technical training? Does that have implications for infantry recruitment? I wonder, too, whether it is wise to rely on jobcentres rather than recruiting officers. There seems to be a lack of an Army presence behind the counter. As has been said, the official behind the counter, not being a soldier, is unlikely to tempt the undecided to take the Queen's shilling. I understand the Treasury pressure to have the work done by jobcentres, but now that experience of that method has been obtained, does it appear entirely wise, and does it save money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that even the pipers and drummers who symbolise what being a Scottish soldier is all about undertake their training at York. Does that help recruitment? Many youngsters are more likely to join a regiment traditionally linked with their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth question concerns my understanding, which the Secretary of State for Defence will correct if it is wrong, that of 20,000 applicants to join the services last year, 9,000 failed to make the grade because they were not up to it physically. That figure would have real consequences for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question to last has to do with Zaire. On Thursday I was given an excellent briefing by Air Vice-Marshall Tony Harrison of the Air Staff, in the presence of the Minister of State, who invited me to the Ministry of Defence. One cannot be other than impressed by the mind-boggling and extraordinary capacity of Canberra reconnaissance to identify from thousands of feet up even the badges of personnel on the ground. I have, as the Secretary of State for Defence knows, expressed on the Floor of the House the gravest doubts about going into Zaire: those who decide to send troops in had better be very clear about the circumstances in which they can be pulled out, because entry is always more easy than exit. However, I shall confine my question to Scots troops. What preparations are they given for an almost impossible operation of the kind that is involved in the present case? I let the parliamentary delegation to Zaire in 1990 and know something about the matter, with which I have kept up. It really is a difficult terrain in which to put troops and we have to be very clear about the objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsidiary part of my question concerns inoculations. Given all that has been said about cocktails of inoculations, is the Ministry of Defence quite happy to put troops into central Africa, if indeed that is the final decision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it was 34 years ago that I was first asked to see a Secretary of State for Defence. I went with Peter Thornycroft to discuss Scots troops taken prisoner during the Korean war and whether there was a possibility of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
ever locating contemporaries and friends of mine at basic training in Catterick. Since then, I have had several long interviews in the Ministry of Defence, which has been uniformly helpful. The records division in particular has been to a great deal of trouble. Given the 5,000 mile distance and the state that Russia is in, it is entirely conceivable that there could be camps in Kamchatka or somewhere that have developed a life of their own. As General Volkonigov raised the matter of British and American prisoners from all those years ago, I wonder whether anything was said in Moscow to the Defence Secretary about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following what my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian said, was anything mentioned in Moscow about what is happening with the former Soviet artic fleet—which might be an even more urgent environmental problem than the hulks that go south—and what we can do to help it? Nirex has been mentioned. I had the chance at the Labour party conference to talk to Dick Morris—Sir Richard Morris, the chairman of Nirex—who has clear ideas about what could be done if Britain and Russia agreed on a graveyard for those difficult problems created by nuclear submarines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My time is up. If the Secretary of State cannot answer my questions today, I will be grateful to hear from the Ministry of Defence later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend who, as part of a long parliamentary tradition, posed detailed and difficult questions to the Secretary of State for Defence. He is one of few hon. Members for whom the House falls silent when he asks Ministers questions, and I want to pick up on his excellent points about Moscow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, when I heard that the Secretary of State for Defence was in Russia, I wondered whether he was looking for a new job in anticipation of the outcome of the general election, given that the head of the defence Ministry in Russia seems to be continually changing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Secretary of State for Defence has come to Fife today. Like many others, I speculated on his reasons for that. I am delighted to hear of his Fife connections and, indeed, of his recognition of the contribution of the people of Scotland to the defence of the realm. I hoped that he would bring some good news for Rosyth which has endured not just months but years of uncertainty as a direct result of the Government's policies. As I have already said to the Secretary of State, while I welcome the good news that he has given to Rosyth this morning, I believe that it is limited and will disappoint the work force which is looking for definite guarantees and detail on the future work load for the yard, on terms and conditions and on the future entitlements under the pension scheme. Although the Secretary of State mentioned negotiating terms and conditions and a redundancy buy-out, he did not provide sufficient information to ensure that the work force of Rosyth—who co-operated in reaching agreements on their terms and conditions—will receive the buy-out that they wanted and of which they are anxious to hear news.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to deal briefly with those points and will be happy to do so at greater length another time.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must have been overwhelmed by the fact that the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of State for Defence and the Minister were willing to come face to face with the work force whose loyalty and commitment they have betrayed over the past six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Defence said nothing concrete about the future of the work force at the Royal Naval support establishment and the supply stores, even though in 1992 the Prime Minster said that Rosyth naval base would continue to play an important role in Britain's defence. It was finally shut down this year. We want a far more detailed statement on the conclusion of the negotiations on Rosyth 2000. Investors interested in Rosyth are unable to get clear answers because the negotiations have been so protracted. As the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East and my hon. Friends said, when the Minister and the Secretary of State make the point about needing to agree prices they should realise that the dockyard has been waiting four years for an agreement on prices. Time and again, the problems have been not at Rosyth, but at Devonport, which is an example of the Government putting their political interests beyond those at prices and costs. In talking about submarine refitting and Trident, the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East also made the point about an £800 million overspend on building work at Faslane.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A tremendous tribute to the work force of Rosyth and the work forces involved in defence across Scotland, including service personnel, is that in spite of the awful insecurity resulting from the Government's policies, they have always put the defence of the realm first, which is more than the Government have done. The Government's defence policy has been led by the Treasury. Short-term savings have allowed the Chancellor to announce some pretend tax cuts. I will be interested to hear the Secretary of State's assurance that tomorrow the Chancellor will not do what he did last year when he followed up £750 million of defence savings with a further £686 million of cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have said, the Government have slashed defence spending by more than any other Government. Service personnel strength has been cut by 29 per cent. since 1992 and overall expenditure since
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
1985–86 has been cut by 27 per cent. Our armed forces are severely overstretched and morale has plummeted. The Government are not to thank for the fact that the British armed forces still depend crucially on those from the north of England or from Scotland for service and recruitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Opposition Members—in particular, my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow—discussed the defence manufacturing industry. The Government have taken little account of the important role that the civilian work force and our manufacturing industry play in defence. We have lost hundreds of thousands of highly skilled workers. As one of my hon. Friends said, it is not just Labour Members who complain about the Government's defence procurement policy; representatives from the General Electric Company, the Babcock International Group and British Aerospace—and anyone else whom one talks to—also do so. They have criticised the delays that have characterised the Government's defence procurement decisions, which have caused many companies to lose money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Dumfries discussed the new investment for Fife, which is good news. I know that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who has responsibility for industrial and regional development, is also keen to discuss it. I welcome the investment that has come to Fife—especially to west Fife—and the recent announcement involving Hyundai.

I am sure that the Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland recognise that the new investment resulted from the work of the South Fife partnership, which includes Fife council, the Scottish Office, Fife Enterprise and other groups. The months and years of work that they put in have now paid off. Although the new investments are greatly welcomed, however, jobs are lost far more quickly than they are created. The new investment will not for some considerable time—if ever—make up for the severe job losses that Fife experienced as a result of military spending reductions and the closure of traditional industries, including mining. Fife is only now beginning to benefit from its restored development area status, which was granted in 1993 but which it had lacked for the previous nine years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East detailed some examples of waste. I do not have enough time to discuss that matter in as much detail as I should wish, but I must agree with his comments about search and rescue. I remember when a previous Secretary of State for Defence—the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands—announced in 1993 that there would be a new national search and rescue co-ordination centre at Pitreavie castle. However, less than one year later, he said that that decision had been scrubbed. It appeared that the centre would be based at Leuchars, but, lo and behold, that decision also changed. That is why people in this part of the world often believe that the Government's policies are characterised by ducking, diving, dodging and deceit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For once, I agree with a comment of the hon. Member for North Tayside: he said that the Scottish National party's policy—especially its proposal to withdraw from NATO—was crazy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I praise the point that several of my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian, made about the value of Britain's armed forces and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
key role that Scots play in those armed forces. I also agree with the point that the hon. Member for Moray made about the reduction of the merchant fleet and its crucial role in this country's defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's defence policy resembles a ship that is captained by a Secretary of State who does not know his port from his starboard and which is steered by a Chancellor whom no one—not even those on the Government Front Bench—agrees with or is happy to work with. The best way to bring stability to the armed forces and to our defence policy—and the best way to rebuild morale—is to return a Labour Government at the general election in a few months' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Labour Government will try to negotiate this country's role and future commitments with all our allies. Our defence forces and our defence manufacturing industry need a clearly defined future. The work force at Rosyth, the people of Fife and those Scottish people who commit themselves loyally to this country's defence deserve a secure future to which we can all look forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure to reply to the debate. I associate myself and my colleagues with the comments made about the distressing circumstances suffered by the hon. Member for Moray. I pay tribute to her courage and dedication to the Committee, for staying throughout the sitting and for delivering her speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to welcome to Fife my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, who has family connections with the region—I am happy to welcome him home. I was glad to hear his welcome announcement about Rosyth. In his speech he clearly set out the strength of Scottish interest in a wide range of defence matters. He described the strategic facilities involved including, for example, the base for the Navy's nuclear deterrent. He also mentioned the defence forces' vital support services—including the Army personnel centre in Glasgow—the significant economic benefit derived from defence contracts in the shipbuilding and electronics sectors and the research projects undertaken by academic institutions. They all demonstrate the mutual benefit that arises from Scotland's stake in the United Kingdom's defence role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate for my right hon. Friend to discuss those matters in the kingdom of Fife. That kingdom made a significant contribution to our defence strategies through the support of key establishments, including RAF Leuchars. It has also shown its strong capacity to adjust to the world's changing defence climate and it still makes a vital contribution to important facilities, including the Rosyth royal dockyard. Scotland's major defence contractors are also strongly represented in the kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Motherwell, North did not disappoint me with his speech—it was a load of hot air in which he ran down everything that we have done but offered nothing in return. He showed a singular lack of knowledge about what is going on in Scotland, which surprises me because many benefits have gone to his constituency. Those benefits have resulted from the work of Locate in Scotland and Scottish Enterprise.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
The hon. Gentleman called for a defence diversification agency. Scottish Enterprise has already set up a Scottish defence initiative to deal with the effects on business of the defence review that is associated with "Options for Change". He should join in the praise that came late in the day from the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West. She praised the successes that occurred in Fife. According to the projected losses that would result from changes in our nation's defence, about 4,600 civilian jobs have been lost either at the base or the dockyard or in defence-related industries elsewhere in Fife since 1991. The hon. Member for Dunfermline, West failed to point out—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to complete the story. In the five years to March 1996, 45 inward investment projects were brought to Fife along with about £200 million-worth of planned investment. More than 5,000 jobs were created or safeguarded. Now Hyundai has added the prospect of at least 2,000 jobs in the Dunfermline area. In addition, when Rosyth 2000 was named as the successful preferred bidder for the Rosyth base, it mentioned thousands of jobs for the Fife area, if I recollect correctly. That is good news for Fife and for diversification in the changing circumstances of the defence industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of that could come about if the Labour party's policies were to be adopted. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) must be only too well aware that inward investment would be severely hampered if the Labour party signed up to the social chapter in Europe. Inward investors tell us that day in, day out—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why are they coming?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shows his usual ignorance in asking why the investors are coming—they are coming because we have signed up to an opt-out from the social chapter and they recognise the benefits that that brings to the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister seriously think that the Committee and the public outside believe that major inward investors, making huge investments in Scotland—£2.3 billion in the Hyundai case—have not taken into account the fact that there might be a change in the Government next year and that the new Government are likely to sign up to certain policies? Is the Minister trying to tell the Committee that the inward investors believe that a Conservative Government will be in office into the distant future? Is that what he is saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's party has made many utterances during the past few years. The Government costed those the other day. It was estimated that since the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) took over the leadership of the party, Opposition spokesmen have made 89 pledges which would require about £30 billion-worth of extra public expenditure. Yet the day after that expenditure was outlined to the House of Commons, what
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
happened? The Labour leader said, "These aren't pledges—they are not in the manifesto". What should people believe the Opposition stand for?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inward investors, especially those in defence-related sectors, examine the policies of the Government of the day and recognise the competitive environment within which they must operate. It is because of that, and because of the partnership, referred to by the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West, between the local authorities, local enterprise companies and the Scottish Office, that we have had such remarkable success. I sometimes wish the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East were a little more understanding of that point. Perhaps the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West, who has come to the issue late in the day, might explain to her right hon. Friend the benefits that have accrued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Motherwell, North referred to recruitment and pay in the armed forces. It was interesting to hear his comments because he was asked quite specifically whether he advocated increased levels of pay or salary in the armed forces and if he would make a pledge to that effect. I know that my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Defence and for Scotland would like that challenge to be answered, but the hon. Gentleman went quiet at that point. In just the same way, the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) remained silent when asked by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South, who is responsible for education, to come up with a figure for education. Over the weekend, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland challenged the hon. Member for Hamilton to say whether he would do what we have pledged to do—to increase spending on the health service in real terms—and stand by a further increase. Of course, answer came there none, but the challenge stands and the Labour party is found wanting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate, we heard interesting contributions from my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside, who welcomed the return of the Spitfire—the LA198—to Scotland. I know that it means a lot to both of them and to their colleagues who fought in the armed forces or are involved in the forces now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East represents the constituency that contains RAF Leuchars, so I find it quite depressing that he does nothing but run down the successes of the armed forces. That is, perhaps, typical of the Liberal Democrats who are too woolly to be trusted with the defence of the nation. Those are not my words, but those on page 34 of the Liberal Democrat strategy paper "Towards 1996".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Liberal Democrat Members do not like that because, as usual, they are totally incapable of coming up with a positive policy on any topic in Scotland and are unwilling to recognise the successes occurring around them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There followed contributions from the hon. Members for East Lothian, for Moray and for Linlithgow. As I said earlier, I commend the hon. Member for Moray on her courage and determination in making her speech. I only wish that the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Salmond), the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
leader of the Scottish National party, had seen fit to give more respect to the Committee and to the subject under discussion today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am not wrong, but it seems that the hon. Gentleman appeared at the beginning of the debate, had his photograph taken and left not just the Committee, but Cupar too. If that is the hon. Gentleman's commitment to Scotland, I hope that the people of Cupar will recognise it and ensure that the rest of Scotland knows it too. The hon. Gentleman is a man of headlines with no content. That is typical of his party. I notice that the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham), who arrived late, has not risen to his defence. I am prepared to give way to the hon. Lady if she wants, but I do not think that there is any defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries mentioned low flying. Initial findings from the review on the distribution of low flying throughout Great Britain suggest that the borders experience no more than their proportionate share of routine low flying. They experienced less than the British average in 1995.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent a constituency where low flying takes place and I know that at times people suffer from a succession of low-flying exercises. I should have thought that, as an expert on defence matters as he claims to be, the hon. Member for East Lothian would recognise the need to train our young pilots to ensure that they become the best possible quality pilots and that the training is necessary—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> My right hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Friend the Secretary of State suggests that the hon. Member for East Lothian owns much of his constituency so is probably prone to see more aircraft.

The Labour party is calling for a defence review. The Labour party conference would cut the armed forces by about £4.5 billion—the equivalent of abolishing the entire Royal Navy. For six years running, conference voted to cut British defence spending to the western European average and it would have done so again in 1995 and 1996 if the little cabal in Islington, led by the right hon.

	<div class='title'>Contract (Scotland) Bill</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL. J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the Contract (Scotland) Bill in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
The Contract (Scotland) Bill will implement the recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission's report, "Three Bad Rules in Contract Law". 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members must be quiet when leaving the Committee Room. There should not be conversation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to the Scottish Law Commission for the excellence of its reports, especially in this instance. They were produced after extensive consultation following publication of the commission's discussion paper No. 97 entitled "Contract Law: Extrinsic Evidence, Supersession and the Actio Quanti Minoris"—the action of the lesser amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its final report, the commission reviewed certain aspects of contract law which gave cause for disquiet, and recommended that three rules which had unfair and invidious effect should be abolished. The consultation process revealed virtually unanimous support for the reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the measures in the Bill are of a technical legal nature, and will be of most interest to the legal profession, they are no less important for that. The reform of the rules will benefit those who enter into contracts, especially those associated with the purchase of houses. The present rules often lead to manifest injustice and have produced confusing and conflicting case law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three rules to be abolished are as follows. First, where a contract appears to have been embodied entirely in writing, extrinsic evidence is not admissible for the purpose of proving additional terms. This is known as the extrinsic evidence rule. Secondly, contract terms agreed between the buyer and seller of a house, usually in the missive of sale, are superseded by the subsequent conveyance of the property unless steps are taken to contract out of the rule. This is known as the supersession rule. Thirdly, a buyer of heritable property cannot, while retaining the property, recover damages for breach of contract by the seller. This is known as the rule against the actio quanti minoris, or the bar on damages when property is retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain briefly how the Bill's provisions will reform the three areas of law. Clause 1 will enable evidence to be led to prove contractual terms which are additional to those in a written document, unless the written contract is expressed in manner which would exclude any such additional terms. The Law Commission was unable to find any justification for retaining the old rule which prevents a party from proving a valid and subsisting term of a contract simply because it does not form part of a written document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
The old rule is replaced by a rebuttable presumption that all the agreed terms of a contract are contained in the contract document. Clause 1 relates only to matters of proof and evidence, not to substantive law. The fact that additional terms can be proved does not mean that they are formally valid or properly constituted. The clause therefore includes a saving for existing statutory provision regarding the constitution, or formalities of execution, of a contract. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) asked which case was referred to. It was the Winston v. Patrick case, and the rule was known by the same name. Clause 2 removes the existing rule that contractual matters agreed between parties are entirely superseded, regardless of the parties' intentions, by a formal deed to implement the agreement even where the deed does not, in fact, implement all the agreed terms. This rule has been criticised because often it frustrates the intention of the parties. For example, a condition may be agreed in the missive of sale of a property as to the condition of a central heating system. At present it is not certain that such an agreement could be enforceable following delivery of the disposition conveying the property. The Law Commission considers that while there cannot be an objection to a rule that a conveyance supersedes a contract in so far as it implements it, this supersession should not extend to terms not implemented by the conveyance. Clause 2 stipulates that terms that are unimplemented or otherwise unfulfilled by a conveyance are not superseded by it. Clause 2 continues to allow parties to contract into the supersession route if they desire to do so for their own purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 abolishes the general rule that a buyer of certain types of property who claims that there has been a breach of contract by the seller is not entitled to retain the property and claim damages based on a diminution in the value of property. It is clear that the main application of this rule relates to house sales: its effect is that a buyer seeking to claim for a breach of contract by a seller is obliged to reconvey the house to the seller before being able to raise the action. Clause 3 will allow a buyer of a house or business to claim damages for breach of contract by the seller without being obliged to return the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's provisions, as I explained, are technical and non-controversial. There are no party political or European implications, and the Bill will not even result in an increase in public expenditure. It merely represents much-needed clarification of the law of Scotland. I strongly commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that the Bill has no implications for European law. I am wondering whether Conservative Back Benchers might want to extend debating time so as to prevent their being in the Chamber standing shoulder to shoulder with the Chancellor of the Exchequer this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Minister read his brief, my hon. Friends were asking each other why the contents could not be explained in words of one syllable. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) said, "Well, George is going to do that". I hate to disappoint the Committee, Mr. Martin, but I do not think that I should take up the Committee's time on that exercise now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
The Minister will be glad to know that the Opposition will not oppose the Bill, which seems well-founded not only on a Scottish Law Commission report but on consultation that began in 1994, which was resumed in 1995 with the publication of a draft Bill. The Bill therefore must in some ways be a model of the way in which legislative proposals should be put through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission's 1995 report had a somewhat more prosaic explicable title than the 1994 report, which the Minister read to the Committee without a mistake. I will not attempt it. A document entitled "Report on Three Bad Rules in Contract Law" pass the Campaign for Plain English test. The same cannot be said for the content of the report. I assume that the title was designed to attract the attention of those who would pay £7.40 for a 34-page document. Someone getting over that threshold no doubt knows enough to get by.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry if what I am about to say catches the Minister unawares; he has many officials close to him, though. Paragraph 1.7 of the paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The discussion paper also deals with the rule that extrinsic evidence is not in general admissible for the purpose of interpreting the terms of a written contract. We make no recommendation in this report for immediate reform of that rule. There are so many exceptions to it that it does not usually lead to harmful results".</p></blockquote>
The paragraph concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but consultation revealed a few areas of potential difficulty and we would like to have an opportunity for further consideration and for further comparative research. We therefore intend to return to this topic in a later report".</p></blockquote>
No later report has been placed before the Committee because the Bill changes the rules of extrinsic evidence in line with the report's suggestions. What evidence has been obtained as a result of the consultation process? Why are the Government introducing legislation without providing the required supplementary evidence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer, so I will leave the details for a later stage. However, I know the Scottish Law Commission and have a great regard for its work. It deserves full support for its recommendations to the Committee and to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Bill. I congratulate the Scottish Law Commission on the reports that it has submitted and on its general work. The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) reflected favourably on the process of consultation. At a Scottish Question Time a while ago my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) asked the Minister of State about consultation over homelessness rules. The Minister of State answered that the consultation would be genuine, which made one wonder about other Government consultation exercises. However, the consultation with the Scottish Law Commission was genuine and much of it is incorporated in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister will give a definitive answer to the hon. Member for Hamilton's question when he replies to the debate, but paragraph 1.7 mentions
	<br><blockquote><p>"extrinsic evidence…for the purpose of interpreting the terms of a written contract".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
We are considering the admissibility of extrinsic evidence for establishing other express terms, and not for the purposes of interpretation. No doubt, the Scottish Law Commission will return to the question of interpretation at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 1 and 2 are designed to give effect to what in almost every case would have been the intentions of the parties. That is an important objective in any legal system. I am grateful to the Minister for confirming the second decision in the case of Winston v. Patrick. That case is analysed in some detail in the Scottish Law Comnmission reports, which make it clear that the decision left conveyancing practice in considerable confusion and uncertainty. Anything that brings a little more certainty to the matter is to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to detract from the Minister's excellent Latin, but the Scottish Law Commission's 1996 report states, in connection with possible law reform, that the phrase "artio quanti minoris" should perhaps be avoided as it is somewhat confusing. However, I am sure that the Minister's excellent presentation of the matter has not confused the Committee. The measure is intended to ensure the more sensible outcomes that would surely expect if they found themselves in the circumstances covered by the proposals. The Minister said that the Bill deserved cross-party support, and I can confirm that the Liberal Democrat party supports it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.13 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill also has the support of the Labour party. Unlike many of the Government's legislative proposals, it has received a broad welcome in my party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 represents an important change. There is a great need for certainty in contracts, and the various exceptions that have arisen mean that the introduction of the rebuttable presumption will bring about a real improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one question about clause 3, in relation to action for damages for breach of contract of sale. I have a memorandum of comments by the Law Society of Scotland on the consultation paper. It makes the point in respect of clause 3 that the whole point of reform is not to obtain damages as such, but to allow the purchaser to make the claim calculated on the reduction in the value of the subject while still retaining the subject and that the proposed reform should make it clear that the calculation is indeed based on the reduction in value. That does not seem to have found its way into the Bill. What has happened in the meantime regarding that consultation to result in it not being taken on board?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Scottish Law Commission on the title of its "Report on Three Bad Rules in Contract Law". It is a pity that it was unable to continue that simplicity of language in the report. Unfortunately, the present state of law does not allow for simplicity of language, much as we would wish that. I have no further comments to make other than to say that I welcome the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the support from all four parties which are represented this morning. Three hon. Members who spoke, including myself, are advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
I can respond briefly to the point made by the hon. Member for Hamilton. Clause 1 deals only with the extrinsic evidence of additional terms, not extrinsic evidence about existing terms. The Scottish Law Commission is to consider that matter further, so I can confirm that my colleague in the faculty of advocates was correct in his off-the-cuff interpretation fo the law. Discussions are going on with the Law Commission about the content of its programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to clause 3, I can confirm that in cases other than those coming under the Sale of Goods Act 1979, a buyer who claims that there has been a breach of
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
contract by the seller is not entitled to retain the property and claim damages based on a diminution in the value of the property. That is considered unfair in many circumstances and out of date, so the new provision simply abolishes the existing rule. That will greatly benefit house buyers, who will be able to keep their properties and sue for damages where appropriate. I strongly commend the Bill to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In many respects this is an appropriate time because Ministers from Brussels attended the Fisheries Council meeting at the end of last week. This is an opportunity for the Minister who is replying to the debate to put on record what the Government found out and what, if any, conclusions were reached. Some of the decisions that are made in such meetings are vital to Scottish village-based industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an appropriate place in which to raise the subject because the kingdom of Fife has had a long and distinguished historical involvement in the industry. Fishing is an important part of the economy of the local region, as it is in my constituency. I know that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) has taken a keen interest in the industry in his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased also to be flanked by my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), who is our spokesman and a well-known enthusiast on this subject. He is a man of drive, energy and commitment if ever the industry needed one. He is a fisherman's friend, if that is not a sweetie—but then he is a bit of a sweetie. The question this morning is whether the Minister will be the fisherman's friend. We shall receive an answer to that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should put it on record that the fisheries Minister is on important business in Norway, dealing with the vexed question—indeed, with the crisis, in the salmon fanning sector. The context in which the debate is taking place is that fishermen face severe and increasing difficulty. They are striving to operate viably and remain within the legitimate bounds of the law under the current rules of the common fisheries policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expectation that we all had in 1983 when the CFP was put in place—that it would deliver an element of stability and security—has not been delivered in practice. In my experience—I am sure that it is the same in the kingdom of Fife—there is deep unrest and dissatisfaction at the current situation. Many people rightly attribute that to the Government's shortcomings in applying the CFP and fighting the industry's corner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put a series of questions to the Minister. It would be kind of him to arrange for written correspondence to fill any gaps. First, I must ask on the industry's behalf what has happened the United Kingdom review that was announced earlier this year by the former fisheries Minister, now the Financial Secretary to the Treasury? He rightly set up an independent United Kingdom unilateral review—we supported him—to study what could be done by our own hands to attend to the industry's problems in the context of the fundamental Europe-wide review in 2002. The consultations were concluded at the beginning of October and it is time that Ministers let the industry know the results of the exercise. Important issues are involved and action is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
In the longer term, looking forward to 2002 and the more strategic review of the CFP, we must persuade the Government that reform of the CFP is urgent. Withdrawal is not an option. There is argument within the industry. The "Save Britain's Fish" campaign is trying to persuade people that withdrawal and unilateral management of fisheries within the United Kingdom is sensible, but we do not take that view. Nor do we think, as the Government seem to, that the CFP is serving the industry well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Urgent action should be taken to ensure that the concept of relative stability is sacrosanct, that the exclusive use of a six to 12-mile belt is protected and enhanced and that zonal management, or regional fisheries, should be encouraged, not just in consultations but by policy making, administration and control. There is a great deal to be said for considering, for example, the North sea or the west coast as a unit and getting those involved in fisheries round the table to take direct decisions about the management of their own stocks. There is a feeling in the industry that enforcement must be promoted on a community-wide basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is dealing with general issues, but as the port of Eyemouth is in his constituency, he will be as concerned as I am about the future of the village-based industry. Is he aware that although the Minister paid a welcome visit to Pittenweem, local fishing interests were worried and, indeed, disappointed that he did not accept their proposal that a task force be established to examine the future of the village-based industry? The nature of that sector's problem is separate and distinct from some of the difficulties to which my hon. Friend referred. Does he share that disappointment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Coming from south-east Scotland, I know that special circumstances obtain in that sector of the industry and that they are being ignored. Strategic decisions are being taken at a much higher level. The more powerful boats can go on much longer trips and the smaller boats in the village-based industry sometimes miss out. I share my hon. and learned Friend's regret that the Government have set their face against those views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a couple of additional points. Flags of convenience and quota hopping are more of an issue for the fleet south of the border. Nevertheless, there is an important principle because there are about 150 quota-hopping vessels on the UK register. What progress is being made? What will the Government do if the European Union agrees capacity cuts, whether over our heads or despite our voting against any cuts, without agreement on flags of convenience? The Prime Minster seems to have made a personal campaign of the issue, but what will happen if the EU takes decisions despite our best endeavours and capacity cuts? The industry wants an answer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On quota hopping and flags of convenience, the industry wants to know what steps the Government will be able to take to deal with retrospection. The intergovernmental conference might be able to introduce protocol amendments to the treaty, which would allow us to deal with such issues in future. However, that would still leave 150 vessels on the register. What can be done about them retrospectively? Proposals have been made to buy out such quota hoppers, and the Government should at least consider financing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must be aware that the Government hope to tackle quota hopping at the IGC discussions. However, the Prime Minster has recently indulged in sabre rattling and said that Britain intends to frustrate progress at the discussions because of the Government's opposition to the European Court's decision on the 48-hour week. Where does that leave the fishing industry? Does that not show the mess that the Government get into when they take such an obstructive course with our European partners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, and that is not a unique example of the Government getting into a mess over Europe. The issues that I have mentioned are important and the Government are playing with the future of local economies and of village-based industry in Scotland. The Government must tell the industry about their proposals for capacity cuts, flags of convenience and other important structural policy matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What proposals have been made on total allowable catches for 1997? There has been talk of 20 per cent. cuts at the negotiations. The industry took a cut last year and a further 20 per cent. cut would take it down to 115,000 tonnes of cod. Those are worrying figures, but the Norwegians are asking for even bigger cuts. Scottish Office Ministers will have to conduct the Norway negotiations robustly if they are to give the industry a viable TAC, which it would live with next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, particularly for village-based industries, to deal with other white fish TACs. The Government could do more to fight for greater access to haddock, whiting and saith, which is important in Eyemouth, in my area. Local fishermen have persuaded me that a precautionary TAC would be perfectly possible, although data on saith is poor. Fishermen can make clean catches of saith and it is a viable fishery. But there is no precautionary TAC and the Government should urgently consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On scrap and build, the row about the multi-annual guidance programme has blocked our access to partnership funding for new boats, which comes from the United Kingdom, the European Union and fishermen. Before the common fisheries policy was implemented, we had a modern, competitive fleet. For some time, we have been unable to replace capacity and our fleet is now ageing. We are increasingly uncompetitive in the market place and that cannot be allowed to continue. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Fife, North-East reminds me that it is also dangerous to go down to the sea and do business in leaking boats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great concern about technical conservation proposals that are floating about at the negotiations. If the Irish presidency pushes us towards a one-net rule, the small village-based boats from north-east Fife and south-east Scotland will find it much harder to go for a mixed white fish and nephrops fishery. That difficulty will be compounded by the combination of diamond and square-panel configurations that is expected for nets. In recent years, we have gone from a 70 mm diamond panel to a suggestion of a 110 mm diamond with an obligation to run a 110 mm square panel next year. That is an unviable combination of rigging for North sea fishery. Ministers should understand that going out to sea from Eyemouth or Anstruther with a net, a 110 mm diamond with a 110 mm square panel, is like fishing for fresh air. It is utterly unworkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
A series of alternative more viable arrangements could be adopted. I acknowledge that these are technical questions; the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Kynoch) would probably not know the difference between a square or diamond net and other equipment—if one or other bit him in the leg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know, however, that the Under-Secretary understands the economic problems of the industry. His ministerial colleague responsible for the industry would also confirm that it is under intense pressure—especially at the village level. The feeling is that not nearly enough is being done to help to secure the fishing fleet's future in Scotland. We are looking to the Minister and his colleagues to put up a robust defence of our fishing interests in Council meetings in order to secure a future for the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) for drawing the Committee's attention to his concerns about the future of the Scottish fishing industry. I am pleased to have the opportunity to allay some of those concerns and to answer some of the questions that he raised. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State with responsibilities for fisheries is unable to be present, but he is today meeting his Norwegian counterpart to discuss salmon farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will welcome the action taken by my hon. Friend last Friday in Brussels, when he presented to Commissioner Bonino a formal request for the urgent introduction of minimum import prices for salmon. In seeking this support for our fish farmers, the Government have had to weigh carefully the broader implications of such an action. We are convinced, however, that the present market difficulties justify this intervention. At the same time, we also have to recognise that minimum import prices will not solve this recurring problem in the salmon market. So my hon. Friend is in Norway today as part of our continuing efforts to work constructively with the industry and with the Norwegian authorities to find a more permanent arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that fisheries issues take my hon. Friend to Oslo is an illustration that this is an international business. We operate in a competitive world; and we need to ensure that we meet the demands of the market place. We have nothing to fear from free competition and liberal trade. But we have to ensure that we are playing by the same set of rules. Free competition has to be fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every one of us is aware of the level of concern and uncertainty about the future of the UK fishing industry. It is not surprise that such concerns are felt particularly acutely in Scotland. Our vessels land about two thirds of the UK catch, and fishing accounts for a higher proportion of economic activity in Scotland than it does elsewhere. That is particularly the case in those communities that are most heavily dependent on fishing as a source of economic activity, both at sea and on land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the sea fishing industry has its fair share of problems, but it also has great opportunities. The Scottish fleet's landings were worth some £330 million by comparison with a UK total of some £590 million. Income for the fleet as a whole was up by 7 per cent. despite restrictive quotas and a reduction in the number of fishing vessels. That income is now being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
shared among fewer boats, thanks to the decommissioning scheme. As a result, with inflation at the low levels achieved by the Government, the profitability of the industry has risen. Employment in the harvesting sector remains at some 8,400, of whom some 7,000 work as fishermen full time. Together with employment in related onshore activities, we estimate that the industry supports more than 20,000 jobs overall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So why are we concerned about the industry's future? The fact is that the natural resources in the sea are finite, and we have taken so much fish out of the sea in recent years that we are jeopardising the ability of some fish species to reproduce. Technical advances mean that fishing technology has become ever more efficient, and the fish are suffering because we are quite simply catching too many of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are those who suggest that everything would be fine if we were only able to withdraw from the common fisheries policy and retreat into UK waters. As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has acknowledged, that is not a responsible for realistic option. I am glad that we agree on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the common fisheries policy, we are guaranteed a certain proportion of fish, irrespective of whether we catch them in Scottish waters or elsewhere. This is the system known as relative stability. The fish, of course, do not know whether they are Scottish, English, Norwegian or Dutch. They are no respecters of national frontiers. We have to find the solution to the problems of fish stocks in the North sea by working together with the other nations fishing there to ensure that our common heritage is safeguarded. When everyone indulges in one-upmanship, everyone loses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to say that the common fisheries policy is perfect—far from it. We wish to see improvements, many of the flowing from the excellent work undertaken by the review group which we established, and which was chaired so ably by John Goodlad from Shetland. Over the coming months, we shall continue to take forward our agenda for reform of the common fisheries policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One particular difficulty is that fishermen have only a limited degree of confidence in the advice that we receive from our scientists about how fish stocks should be managed. How can it be, they say, that we find so many fish when the scientists tell us that they are becoming scarcer? I have no doubt that improved dialogue between scientists, fishermen and fisheries managers, will lead to a broader consensus and appropriate action. That is why my hon. Friend has encouraged the establishment of close contact between our scientists at the Scottish Office marine laboratory in Aberdeen and fishermen's representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that there have already been clear signs of improved mutual understanding. Earlier this year, we took emergency action, together with our partners in the European Union and Norway, to cut substantially the amount of herring being taken in the North sea. Although the pelagic fishermen were far from overjoyed at the prospect, they recognised that the alternative to a complete closure of the fishery would be even worse. Without prompt action, we faced the prospect of a total collapse of the herring stocks in a repetition of the events of the late 1970s. The collapse of herring stocks then had severe knock-on consequences for the onshore herring processors. We must at all costs prevent the repetition of such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) will meet colleagues in Brussels next month to fix next year's total allowable catches for the stocks that we share with both Norway and our European Union partners. That exercise will not be easy; I am afraid that some reductions may be necessary if we are not to play fast and loose with our fishermens' future livelihood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, fisheries conservation is not achieved simply through quota restrictions. There is also a range of other measures that we need to take to minimise the catching of juvenile fish that have not had a chance to spawn. Throwing dead fish back is a terrible waste of good fish. We need to get round the problem as far as we can be ensuring that the fishing gear being used and the mesh sizes of the nets allow juvenile fish to escape unharmed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government took the initiative in setting up a fisheries conservation group, bringing together fishermen, fisheries scientists and administrators to consider what further practical steps might be taken to improve technical conservation. The group has had a series of meetings this year to develop ideas that the industry can support for conserving fish stocks by changes in fishing methods. The outcome of that work has provided a starting point for the United Kingdom's contribution to European Union discussions on technical conservation. We look forward to making further progress on that front in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not much use our adopting progressive conservation rules unless they are properly enforced. In this country, we devote a great deal of time and effort to effective policing. Those who break the rules with impunity may make a short-term personal gain, but they do so at the expense of the rest of the community. If the black market becomes endemic, an increasing burden will be placed on the shoulders of those who abide by the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend told me how impressed he was when he visited Pittenweem—referred to by the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East, earlier this year—by the plain talking of the Fife fishermen—	<i>[Laughter.]</i>—or so my briefing tells me. They argued strongly that if we failed to enforce the quotas and bring offenders to book, we would be penalising those who were prepared to sacrifice short-term gains for longer term benefits. I give the Committee the absolute assurance that we are resolved to do all we can to bring offenders to account in the wider interests of the industry and fishing communities as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commissioners proposed cuts in fishing capacity that go way beyond what the member states consider to be reasonable and practicable. At the same time, we must recognise that some further reduction in the size of the Community fishing fleet will need to be brought about over time if the viability of the industry is to be secured. We need to bring the capacity of the fishing fleet more closely into line with what fish stocks can sustain. Only in that way will we resolve the underlying problem of over-exploitation of a limited resource.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are prepared to help fishermen leave the industry through voluntary decommissioning schemes. We have committed a total of £53 million over five years to achieve the necessary reductions. Over the past four years, we have enabled some 590 vessels to be taken out of the UK fleet, which represents about 8.5 per cent. of fleet capacity. We expect to be very close to achieving our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
targets under the third multiannual guidance programme by the end of this year. In Scotland, a rather lower percentage—just over 6 per cent.—has been taken out over the same period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in the concentration of the UK fleet in Scotland reflects the greater viability of fishing operations north of the border. Nevertheless, some people believe that decommissioning in Scotland has already gone too far and that the future of some fishing communities may have been put at risk. The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East has highlighted the particular problems that are being experienced in East Neuk. It is entirely natural that hon. Members should want to defend the particular interests of their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious to ensure the maintenance of viable economic activity in fishing ports, including the smaller fishing villages around our extensive coastline. However, we are not in the business of picking winners and losers. The market must decide where any rationalisation of the industry should take place. At a time when we are giving priority to voluntary decommissioning, it cannot make sense for us also to offer grants to encourage investment in new boats. I know that some hon. Members are concerned that the fleet is ageing, but it is clear that new boats are still being brought into the Scottish fleet without the need for public subsidy. Such assistance would run completely counter to the need to reduce fishing effort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly says that I have a constituency interest in this matter. The anxiety that many fishermen in my constituency feel at the fact that they are going to sea in boats of 20 years of age or more means that safety is a live issue. They say—and I have no reason to doubt it—that their returns from the market are inadequate to justify further investment in new vessels. If we do not have that investment, the village-based industry will simply fade away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman says but I said a few moments ago that new boats were still being brought into the Scottish fleet without the need for public subsidy. There is an inconsistency in the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument. He wants to reduce the fleet while at the same time providing grants for new boats. However, I shall ensure, that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South takes those concerns on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
We have been careful to make certain that ports have not been left to a fate of steady decline for want of fixed investment. Here in Fife, £500,000 of public funds, including support from the European Union, have been used to upgrade on-shore facilities at Pittenweem. In the constituency of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), we are spending nearly £3 million on the provision of a new harbour at Eyemouth. It is fitting that today's debate coincides with a ground-breaking ceremony in Eyemouth to mark the commencement of work—proof, if proof were needed, that we have every confidence that the Scottish fishing industry will continue to prosper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not prepared to run down our fishing fleet and the ports that depend on it for their livelihoods if our quotas are simply to be snapped up by foreign quota hoppers. It is unacceptable for a foreign-owned and foreign-crewed vessels which rarely visit our ports to fish our quotas and land the fish they catch abroad. That is a crazy situation which runs completely counter to the basis on which the CFP is established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that the European Court of Justice has failed to recognise the fundamental importance of ensuring a strong economic link between national fish quotas and the coastal communities that depend on them. In order to deal with that problem effectively, we are seeking to amend the treaty on European Union. The Government have tabled a proposal for a new protocol that would enable requirements to be laid down to ensure that UK fish quotas provide an economic benefit to UK fishing communities. Parallel steps are being taken to ensure that all fishing vessels in the UK fleet abide by the same rules, irrespective of their foreign origin. The fact of foreign ownership or landing abroad cannot be allowed to permit our regulations to be evaded. Until the quota-hopping problem has been resolved, we have made it plain that we cannot envisage imposing mandatory fleet cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the undoubted difficulties that the Scottish fishing industry is going through, I have no doubt that it has a viable long-term future. To secure that future, we need to establish a level playing field in the European Union, but we also need to conserve the fish stocks on which that future depends. That is the measure of the challenge that we face, but it is also the way in which we shall succeed in preserving our fishing heritage for the benefit of future generations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
