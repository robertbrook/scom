</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and I are aware that there is a prisoners' week in Scotland every year. This week is prisoners' week and the theme today is volunteers. We are discussing mental illness and prisoners, and today is an appropriate day on which to do so. I am sure that the Minister, like me, wishes the chaplains and other volunteers in the Scottish prison service all best wishes this week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The chaplains do invaluable work in prisons and we are very glad to give them whatever support we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 92 refers to hospital direction orders. We tabled the amendments because social workers and other professionals whom we consulted do not see the need for the provision on hospital direction orders because they already exist. The provision could lead to people being punished for being ill when the offence was committed. Implicit in the statements in the Bill concerning genuine illness is a statement of disbelief. We want to probe the Government on the reason for the hospital orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendment No. 92 a hospital direction could be made only if the court was satisfied that a hospital would admit the patient. A hospital may be able, but unwilling, to admit a patient. It may be unwilling to spare a bed for a patient who, when better, will be sent back to prison. There is an anomaly in the provision: if someone is sent back to prison, he may suffer a relapse. A patient with a personality disorder may not be suitable for a hospital direction or may be difficult to manage; the court should make a hospital direction only if it is satisfied that there will be a hospital place available for the patient. Hospitals may be unwilling to accept patients under hospital directions, which could have a disastrous effect on the relationship between patients and hospital doctors. If the doctor and patient know that when the patient is better he will go back to prison, where is the incentive to work together to improve the patient's health?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned to the prisoner—I mean to say the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He looks like a prisoner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is a prisoner of the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our previous sitting I told the Minister that last Saturday I visited a patient who had been admitted to Carstairs under a hospital order. I know the patient and his family well and he is getting on very well in that environment. If a threat was held over him that he could go to prison, it would have a disastrous effect on him and he might relapse to the extent of being even more ill than when he was admitted to hospital. I have known about that example for some time—it was poignant to speak to that young man last Saturday and to realise that we would be discussing the very issues that affect him and other patients in Carstairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must explain why they have introduced the provision. It follows the Reed committee recommendations in England and Wales, but those recommendations do not include a punitive element. The punitive element in the Government's proposals will be far from beneficial—indeed, it will be detrimental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doctors may be reluctant to take patients from the courts in such circumstances. They may want to hold on to a patient for longer than medically necessary if they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
believe that imprisonment would lead to a deterioration in the patient's mental health. The proposed change would put an extremely unfair burden on psychiatric services. The court should make such an order only if it is satisfied that the hospital will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 93 provides that the hospital should be prepared to admit the patient within seven days of the hospital direction. If the patient is so seriously mentally ill that he falls within the criteria laid down by section 17(1) of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984—that is, if his health or safety, or that of other people, are at risk—he needs to go to hospital and should not have to wait for 28 days. Section 22 of the 1984 Act provides that, when the sheriff in a civil admission decides that the patient should go to hospital, that should happen within seven days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment Nos. 97 and 98 would be to ensure that a patient is kept temporarily in another psychiatric hospital—not in a police cell or residential care unit—until he is transferred to the hospital named in a direction. The current wording of clause 5 means that a person may not go to hospital until 28 days after the court has made a direction. Our recommendation is to reduce that period to seven days, but the question arises as to where the patient should go in the meantime, as he will have been found by the court to be seriously mentally disordered. He should not be held in residential care, in a private home or hostel or a police cell—all of which the current wording of the clause would allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unaware of any residential care facilities in Scotland that would be available to keep a seriously mentally ill person in the conditions of security required under a hospital direction. Owing to the Government's failure to conduct a review of services for mentally disordered offenders in Scotland—we have been crying out for one for many years—there are no suitable medium-secure units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be beneficial to delete the provision that residential care could be an option for the court. The court should not be able to require the person to be kept anywhere other than in a hospital. If a person is not kept safe in hospital, there may be a serious risk of suicide or self-harm, particularly because the sentence—the hospital direction—is so devastating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of amendment No. 100 would be specifically to spell out that a member of staff at the hospital takes the offender to hospital. It is to be hoped that that would generally happen immediately after the court hearing—one of the doctors who has given evidence could do it. Although the court could direct that to happen under the general provision in the clause, it is preferable to spell it out in detail. The most appropriate person to take the sick person to hospital would be a staff member of that hospital, not a police officer or social worker. Local authorities are concerned that, for the first time, they will be used in that capacity to take an individual from court to the hospital. They feel that that is totally inappropriate and out of keeping with their professional role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 101 would give effect to a hospital direction lasting for seven days. If the patient were not
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
transferred within seven days, the direction would lapse and the prison sentence would come into effect. If the patient is so ill that he needs to go to hospital before he can start his prison sentence, he should go as soon as possible. Ideally, that should be as soon as the court has made the hospital direction. Entering temporary accommodation could be extremely traumatic for a person in mental distress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 102 is a subsidiary amendment to amendment No. 101. Amendment No. 103 would ensure that, if the Secretary of State wanted to move the patient to another hospital, he must first consult the management of the new hospital—the doctors who are providing the report for the court, the mental health officer who reported to the court and anyone else appropriate. The Secretary of State cannot direct that the patient must go to the state hospital. If a hospital direction has been imposed by the court, it would be unacceptable if the Secretary of State were able to direct that the patient must go to a different hospital from that considered appropriate by the court. Although the clause envisages that that would occur only in exceptional circumstances, it is more likely to occur if 28 days are allowed to elapse between when the hospital direction is made and when the prisoner goes to hospital. That is another reason the Government should accept amendment No. 102, which would change the period to seven days: emergencies would be less likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that the patient was not unduly prejudiced. The Secretary of State should carry out a full investigation before he changes the hospital named in the direction and it would be inappropriate for him to name the state hospital if the court did not believe that the offender required the degree of security provided there. If, at a later stage, the patient needs to go to the state hospital, the doctors can arrange it and the patient would have the right of appeal. So, although we welcome the fact that the Government have considered the Reed committee recommendations for England and Wales, we think the matter has been handled inappropriately and that hospital order directions should not include a punitive element.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister a brief question relating to amendment No. 92. Do the Government envisage that patients subject to a hospital direction will be in wards where every other patient is there for the same purpose or will they share a ward with patients who have been sent there in normal circumstances? The reason I ask is because it would be understandable if doctors concentrated their efforts on patients who were free to go home when they were cured. Consequently, a person sent to hospital as the result of a hospital direction may receive less medical attention because doctors may feel more motivated to work with patients who will be sent home when they are cured rather than with those who will be sent back to prison when they are considered mentally fit. Perhaps the Minister will address that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with hospital directions and people going into hospital, but will my right hon. Friend the Minister tell
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
the Committee how people can be transferred out of hospital once they have been directed into one. I ask that because there is a very large psychiatric hospital in my constituency, to which people are frequently referred. They naturally write to me when they feel that they have been there for too long—or when they feel that they should not be there at all—and ask me to assist them in being released from the hospital back into the community. Will the Bill introduce any changes to the appeal system, either to the mental health commissioners or to the hospital doctors, and what steps can a person detained by court order in a hospital take? Has he any rights of appeal and to whom should he appeal if he feels that he is much better than the original court order suggested? Will the Minister say a few words about the steps that prisoners can take to have their cases reviewed after a certain period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. First, I must make it clear that clinical decisions are very much matters for the doctor or consultant, and medical officers at the hospital decide whether the patient no longer needs to be detained. The doctor is employed at the hospital where the offender is detained and he or she is authorised by the management of that hospital to act as the doctor responsible for the patient. It is essential that when doctors make decisions they take into account the medical needs of the patient before deciding where the patient will go—home, prison, hostel or anywhere else. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked about sharing. I have visited Carstairs twice—other hon. Members have visited it only once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not worked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene, I shall give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Carstairs is working—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is missing the joke.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a joke, I see. Being subject to a mental hospital order is not a joke for those concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The patients I saw a year ago had separate rooms. Although there were security measures—many had committed homicide—they had more privacy and much improved environmental surroundings which made a considerable difference. All patients at Carstairs share, according to their medical needs and treatment, the general facilities. I must tell my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) that I shall describe in detail the possibilities of review when we reach the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the amendments have considerable merit. The purpose of our proceedings is to improve the Bill. I welcome the fact that some of the amendments do that. Having considered them in detail, I am happy to accept in principle amendments Nos. 93, 100, 101 and 102, but not amendments Nos. 92, 97, 98 and 103—that is a 50 per cent. success rate. My right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries will be interested to know that transfers
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
out of hospital for those with a hospital direction will be the same for those under a transfer direction from prison. At the end of the sentence, they will return to the community. If they recover before then, they will go to prison. It depends on the original disposal of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not dwell on those amendments that I accept in principle other than to say that amendment No. 100 sensibly adds an officer of a hospital to which a person is going to the list of those who may convey him without need of specific authority. Amendments Nos. 93, 101 and 102 reduce the maximum period during which a person may be in transit from court to hospital from 28 to seven days, which should be quite sufficient time to get someone from a court at one end of Scotland to a hospital at the other, even during the worst winter weather. We are glad to accept the principle of those amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the purpose behind amendment No. 92, but in my view it would go too far. No hospital could be as categorical as to say that it "will". The most it could say is that it "would". Also,—the word "will" would allow for no emergencies or give room for manoeuvre. The word "can" represents an appropriate commitment to something that may happen in the future, if indeed the court decides to make a hospital direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 97 and 98 would reduce the present options as to where a person may be held during that short period of transit from court to hospital, to an impractical single one—a hospital. A range of options is necessary on practical grounds. When a court sits in, for example, Lerwick or Lochmaddy, it may not be possible to get the person that day to an appropriately secure hospital. That is why we must retain the other options as, indeed, we did in the 1995 Act in respect of persons being transferred from court to hospital under a hospital order or an interim hospital order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having accepted in principle the amendments that reduce the maximum time which a person will spend getting from court to hospital, that would surely rule out the appropriateness of amendment No. 103. If an emergency arose before an offender was taken to the specified hospital—which will now have to happen in seven days or less—which warranted the Secretary of State directing that the person be detained in a different hospital, there would be insufficient time for all the procedures envisaged in amendment No. 103 to be completed. Doing so could take days or weeks, and a situation might arise in a hospital, or a person's illness might worsen. The emergency procedure must work quickly and effectively. A person affected by an emergency redirection, if I may call it that, would have all the proper rights of appeal against, for example, the imposition of the hospital direction itself or detention in a state hospital. That point was raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 would require my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to prepare a separate code of practice about the needs of mentally disordered offenders. Under the 1984 Act, the Secretary of State is required to prepare and, from time to time, to revise a code of practice dealing with the detention of patients in hospital, their discharge from hospital and the medical treatment of patients suffering from a mental disorder. The present code of practice already covers mentally
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
disordered offenders and, I believe, it does so rightly. It is helpful to have one document giving the relevant information about the various aspects of mental health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to inform the Committee that we are about to revise the existing code of practice. That will take account of recent changes including, for example, new provisions relating to community care orders that were introduced in the Mental Health (Patients in the Community) Act 1995. More relevantly, it will, I hope, cover the future code of practice relating to mentally disordered offenders—which, with the House's approval, will be introduced in the Bill. The new code of practice will be up to date and comprehensive. It will reflect the latest legislation and good practice and it will be the subject of wide consultation before it is laid before Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that members of the Committee agree that the new clause's objective is already covered by current practice. As I said, I have in principle accepted four amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister accepted those amendments. We had many discussions with the Scottish Association for Mental Health and the Law Society of Scotland about the amendments' implications. The Minister's acceptance that hospitals should admit a patient for seven days is a great step forward. In addition, local authorities and social work departments will be pleased that they will not be required to transport mentally ill patients to hospital. They felt that that undermined their traditional role, and I am sure they will be pleased that the Government accepted the principle of the amendments.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 10, line 39, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) The patient shall have the right at any time after the making of the hospital direction to appeal to the Secretary of State or the Mental Welfare Commission against his detention in a State hospital and the Secretary of State or the Mental Welfare Commission as the case may be shall order his discharge unless they are satisfied as to the matters specified in subsection (4) above.".</p></blockquote>
This simple amendment will give a patient on a hospital direction the right to appeal to either the Secretary of State or the Mental Welfare Commission, which the Minister mentioned earlier—it is a statutory watchdog for people suffering from mental disorders. That appeal would be against detention in a state hospital. If a patient can be provided with the security that he needs in another hospital, he should not be kept in a state hospital. If he is, he should have the right to a review. Detention is not appropriate if the patient does not need the degree of security that is provided. Some patients may be held in a state hospital for longer than is necessary because there are no suitable facilities available in the community. Patients should not be transferred under hospital directions in that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's desire to ensure that we strike the necessary balance between punishment and a patient's welfare. The amendment is, however, unnecessary and
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
undesirable, as I shall explain. It also returns us to the subject that was raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Restricted patients who are subject to restriction directions already have a right of appeal to the sheriff under sections 63 and 65 of the 1984 Act against their continuing detention in a state hospital or another hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 extends those provisions to patients subject to hospital directions, putting them in precisely the same position as patients subject to restriction directions. Where, in such cases, the sheriff notifies my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that the patient would, if subject to a restriction order, be entitled to be absolutely discharged, the Secretary of State must, by warrant, direct the person's transfer to prison to resume his prison sentence. On the other hand, where the sheriff notifies my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that the patient would be entitled to conditional discharge, the Secretary of State may either direct the patient's return to prison or decide that the patient should continue to be detained in a suitable hospital. Therefore, the present statutory framework encompasses an appeal mechanism and safeguards to ensure that full regard is paid to the patient's welfare on the one hand and public protection considerations on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) aims to introduce an additional appeal to the Mental Welfare Commission or the Secretary of State for hospital direction patients, but that would place them in a more favourable position than other restricted patients. At present, restricted patients—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the Minister's official please take herself outside the Room? I will not have people moving about the Committee as if they own it. This is a Committee of the House and the Minister must control the people for whom he is responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, at present, restricted patients have no statutory right of appeal to the Mental Welfare Commission, but I can assure the hon. Member for Dumbarton that the commission, in the course of carrying out its protective functions in relation to mentally ill patients, could recommend to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that it is no longer appropriate for a specific patient to be detained in hospital. That provision will also apply to patients subject to hospital directions and my right hon. Friend would give close consideration to such a recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, such patients, in common with other restricted patients, will be subject to regular review, a further matter considered desirable by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. If, at any point, it is considered that continued detention in the state hospital or another hospital is no longer appropriate, transfer to prison to resume sentence will be arranged. However, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries recognised, the state hospital is specified on an order only when the court is satisfied on the evidence of the medical practitioners that because of the patient's dangerous, violent or criminal propensities, he requires treatment in conditions of special security and cannot be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
suitably cared for in another hospital. That consideration would be borne in mind by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State when he reviewed a patient's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, there is already provision for restricted patients to appeal to the sheriff, and the provision will be extended to patients subject to a hospital direction. There is no case for adding to the appeal provisions in the case of the latter. In the light of those comments, I hope that the hon. Member for Dumbarton will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister assure us that the provisions will be fully funded by the Government—that extra places will be made available and extra psychiatrists trained? Can he give us an idea of the estimated cost and of how much new money will be set aside for the treatments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any information on cost is given in the preamble to the Bill under "Financial effects of the Bill" on pages vii and viii. The necessary resources must be provided to ensure that the job is done properly. We would not dream of introducing new provisions without making certain that the necessary funding accompanied them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read about the financial effects, but, specifically, how many new psychiatrists will be trained and what discussions are being held with the faculty to ensure that enough people are available? I understand that there is a shortage of specialist consultants throughout the health service at present. I have questioned the Minister about the issue on the Floor of the House and discovered that the planning for new consultants in many specialties is poor. We have ended up with a massive deficiency. What numbers are we discussing? What about the training period? Does the Minister really believe that enough specialists will be available in time to cope with the new orders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter is receiving close attention. I cannot provide exact numbers because we do not know about the courts' disposals. We do not know exactly how many people will be sent to hospital and how many to prison. That will depend on their state of mind, their condition and the circumstances of their offences. We must employ the necessary amount of consultants. The hon. Gentleman is right that there are shortages in certain sectors of the health service, but the number of consultants overall has increased substantially. We are giving the sector priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is in order to continue to raise questions through you, Mr. Martin, rather than making a full-blown speech, but it seems that the Minister does not have the answers. I would be concerned if we passed a Bill with worrying implications for the national health service. There is already a break-down in care in the community, where some people with serious mental illnesses seem not to be properly trailed or clinically supported. We spoke about the slashing of a minister during a previous
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
debate. There have been many other incidents of schizophrenics living in the community who cease to take their medicines, which leads to abhorrent and antisocial behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister seriously discussed the issue with the faculty of psychiatric medicine? Have the deans of the faculty been in discussion with the Scottish Office? Before the Bill was drafted, did the Minister or officials at the Scottish Office meet with the deans in Scotland or elsewhere to discuss the implications of the Bill? I suspect that the Bill was drafted in a vacuum without any consultation with the medical profession and without any consideration of its possible impact on the psychiatric needs of the rest of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did anyone consider whether the deans of the faculty were training enough people to cope with the Bill's implications? The Bill could be a serious imposition. The Minister claimed that it would deal with people who have an "acceptable" tinge of mental illness which leads to certain behaviour. The Minister made a blanket rejection of my amendment, saying that he and his team had covered the necessary issues relating to mentally disordered criminals. But, if he has not discussed the issue with those who will have to provide the care and attention, especially psychiatrists, I suggest that the measure will be poorly provisioned and resourced and is likely to be a disaster—unless, of course, the Bill is just a sham and the Government hope that there will not be many disposals and that people will not receive the medical treatment that the Bill considers them to need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the psychiatric profession is a move away from people in a clinical environment—the profession is more concerned with care in the community. Worries have been expressed that many well-trained psychiatric clinical nurses are entering other sectors of the medical profession because there are no longer permanent, stable jobs for them as patients are moved out into the community. I wonder whether there have been any discussions about that and, if there have, how many, with whom and what was the outcome?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend knows that, for some time in Glasgow, concerns have been raised about the lack of community psychiatric nurses. That being the case, it is all the more likely that some people's mental state may become so disturbed that they commit crimes that could have been avoided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that. My understanding of the problem in central Scotland is that people have been sent out into the community by Central Scotland health care trust and the Royal Scottish National hospital. When I met representatives of those institutions, they said that they did not have sufficient capital to allow them to build specific places with nursing staff, to which people could be sent. Instead, people are being sent out into the community, thereby diminishing Central Scotland health care trust's need for psychiatric nurses, who are leaving and going to other areas of the nursing profession because they need a job and a permanent income to enable them to look after their families. So the clause will place a burden on that section of the medical profession and on the nursing profession—a burden that I think they might be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
glad to take on, but they may not be there to do so. Has this been discussed and what facts does the Minister have to present to the Committee about the conclusions of those discussions? I am worried that no preparation has been made in terms of asking for resources for the profession that will take on the burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), the Minister directed the Committee to page VIII of the financial memorandum to the Bill, which refers to the financial implications of clause 5. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The additional costs … are expected to be negligible, reflecting the small number of cases in which the imposition of such a direction will be appropriate"—</p></blockquote>
Those are the Government's own words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the probability that in virtually all these cases the court would otherwise have imposed a hospital order, requiring detention in hospital."</p></blockquote>
That part of the Bill must be understood within the context of the Government's purpose in introducing that additional disposal for the courts. In the White Paper, the Government explained that, at present, the courts have the option of two extremes; they can either imprison the offender or they can impose a hospital order. That did not satisfy the Government, so they introduced the additional disposal of the hospital direction, which combines hospital and prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government's intention was to prevent the mentally ill going straight to prison, we would expect additional numbers of people to be sent to hospital. But, we can see the real purpose of clause 5 from the explanation of its financial implications. The Government are not interested in preventing the mentally ill from being sent to prison—they are happy for that to continue. They are concerned that some people are not being sent to prison but are being sent to hospital under hospital orders. That is why the Government say that this additional order will not cost much. They want people who are currently sent by the courts to hospitals to be sent to hospitals for a short time only and then to be imprisoned thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its discussion of the different disposals available to the courts, and of hospital orders in particular, one sentence in the White Paper sticks out like a sore thumb. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it will remain the appropriate disposal for convicted offenders with a genuine and enduring mental illness."</p></blockquote>
The implication is that the Government believe that those who are sent by the courts to hospital are not genuinely mentally ill. The Government think that they are faking it. They probably watched Jack Nicholson in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and think that it is always like that, but of course it is not because that is a story—well, it may be true in America. They should not imply that every offender sent to hospital is Jack Nicholson and is faking illness. The courts base their decisions to send people to hospital on psychiatric guidance. Those people are mentally ill. What worries me is how such people are expected to recover in hospital if they know that when they have recovered they will be sent back to prison while every other patient will be discharged back into the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that people who are sent to prison may become Jack Nicholson because the only other option is to return to Bahlinnie?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. It is a serious problem that those offenders who recover from mental illness and regain their reason quickly realise—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment deals with appeals. It would be more appropriate for the hon. Gentleman to make his speech in the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your guidance, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not often that my guidance is accepted—that comes as a surprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reply briefly to hon. Members? The number of hospital directions is about a dozen a year. We have discussed arrangements with the state hospital and other hospitals. We cannot say exactly how many cases there will be because it will depend on how many incidences occur in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consulted through the White Paper "Crime and Punishment". All relevant interests were given an opportunity to comment on the proposals. Of the 26 responses to chapter 13 on mentally disordered offenders and a new power of disposal for the courts, only two opposed our plans. All others agreed in principle or were neutral. Under present procedures, the court has to choose between two extremes—a hospital order with or without a restriction order, which is a mental health disposal, or a sentence of imprisonment, which has no mental health element but leaves it to the Secretary of State to transfer the prisoner to hospital if he is unwell. The case was put for there to be elements of custody and hospital treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said that a hospital direction may not benefit a person if he is returned to prison when he is discharged. One of the essential factors that we are considering is the protection of the community. If a person has killed a young child—I regret that there have been such cases in Scotland—the protection of the community is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is genuinely concerned about the protection of the community he should realise that a person sent to the state hospital at Carstairs under a hospital direction is apart from the community, which remains safe while he is there. That is not the issue. The issue is whether he should be in hospital or spend part of his sentence in prison. If he is mentally ill, he should be in hospital, not prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give an example to the hon. Gentleman? If someone is a psychopath, his condition may not be treatable in a mental hospital, but he is still a danger to the community. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point that a transfer from hospital to prison may have an adverse effect on a person's mental health. That must be taken into account by prison doctors who, I have no doubt, will do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper said that if doctors considered offenders still to be detainable under mental health
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
legislation, the hospital direction would cease and they would be detained as if a hospital order had been imposed, but without a restriction order. If the patient were released, leave of absence conditions might be attached with the possibility of recall to hospital. I should point out to the hon. Member for Falkirk, East that the White Paper made it clear that the Government would welcome views on its proposals for new hospital directions. We have consulted and we received those 26 responses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that a hospital was not the most appropriate place to deal with a psychopath. But neither is prison. What is the most appropriate place? Surely if a psychopath is sent to Bahlinnie—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee must restrict itself to discussing amendment No. 95, which deals with the right to appeal against a hospital direction. Whether the use of another institution is appropriate is not relevant. The amendment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The patient shall have the right at any time after the making of the hospital direction to appeal to the Secretary of State or the Mental Welfare Commission against this detention in a State hospital".</p></blockquote>
We must restrict ourselves to discussing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I mentioned earlier, patients already have the right of appeal to the sheriff, which is appropriate. Patients, like other restricted patients, will be subject to regular review and, if continued attention is no longer appropriate, transfer to prison to resume sentence will be arranged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make some general comments about what the Minister said about psychopaths. The problem is that those in the Scottish Association for Mental Health, Enable and others do not consider prison to be the most appropriate place. If a court finds an individual guilty and considers him to be mentally ill, to add a punitive element to a sentence when psychiatrists have already found that person not to be in full possession of his faculties, seems illogical and to go against professional medical advice. Paragraph 13.2 of the White Paper refers to a convicted offender having a "genuine and enduring" mental illness. We need to have a greater understanding of what that means and of the Government's reasoning behind that phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are happy that the Government have considered the proposals of the Reed committee—the 1994 Home Office and Department of Health working party chaired by Dr. John Reed. There are significant differences between the Reed committee proposals and those in the White Paper and the Bill. The Reed recommendations related only to those suffering from "psychopathic disorder"—a kind of mental disorder that is defined in the English Mental Health Act 1983, but not in the Scottish legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Reed recommendations were based on concerns about the treatability of a psychopathic disorder. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
is currently little consensus on what constitutes that disorder and how—and whether—it can be treated. The medical profession has genuine concerns about how to treat that disorder. Those concerns put into stark reality the Minister's remarks that someone suffering from a psychopathic disorder can be put into prison. That disorder would certainly not be assisted by an individual being transferred to Bahlinnie or another prison in Scotland. There is no one in those prisons to help such offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A hospital order is predicated on the assumption that the offender is ill, in need of treatment and, ultimately, may be cured—and hospitals may be unwilling to accept psychopathically disordered patients if it seems unlikely that treatment will lead to a safe discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rationale behind the White Paper proposals—the need to combine a punitive element with a hospital order—must be questioned. It seems paradoxical and I would like the Minister to tell us why the Government thought it was necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following your advice, Mr. Martin, I am contributing to the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal for mentally disordered offenders takes up a whole chapter in the White Paper. The Minister told us that the consultation exercise attracted more than 20 responses—two of which opposed the proposal. Which two bodies opposed the proposal, which takes up six clauses in the Bill? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hear the bagpipes stirring and tears spring to my eyes as I stand here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is choked for words he can always sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the hon. Gentleman who deserves to be choked for his words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all the work that went into the proposals, the Minister told the Committee that only about 12 people a year are given a hospital order by a court. Most of those cases, I suspect, are genuine—the people are genuinely mentally ill and should be given hospital orders to send them directly to hospital. We have gone through a lot of bother over this matter—there is a huge chapter about it in the White Paper, there was a big consultation exercise, and six clauses in the Bill relate to it. Now it appears that the measure will merely deal with the one or two people a year who the Minister thinks are not genuinely mentally ill. His arguments do not stand up to scrutiny, and he should take his clauses away and leave the courts with the two disposals that they have at present: hospital disposal and imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts send far too many people suffering from mental illness to prison rather than to hospital. If the courts discharged them to hospital, more beds in psychiatric hospitals across the country would be needed. The new female judge who has just been appointed made a speech this week. She knows about the problem—she works in the Scottish courts—and she is worried that psychiatric hospitals do not have enough beds to deal with people who are in the community but who should be in hospital. I suspect that the courts know that those people should be in hospital but occasionally send people to prison because they know that there are not enough beds in the hospital system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
We should remember that, for the past few years, the Government have aimed to close down 8,000 long-stay beds in psychiatric hospitals in Scotland. Every member of the Committee knows from constituency experience that wards and beds in psychiatric hospitals are being closed all the time. Care in the community—which is insufficiently funded anyway—is funded by closing wards in long-term hospitals and transferring that saving to social work departments, which never get enough money. The Government's policy is to oppose sending people to hospital. How they could now introduce an additional disposal saying that no one should be sent to hospitals is beyond me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither the Minister's arguments nor the clauses make sense. The courts should decide whether people are mentally ill or not and then deal with them appropriately. If they are mentally ill they should be in hospital. The courts should not give out a hybrid sentence involving hospital and gaol. Either people are mentally ill or they are not: that should be the end of the story. People who are mentally ill should not be held culpable for their actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Opposition Members often shout and bounce about on the media discussing people who have been released from hospital.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's comments were somewhat in conflict with very responsible organisations such as Enable and the Scottish Association for Mental Health which addressed the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs yesterday. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman studies their words. They accept that beds in mental institutions—as they were previously known—should be closed, because that is a natural progression. But we must maintain a reasonable level of provision as a fall back for those who may require such facilities, so there must always be an excess of beds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the sentencing process there may be instances of people feigning mental illness so as to be treated lightly. If such offenders are not treated in the same way as everyone else for the crimes that they have committed, it may become the practice for the defence to try to demonstrate that someone has a mental illness, thereby avoiding a life sentence. That would bring the Bill into disrepute. My right hon. Friend got the provision absolutely right and I ask him to stick with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the sort of speech that brings Parliament into disrepute. No member of the Committee and probably no one in the House—there are more than 600 Members—wants to take any risks with the safety of the community. No one is urging that someone who is dangerous and cannot be trusted outside a secure place should be released to murder people and to be a danger to the community. We are discussing the best way of dealing with people who have committed a serious offence such as murder and who are suffering from a curable psychiatric illness or an untreatable condition, or who, because they committed murder from motives that, however wicked, appeared to them to be rational, were found by the court to be unfit to plead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us wants to take risks with public safety, but my hon. Friends have raised issues concerning the closure of beds in long-term psychiatric hospitals—a subject that is relevant to the debate. Some time ago, when care in the community was first debated in the House, the Minister gave a guarantee that beds would not be closed if places were not available in the community. The Government said that they would not take risks with the community or with people's mental health. Yet we know from widespread evidence throughout Scotland that people have been sent out of psychiatric hospitals into the community without receiving the care that they need. There is a dearth of psychiatric community nurses; when people are allowed to leave hospital and are expected to continue medication, they often do not receive the necessary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
supervision. It can be difficult for someone to persist with the medication necessary to keep him in a balanced mental state, but there is no back-up in the community to ensure that he does so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anyone is taking risks with public safety, it is the Government, who allow people to leave long-term psychiatric care, but do not provide them with the necessary care in the community to ensure that their mental state does not endanger public safety. That is why there have been appalling incidents of people throwing themselves into a lion's cage or committing murder for no reason.

It is very difficult to feign mental illness. Anyone doing so must convince two experienced doctors, who have studied the subject for several years and are not likely to be taken in. I must ask the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) what type of mental state a person would have to be in to imagine that it would be a good idea to be incarcerated in a mental hospital rather than a prison. That is hardly getting off lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, a psychopath might be completely untreatable, but the fact remains, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, that a hospital would be the best place for such a person. Even if he is untreatable, he would at least be in a place where people knew how to manage him better than they would in a prison. Mentally ill people are being sent to prison, where their mental state worsens, because no one there has any notion of how to manage the case properly. They are a continuing danger to themselves and to other prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give a reasoned reply—something that has so far been missing from the comments of the hon. Member for Ayr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Through the Minister's answers, the Government have revealed that the measure represents yet another piece of posturing. On hearing about the contents of the Bill, people thought that life would mean life and that a great many people who showed signs of mental illness would be sent for treatment. People are generally of the opinion that many offenders are sent to prison although they require treatment and come out as worse criminals as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of my earlier catch-all amendment was to provide treatment as part of the criminal disposals for more people whose psychiatric and psychological state makes them unfit to mix with the public. The Government claimed that they would introduce clauses to deal with the issue later, but the Minister revealed that possibly a dozen people in a year might be disposed of in that way. Of all the thousands of prisoners who commit such offences—sometimes in a succession of incidents—a dozen a year might go to prison. That makes a sham of the Government's posture on Second Reading and of their pretences in the White Paper. The public in Scotland have a right to think that they have been conned once again by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to consider the reality of prison for people who are physically ill and at risk of harming themselves. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton and I examined the cases of a number of people who committed suicide in prison, having been given medical
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
care and treatment in the prison system before being transferred to a wholly custodial situation. In such cases, the medical profession did not transfer their records to the custodial section and the prisoners were left unsupervised, enabling them to commit suicide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of suicides in Scottish prisons has increased substantially in the past couple of years, as the Minister knows. The number has almost doubled, excluding what happened in Cornton Vale. The Minister and the prison system have had to admit time and again that there was a break-down in communication between the medical profession and the custodial section of the prison. There was a case in my constituency of a gentleman from Grangemouth who committed suicide in exactly those conditions—he had been under care because he had attempted to commit suicide while on remand and was then sent to Barlinnie where he went into the custodial process. His records were transferred from the medical profession at the remand centre to the medical profession at Barlinnie, but were not transferred to the custodial section. Therefore, my constituent was not put under a supervisory regime and he committed suicide in Barlinnie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of times that that has happened is quite frightening. People who have been put into the new disposal for psychiatric treatment are then returned to the prison system where, as my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill said, the staff are not equipped to cope. They do not know how to care for people who are likely to be psychiatrically disturbed. The problem has been underlined by about 17 cases of suicide in Scottish prisons in the past year due to the inability of the custodial section of the criminal disposals to deal with mentally unstable people. If they are considered to be mentally disordered, which has led to their criminal intent and behaviour, how much more stupid is it to provide a treatment regime, then dump them back into the custodial regime? It does not make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is a con and a silly idea. The Government want to be seen to be punishing people. The want to be seen to be preventing further long-term damage to society, which worries us all, and to individuals by preventing people from being criminals. The Government think that it is a matter of temporarily stabilising people before sticking them back in prison where they are dealt with as prisoners. That does not work for those who are mentally unstable and commit suicide, and it will not work for those who are mentally disordered and in need of incarceration and treatment as a response to their criminal behaviour. I should like to know the response of the dean of the Faculty of Advocates for psychiatric medicine to the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Faculty of Advocates agreed, as did the Law Society, the Lord Justice-General and the Lord Justice-Clerk. The Association of Directors of Social Work agreed in principle. The Scottish Police Federation, the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents and the Association of Chief Police Officers also agreed. Many councils—Glasgow, incidentally, was neutral—Victim Support Scotland and, significantly, Enable—formerly called the Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped—agreed. Although the proposal could
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
apply to people with learning disabilities, Enable did not think that there was a need for a hospital direction for them. It believed that the new disposal should apply only to mental illness, not to mental disorder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The representations overall were very much in favour. South Lanarkshire council and Aberdeenshire council agreed. The Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical and Computer Staff, which is involved with the resettlement of offenders when they leave prison, agreed, as did the Scottish Grocers Federation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify what he means by agreed? Is he saying that all those organisations, including the Scottish Association for Mental Health and Enable agree with the hybrid order and its punitive element? That is not the information we are receiving from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some organisations agreed. Some—such as the Scottish National party—agreed in principle. We received many responses, which is significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect to the Scottish National party or any other political party, we want to know what organisations with experience of mental impairment have to say, and specifically whether they approve of the provisions in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Enable agreed in principle. It thought that there was a need to set out the criteria for including the hospital direction in legislation and that work was needed on the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Needs further work on details!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hospital will always be the proper location for a patient who is considered by medical practitioners to be mentally ill and in need of hospital care. A hospital direction would be appropriate if a person was not ill at the commission of the offence, was found guilty—that is, criminally responsible—but at the time of sentencing was ill and in need of hospital treatment. In such circumstances, a disposal should not depend entirely on the chance of a person being ill at the time of sentencing. A prison sentence may be appropriate with an initial period of hospital treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton asked about an enduring mental illness. If it is a short one, or likely to be a short one, the appropriate option may be an interim hospital order, which we are increasing from six to 12 months, for swift treatment and proper diagnosis. We hope that that will be followed by recovery and return to court for final sentencing. The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked about faking mental illness. He may be surprised to know that, in recent years, there has been at least one case in which an accused person was convicted of defeating the aims of justice by successfully faking mental illness. I cannot give the Committee further details of that case but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and send him a copy of the indictment. I thought it would be useful for him to know
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
that the precedent exists. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I will let hon. Members have copies of the indictment, but it will take a few hours for me to lay my hands on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions relating to psychopaths cannot depend entirely on treatment considerations if an individual has committed very serious offences or, for example, more than one killing. I believe that we have fully discussed the clause, which allows greater flexibility than currently exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During my brief speech, I asked the Minister to tell us which two organisations opposed the Bill. He has told us who supported the Bill but not who opposed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is the Edinburgh Bar Association, which said that more work needed to be done before the proposals could be implemented, and the Mental Welfare Commission, which wanted them restricted to those with a personality disorder. However, I believe that that would erode the concept of diminished responsibility. Someone may commit a killing and be found guilty of culpable homicide as a result of diminished responsibility but, at the time of the act, the offender may have had criminal intention, which merits a prison sentence, but may also need hospital treatment, at least for a time. We believe that greater flexibility should be given to the courts rather than their having to choose between hospital treatment or a prison sentence, depending on the circumstances. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I can tell the hon. Member for Ayr that it was organisations such as Enable and the Scottish Association for Mental Health, with which we have had discussions, that wanted the amendments to be tabled in order to obtain further clarification. We are all at one in wanting to protect the public and ensure that those who have a mental illness are properly treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the organisations that were in favour of the proposals. The Association of Directors of Social Work wrote to us and gave the White Paper a very cautious welcome but wanted to know more details. Now that we have heard the details, we still believe that certain questions arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanne Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that is likely to be true of virtually all the organisations that initially responded and whose response was simply to the principle of the contents of the White Paper? In every case, once the detail became clear, they were bound to be concerned about what was intended in practice. That is certainly true of the SNP and I suspect it is true of all the organisations mentioned by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that, on mature reflection, the SNP has reached the same decision as we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we need is a proper review of mental health but we still do not have that. To proceed with new measures for mentally disordered offenders in the absence of a proper review of their needs does not do justice to the whole issue.

Mention was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East of the epidemic in suicides at Cornton Vale and elsewhere. That comes within the provisions of the clause, and it would be appropriate for the Minister to deal with that issue. Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons published a report on Cornton Vale and I hope to visit that prison in the next few weeks—I have already spoken to the Scottish prison service and obtained permission for that visit—but we have not finished with that issue at Cornton Vale. Cornton Vale is just one example of the problem. Without an urgent review, the Government do a disservice to mentally disordered offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has been made of a couple of cases. I remember the tragic deaths of Constable Lewis Fulton and a GP in Ayrshire, who were both killed by a disturbed patient. The new disposal would not have helped in either case, nor would it have assisted the considerable number of mentally disordered people who come into contact with the police and courts because they do not receive the care and support they need from social work and health services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister take our comments seriously in the spirit in which they are given and, before Report, reexamine the measures so that we have unanimity on the issue and can go forward on Report with measures that have the full support of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make yet another speech, Mr. Martin, but when the Minister responds will he undertake to give us information about that one case he knows about of someone who faked mental illness? How long after his court appearance was he found out?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the views of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, which has written to the Government strongly advising against the hybrid orders in the absence of a full review of services. I should like the Minister to comment on that advice in his winding-up remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that, before the Bill is enacted, the Committee can hear from the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland and any other bodies with relevant experience to find out precisely their views on clause 5. Is there any possibility that the Minister might, in the light of their evidence, reconsider the clause's provisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the general responses that have been given, the representations in favour are strong and I shall justify quickly the case for that specific course of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first instance, if a mentally disordered person is charged, the court may consider that his mental condition is such that he cannot rationally plead or
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
instruct his defence. In that case, the court will find that the accused is unfit to stand trial. That will probably rule out many accused who are suffering from acute mental illness or significant mental handicap. In those cases, there will be no conviction and the court will not be able to make a hospital direction. That means that someone who is found to be insane will be in a different category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In cases where a mentally disordered person does stand trial, the court may acquit the person on ground of insanity if it concludes that the person was so ill at the time of commission of the offence that he cannot be held criminally responsible for what he did. Again, in such a case there will be no conviction and consequently no question of the court making a hospital direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be cases, however, where a person's mental condition is such that he was well enough to stand trial and to be held criminally responsible but none the less unwell enough to be the sort of person who should be treated in a hospital rather than sent immediately to prison. In such a case, the new provision will enable the court to make a hospital direction by virtue of which the person will be sent directly to an appropriate hospital for appropriate treatment. If, following that treatment, but during the currency of the sentence of imprisonment, the person regains his mental health he will then be transferred to prison for the remainder of the period of the sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a considerable number of people in the state hospital at Carstairs for the time being but who will return to prison once they have recovered. When they have recovered is a matter for clinical decision and not for me. I hope that that explanation makes the purpose of clauses 5 and 6 clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that useful information about the people in Carstairs. How many people have returned to prison, having been in Carstairs as mentally ill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman asks a parliamentary question, we shall do our best to sort out the statistics and give him the necessary information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following my explanation I hope that hon. Members will appreciate that the courts will have a flexibility that they do not have at present and that that is generally welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister specifically whether the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland—the statutory watchdog—has written to the Government strongly advising against the introduction of hospital directions for patients. I would like an answer from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland was one of the two bodies that are opposed. It welcomed extension of the hospital order from six to 12 months, but it believes that a hybrid order covering the whole area of mental disorder is undesirable on the grounds that it confuses issues of treatment and punishment and threatens to erode concepts of diminished or absent responsibility for actions. The provision introduces
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
flexibility when someone has committed a serious crime such as homicide and the court believes that the offender should serve a long period in prison but that he is sufficiently unwell to merit hospital treatment for a period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not often try to kid us, but he tried to do so this morning. It is now on the record that the statutory watchdog said that hospital directions are undesirable. They are undesirable because a proper review of services for mentally disordered people has not been undertaken. We shall have more Cornton Vales and more suicides elsewhere if we do not tackle the problem effectively. There have been five suicides at Cornton Vale in 18 months. Why do we stand out in national and international statistics?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the summer I visited a number of gaols in the Virginia and Washington areas of America. At every gaol I visited I asked about the number of suicides but there was none because proper arrangements were in place. There are young women in Cornton Vale and elsewhere who should not be there. The Government have said that they will consider the problem of fine default, bail hostels and drug programmes, but nothing has happened to date. We face a serious situation and the Minister must examine it before the Bill returns to the House so that we can tell the Scottish public, professionals and the grieving parents of those in Cornton Vale that we recognise the tragic circumstances that led to those deaths and will do something about them. If the Minister takes that course of action, he will have the full support of the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 6</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EFFECT OF HOSPITAL DIRECTION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister some questions about the clause. New section 62A to the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 states in paragraph (1) (a):
	<br><blockquote><p>"a constable, a mental health officer or other person … directed … by the court to convey the person … to the hospital".</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister accept that the most appropriate person would be a member of staff of the hospital rather than a constable and that it would be easy to amend the Bill to take account of that. It may be more appropriate for someone who is accustomed to taking charge of mentally ill people to carry out that task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (2) refers to what should happen if the hospital which is first directed to receive a patient cannot do so. It states that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"may give a direction under this subsection for the admission of that person to such other hospital as appears to be appropriate in lieu"</p></blockquote>
of the first hospital. Would the receiving hospital know in advance that the patient was being sent to it under care? This is not a trivial point. Hospitals have known people to turn up on their doorsteps because there was nowhere else for them to go—they have already tried
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
several other hospitals. If a person was going to hospital B instead of hospital A and hospital B knew that they would definitely arrive, in what circumstances would it be certain that hospital B would be able to admit the patient? Such certainty would avoid prisoners in a difficult mental state being shunted from one hospital to another to find out which will take them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further question arises from subsection (3) of new section 62A. Given the stress on bed places, is it possible that another patient who ought to be taken in could be deferred because of the direction that another person must be taken in? I understand that it is common for people who know that they suffer from mental illness and who live in the community to realise that their mental state is deteriorating and to refer themselves back to hospital. They are quite likely to telephone the hospital and say, "I want to come back in." The hospital might have to turn them away because it has a direction that it must take in someone else because of events in court. How would the hospital system cope with the possibility that a mentally ill person who knew that he was in a dangerous condition and needed to be back in hospital might be told, "Well, you can't come in"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 62A(4) (b) deals with the power to grant leave of absence to patients. The leave of absence would be exercisable only with the Secretary of State's consent. What are the practicalities of that? I cannot imagine that the Secretary of State will personally have to examine every application for a period of leave. I presume that, in reality, the task will be carried out by a civil servant on the Secretary of State's behalf. Would it be appropriate for hospital management to deal with any appeals? If so, on what grounds might such a request be turned down? An obvious ground would be if a person's mental state was such that he could not safely be released, but I wonder what powers would exist for the patient-cum-prisoner to appeal if he felt that he was being unfairly prevented from taking leave of absence for what might be an important reason—to attend a family funeral, for example. If leave of absence was granted, would the patient remain under guard? If someone's mental state was generally stable but it was thought that he might need the security of someone accompanying him, would that be provided for in preference to the person being left to wander around free for hours or even days? In some circumstances, it might be possible to let someone out provided that they were closely guarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister deal with those questions? We have not tabled amendments on them and there are probably sensible answers—could we hear them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause has elicited responses from various organisations. There was a debate during consideration of the previous clause about which organisations supported clauses 5 to 10. Just for the record, every member of the Committee should have received briefing notes from the Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders which make it clear that not only SACRO opposes the measures, but that other bodies do too. SACRO writes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"we would support the … Penal Affairs Consortium and the Scottish Association for Mental Health who consider that this clause would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
lead to the unnecessary and unjustified criminalisation of people who are ill."</p></blockquote>
Many organisations which represent mentally ill people in the community in Scotland take that view. It is injudicious of the Minister to try to pretend that there is widespread support for the Bill. It is clear that there is not. There is considerable anxiety about the implications of the clauses for people who suffer from mental illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked the Minister why clause 6 specifies that the person who transfers the offender from the court to the hospital should be a police officer or a social worker. I hope that that is not for financial reasons. A staff member of the hospital to which the offender is being sent should bring him in because that member of staff will be working with the offender in the period ahead. That was the advice of everyone who works with those suffering from mental illness. I would be concerned if the Government were not allowing that to happen for financial reasons. Much money and many resources need to be put into psychiatric hospitals to enable them to carry out this valuable work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other concern about the clause relates to the provision that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the order must be implemented within 28 days".</p></blockquote>
We assume that the order is imposed in court when an offender is convicted. After conviction why should 28 days pass before that person is taken to hospital? What happens in the meantime? Is the person transferred to prison? If that person must go straight from court to prison for 28 days, that is a matter for concern because the Minister said that the people involved are well enough to stand trial, plead and be sentenced but at the same time are suffering from mental illness or a mental handicap and are not well enough to go to prison. If they are not well enough to go to prison, why the 28-day lapse during which—we do not know—they may be sent there? The civil servant is shaking his head and saying that that is not the case. If it is not the case, someone should say so. We are left to use our imagination about what might happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Organisations have written to Opposition members of the Committee to suggest that 28 days is, in any case, too long and that that period should be seven days. Facilities should be available to get people into hospital within seven days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The references to leave of absence also concern me. My understanding is that people under ordinary hospital orders in psychiatric hospitals can, on the judgment of doctors, be given leave of absence for a considerable time to go back into the community and see how they get on. However, once people under those specific hospital orders are judged well enough by the doctor not to need to stay in hospital, they would be sent back to prison. Why have leave of absence if the intention is to send them back to prison as soon as they are well enough? Surely there is no chance of those offenders being entitled to any kind of leave of absence. Will the Minister explain precisely what is meant by leave of absence? Is it the kind to which any other psychiatric patient is entitled or is it a kind that refers only to those specific patients? As my hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
Maryhill has asked, would a short leave of absence to attend a funeral in the family be appropriate? The Minister must make clear the intention of these measures before the Committee allows the clause to stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond. These cases deal with serious crimes. They relate to convictions that will have been taken in solemn cases in indictment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maryhill asked whether the hospital knows when the offender is coming. The answer is certainly: the Secretary of State will let the hospital know in advance and, before giving the direction, will confirm with it that a bed is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accepted the principle of amendment No. 100 earlier. We have also accepted the principle of amendment No. 93. Appeals can be made to the sheriff and an individual who has been sentenced has the same right to appeal as a restricted patient.

The hon. Members for Maryhill and for Dundee, East asked about leave of absence. Decisions on that issue are taken administratively by the Scottish Office on the basis of medical advice and on the recommendation of the relevant hospital. Consideration will also be given to security and welfare implications. Generally, we give priority in the national health service to issues involving mental health—and we attach importance to doing so. If, as the end of the seven-day period approaches, a person has not been admitted to a hospital, the Secretary of State can use the emergency procedures specified in subsection (2) to ensure that that person gets to hospital quickly.

Clause 6 is closely linked with clause 5. It prescribes the effect of a hospital direction and makes a series of consequential amendments. As I said, I have already accepted in principle various amendments, and I hope that the Committee will accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the Minister's answers were helpful, but he has not responded to a couple of my points about the clause.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not discussing self-referring patients; we are discussing people who appear before a court charged with very serious crimes.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misunderstood my point. I know that we are not discussing self-referring patients; we are discussing someone who has committed a serious crime and who is to be sent to a psychiatric hospital. A patient might have been discharged and be living in the community, but he might wish to refer himself back into hospital. However, he might be told, "Sorry, there is no room. We have just taken in a patient whom we must accept because a court directed us to do so." That is my point. Places in psychiatric hospitals are less readily available than they used to be, and people have found it hard to be referred back into hospital. As a result of the clause, will a self-referring patient find it harder to refer himself back into hospital?

With regard to powers to grant leave of absence, can a person seeking leave of absence appeal against a decision or have advocacy on his behalf? The easiest option might be taken and all applications refused on grounds of public safety. However, it might be safe to allow a person out provided that that is done under secure conditions. The line of least resistanced is simply to refuse all applications. What safeguards will deal with that problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intervention will give the Minister time to read his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will he enlarge on his comments about leave of absence? Perhaps I am being especially thick this morning, but, as I understand it, we are dealing with hospital orders, which means that a court will specify that a person is not well enough to go to prison and must go to hospital instead, and that as soon as he recovers he will be sent to prison for the rest of his sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time spent in hospital may include treatment—a doctor might believe that leave of absence is justified and recommend that to the Secretary of State, who might say, "Okay, discharge the person into the community as part of his treatment to see whether he has properly recovered." In those circumstances, it would be bizarre to say that someone going back into the community should be regarded as a success, because he could be pulled back in at some stage to spend time in prison. It seems utterly self-defeating to have leave of absence for patients who, as soon as they recover, will be required to go back into prison. I understand leaves of absence in relation to any other patient in a psychiatric hospital—the aim of their treatment is to send them back into the community. However, that is not the case with the patients we are discussing—in their case the aim is to get them well enough to return them to prison. How does leave of absence fit in? Will prisoners get leave of absence when governors or warders see that they are getting a bit frustrated and decide that it might be in their own interests to let them go? The Minister appears to be playing with the law but has no clear idea of what he wants to do. Will he explain exactly how the leave of absence provisions will work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reply briefly. In the case of self-referring patients, any patient in need of care will always be admitted to hospital. As for leave of absence, there is no specific right of appeal but cases are dealt with sympathetically and decisions are taken administratively. Of course considerations have to be borne in mind about security implications. What sometimes happens is that a prisoner who has a death in the family or a seriously ill relative requests a leave of absence. It is right that a patient can do that and that such cases are dealt with sympathetically. If prisoners are granted leave of absence, why not patients?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be clear. The Minister is speaking about compassionate leave of absence for particular reasons relating to the family. It will not mean that other psychiatric patients get leave of absence for
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
long periods as part of their treatment. That is my point. Will it be possible for those patients to get leave of absence, or do they not have the same rights as other psychiatric patients?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think that that should be the case for a patient involved in a serious incident—such as an assault resulting in severe injury or a homicide—which goes to the High Court. Protecting the interests of the community is important, but a person whose mental health needs are being treated in hospital should have the same right to compassionate leave of absence as a prisoner in a prison and should not be disadvantaged. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman would dispute that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any private facilities for the security of offenders with mental health problems in Scotland. Do the Government propose to build such facilities? We would not want them developed without proper debate and a full review of services for offenders, which we have been requesting. We want to probe the Government to discover what they have in mind to encourage the development of private hospitals for the secure treatment of mentally ill offenders in Scotland, and why the provision is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although new models of services may be appropriate—for example, the reported new development of remand facilities for women drug abusers previously sent to Cornton Vale—we need proper debate and scrutiny of such proposals. The Minister should take the opportunity to address what is happening at Cornton Vale and possible private provision before we move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see from the notes on clauses that a 1984 Act prevents private hospitals from being used. In 1984 the same Government were in power. There must have been a reason at that time for excluding private hospitals. What has changed since then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a quick question for my right hon. Friend the Minister. Much has been said about Cornton Vale. Will he review the tragic events at Cornton Vale and say whether any of them would have been covered by the provisions in the clause which relate to those who have committed serious and vicious crimes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can explain. This is a short and simple clause to remove an anomaly in the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. At present, section 71 of that Act enables a sentenced prisoner to be transferred to a national health service hospital or a private hospital that is registered under part IV of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
Act. Section 70, however, prevents remand prisoners from being transferred to a private hospital. That seems an illogical and unduly restrictive distinction to make. Decisions on the appropriate hospital location for an individual should depend on his or her circumstances, including the level of security required, not on whether the prisoner is a remand or sentenced prisoner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before a private hospital can be registered under the 1984 Act—this is very important—it will need to comply with whatever conditions my right hon. Friend sets. They would include security requirements and appropriate levels of medical and nursing staff and standards of treatment and care. No private hospitals are registered under part IV at present; nor are any applications for registration immediately in prospect. The clause simply corrects what is perceived to be an anomaly in the 1984 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 of the Bill provides the power to allow a private hospital which fulfills the requirements needed for registration under the 1984 Act to be considered for remand prisoners should such a development occur in Scotland in future. It is a useful provision to remove an inconsistency in existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr asked what effect it will have on Cornton Vale. That answer is that it will have none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we pressed the Minister, because we now discover that although no one has applied to run such a hospital, there could be such an application and the Minister wants to allow for that possibility. We all know what happened when Group 4 was allowed to transport prisoners. We have cause to be concerned about the possibility of a private hospital succeeding in winning such a contract and then, for reasons of cost-cutting and profit-seeking, running it without the necessary care and attention and putting public safety at risk. We have seen that elsewhere in society when the profit motive has overridden the public service motive, and public safety has been put in danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are simply ironing out an anomaly, I cannot believe that it was 12 years before they noticed it. It seems to have more to do with the harbouring of right-wing attitudes by a Government who want more and more to go into the private sector, even to the point of creating a private hospital for the purpose. It occurs to me that perhaps they have at last found a use for Healthcare International on Clydebank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is not being totally forthcoming. He must have some reason for believing that a private hospital would be appropriate. Why does he want to take that aspect of health care out of the national health service and open it to the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to an illogical situation, but the clause is illogical. He is giving the courts power to send patients to a private hospital that qualifies under part IV of the 1984 Act when no such hospitals exist. He is giving the courts power to send patients to hospitals that do not exist and says that that is remedying an illogical situation. Surely is is creating an illogical situation. Why do the courts need the power if they cannot use it because there are no such private hospitals anywhere in Scotland? My hon. Friends are
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
right in saying that the only rational argument for the clause is that the Government plan to have private hospitals built around the country to look after patients who are sent there by the courts. They are already planning a private prison at Kilmarnock and one of the sleights of hand that they use in the financial memorandum to the Bill is to minimise the cost of the Bill by saying that there will be no need for a lot more prison staff in Scotland. That is not because there will be no more prisoners in Scotland, but because there will be private prisons with private warders who are not members of the Scottish prison staff at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been revealed in all their terrible glory. They are privatising institutions that look after mentally ill people. Just how low can the Government sink? It is a very short clause, but it reveals just what the Government are about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that clause 70 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984—brought in by the Government—was illogical.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, let me tell the Minister why he is wrong about that.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) sees it that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must deal with the issue of mental disorder and we need a proper review. Will the Minister explain why section 70 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 is being changed now when, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, there is no private provision? There must be a proper, comprehensive debate on that subject, and this Committee presents the best opportunity for that. So we are asking the Minister to flesh out the Government's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must repeat that it seems anomalous to have a provision in the 1984 Act that enables sentenced prisoners, but not remand prisoners, to be transferred to a private hospital. The clause merely corrects that anomaly, and hon. Members should not get excited about it because it has no application at present. We believe that the anomaly of treating sentenced prisoners differently from remand prisoners should be corrected. But, of course, a private hospital would have to be registered under the 1984 Act and would need to comply with the conditions laid down by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite apart from the conditions that would have to be fulfilled before such a hospital would be allowed to open, how often does the Minister envisage a private hospital being open to inspection and by whom?

	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that the managers of the hospital have confirmed to the court that they will admit the person to such unit".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would ensure that the court can specify a particular unit in a hospital only if the hospital confirms that it has a bed available and will take the patient. It is inappropriate for the court to specify a particular unit in a hospital direction unless it has confirmation that the patient can be admitted. For example, the court might wish the patient to go to a rehabilitation unit that it considers would be especially helpful, but if the unit is unwilling or unable to take the patient, the Secretary of State would be able to specify another hospital, which might not be as suitable, so the courts' wishes could thus be overturned. The amendment would ensure that the courts' wishes were respected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the thrust of the amendment. It is essential that, before making an order committing a person to hospital, the court is assured of the availability of a bed in conditions which match the patient's requirements. I am glad to say that, where a hospital order or direction is made under sections 57, 58 or 59A of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, the court must be satisfied that a bed will be available in the hospital concerned. Currently, it must do so within 28 days of making the order but in future—as was agreed in principle in our response to amendments Nos. 93, 101 and 102—that period will be restricted to seven days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before a court makes an order, it is clearly appropriate that it should be assured of the availability

of a suitable bed in the hospital or unit concerned—that is the current usual practice. I am glad to say that current good practice will be reinforced in future under clause 9 of the Bill, which states that one of the medical practitioners whose evidence is to be taken into account under various sections of the 1995 Act must be employed at the hospital concerned. He is uniquely placed, therefore, to give the court any assurance that it may seek.

	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have received several representations about the matter from the Law Society of Scotland. It is worried about the five-year sentencing power of the sheriff courts, and it questions the need for increased sentencing powers, especially in the light of proposed changes to the early-release provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland informed me that it supports the contentions that were made by SACRO, but it felt that the relevant increases should be restricted to four years because that is the period after which different release procedures apply to those who are currently sentenced to custody. Prisoners who serve sentences of less than four years, currently have an early release rate of 50 per cent., and the rate for those serving sentences of four years or more and who are not granted parole is 66 per cent. There would seem to be merit in using the same break point for the maximum sentences available to sheriff courts and in reducing the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
sentence from five to four years. Will the Minister comment on those issues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 11 increases the maximum period of imprisonment which certain courts can impose. The measure will provide the courts with increased flexibility in dealing with the range of cases coming before them. The current maximum periods are three years for sheriff and jury trials. In sheriff summary courts, the maximum is three months, although where second and subsequent offences inferring personal violence or dishonest appropriation of property are concerned, the courts may impose a maximum of six months. In the district court, the maximum is 60 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government make no apology for keeping the sentencing powers of the courts under review. Hon. Members may recall that the sentencing powers of the sheriff solemn court were increased in 1988 from two to three years. in 1994, we consulted again on whether there was a need to increase the sentencing powers of the courts primarily as a means of relieving pressure on those courts. It was concluded at that time that, in the absence of a system of sentencing guidelines, it would be better to concentrate instead on seeking to have more cases tried in the sheriff solemn court. But matters have changed since then. Business has increased in the High Court and the sheriff solemn courts and the number of remits for sentence from the sheriff solemn court to the High Court has increased. Crucially though, the High Court now has express statutory powers to issue sentencing guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, clause 11 provides for the maximum period of imprisonment which certain courts can impose to be increased to five years in sheriff and jury trials and six months in sheriff summary, with up to 12 months for relevant second and subsequent offences. There would be no change in the powers of the lay justices in the district court but, as at present, the powers of stipendiary magistrates who are professional judges would continue to mirror those of the sheriff summary court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed increases in the sentencing powers of the sheriff and district courts will benefit the operation of those courts and the criminal justice system generally. That greater flexibility should help to relieve pressure on the system—the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson) in earlier debates and considered as desirable. It would also enable the sheriff courts to determine the most appropriate sentence for the cases before them without the need to remit to the High Court for sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increasing the sentencing powers of the courts is not a back-door means of incresing sentences imposed on individual offenders. It is simply a practical step that responds to evidence that the courts could function better with extended powers. More serious cases can be tried locally in the sheriff court, which could result in such cases being dealt with more speedily and improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system. Where the offender is aggrieved about the level of sentence imposed on him, he may appeal. That would enable the Appeal Court to express any general view about the adequacy of the sentence in relation to the offence involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
It has been suggested that the extension of summary powers restricts the present rights of the accused to be tried by jury where the offender faces serious charges. There is no inherent right in Scots law for an accused to be tried by jury. But in any case, sheriffs and stipendiary magistrates already have powers in summary cases to impose sentences of imprisonment of 12 months for certain drugs offences, of nine months for cases of police assault and resisting arrest and six months in a wide range of statutory offences and certain repeat, common law offences. Both are therefore already used to dealing with serious offenders within the remit of their present summary powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the changes will benefit the operation of the courts. Of themselves, they should not lead to significant increases in sentences. Rather, they will allow better distribution of business among the courts enabling them to determine the most appropriate sentence for the cases before them without the need to remit to the High Court for sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are similar in that they request that sentences be increased from five to 10 years. Section 5(2) of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person who attempts to have unlawful sexual intercourse with any girl under the age of 13 years shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years".</p></blockquote>
To protect young girls from sexual predators it is of paramount consideration that the penalty for such offences should be sufficient first, to deter an individual and, secondly, to punish an individual who commits the crime. Prolonged periods of incarceration will be the only adequate means of protecting society given the high rate of recidivism and the low rate of successful treatment. That is why that period should be increased from five to 10 years. There have been debates on the issue for several months. The need to protect society from individuals who commit such crime is important, but the need to ensure that, when such individuals return into society, the public are not more at risk than before the offenders went inside is equally important. We need closely to examine that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I visited Peterhead and looked in on the STOP programme I was able to have a discussion for a whole afternoon with prisoners who had committed sexual offences. After an hour or so a couple of prisoners said, "What you should do, Mr. McFall, is ensure that people like ourselves get life so that the Government have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
handle on us and we are no longer a danger to society." When such people come out of prison they may not have adequate housing and may be alienated from their families. That would make them feel more vulnerable. It is important for society to keep track of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments aim to increase the number of years for which an individual can be imprisoned. They would send an important message to society about those crimes and the need to keep track of such offenders when they get out of prison. People would not be exposed to more danger than they were before the offenders went inside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Cronin case, in Peterhead, an individual served his sentence, got out and persisted in the same kind of offence. We cannot allow that state of affairs to continue. The prison authorities in Peterhead and elsewhere knew that Cronin was as big a danger to society when he came out as when he went in, but they could do nothing.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the support offered by the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker). I welcome the amendments and I hope that the Minister will be minded to support them. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton has said, we should send out a message that that kind of crime will not be tolerated.

I wish I had been a member of the Committee when two years was considered to be suitable because I would have said that such a sentence was far too light for an extremely serious crime.

We have learnt from the media in the past few years of case after case of women's lives being wrecked because of sexual abuse perpetrated against them—even when they were tiny children. Some people have spent years abusing children close to them in their own families or in their neighbourhood. They have managed to get away with it or, when found guilty, have received a light sentence which tells the offender that the crime does not matter too much.

We must ensure that everyone realises that the offence is intolerable and that it cannot be treated lightly by imposing short sentences. The crime affects people in many ways—it wrecks their lives, makes it impossible for them to form normal human relationships, destroys the self-confidence needed to work and makes it hard for them to live in society. It is high time society understood that and said that those who commit the offence will pay the appropriate penalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to what has been said. I have every sympathy with those who agree with the need to increase protection for girls who are the victims of serious crimes. Telling points were made by the hon. Members for Dumbarton and for Maryhill and by my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside. In the context of the evidence, it is difficult to decide what additional headroom may be appropriate or necessary. In the circumstances, I shall reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased with the Minister's response. We look forward to debating that matter on Report and seeing him agree to our proposition. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
