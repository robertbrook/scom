	<time>Tuesday 3 December 1996</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 29</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PRISONERS HELD ON REMAND</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to draw the Minister's attention to subsection (2) of the clause, which provides for the retrospective grant of early release days, determined by the extent to which adverse reports have not been made by prison staff to the officer responsible for granting early release days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the prisoner will have no right to be notified of such reports and no right of reply. I want to probe the Minister on that point to discover whether the clause will create a two-regime system for remand prisoners and other prisoners. If that is the case, why not have just one set of early release provisions relating to all prisoners, including those on remand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When passing a custodial sentence, courts are required to have regard to time spent in custody on remand. Usually, this will lead to a backdating of the sentence to cover remand time. Clause 29 provides that, in such cases, the prisoner's behaviour on remand will be assessed retrospectively with a view to the award of days of early release. Matters such as the notification to the prisoner of the determination of the assessment and the prisoner's right of appeal against the determination will be dealt with in prison rules. The new section 39 of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 makes provision for rules to cover these matters in relation to both clauses 28 and 29. Remand prisoners will have similar rights and responsibilities to those of sentenced prisoners. The main difference is that obviously it is not known, in the case of remand prisoners, whether they will be found guilty, and receive a backdated custodial sentence. That is why, in their case, the award of early release days has to be retrospective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 29 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 30 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 239: that Clause 30 be transferred to end of line 3 on page 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As explained in my letter of 25 November to yourself, Mr. Martin, and to members of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
Committee, we have come to the conclusion that clause 30 was wrongly situated in part III, concerned as it is with the setting of a sentence, rather than with early release. For that reason, I seek the Committee's agreement to its removal to part I of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The media is here to report the Committee's proceedings, not to read newspapers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 31</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>AMENDMENTS TO 1989 ACT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 163, in page 29, line 15, after "days", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to each individual assessment period".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may also consider amendment No. 164, in page 29, line 31, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"which may subsequently be awarded to that prisoner.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that once early release days have been earned, they cannot subsequently be forfeited. That would assist in ensuring that the early release scheme is seen as credible and predicatble, and would also provide adequate incentives for serving prisoners. In addition, on the issue of early release days—with 12 days available within each two-month period—it would appear to be common sense that prisoners should be confined to those days and, once earned, they should not be subject to retrospective loss. That is simply a matter of equity. Once a prisoner loses an early release day in a two-month period, it should not be possible subsequently to regain the lost day. Similarly, once a prisoner has been awarded early release days, they should be secure. What is the Minister's opinion on that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's arguments for the amendments. He considers that it would be inappropriate that a prisoner should stand to lose any more days than those he has earned in the period when he committed a breach of discipline and that he should not lose days that he stands to earn in the future. I do not share that view. The number of days that a prisoner can lose should relate primarily to the seriousness of the breach. To limit the punishment by reference to the number of days of early release in a specific assessment period is to create an arbitrary link of no relevance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister could expand on what he regards as the seriousness of the breach involved where a prisoner may lose those days. Obviously, if it were a serious breach of discipline, such as an assault on a warder, the prisoner would be charged as if he had committed the offence outside of prison: he would appear in court and be sentenced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What kind of serious breach would justify going back for years and losing time awarded for early release? If it does not involve a further prosecution by the Crown, it cannot be that serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Disorder can be serious and does not necessarily involve a direct assault.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What sort of disorder?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends upon the circumstances of the case. It might be that threats are issued. For example, I have mentioned that a prison officer told me that a hammer had been thrown at him when his back was turned. He did not know who had done it. Nobody could be charged for assault. In some circumstances, however, it is not unreasonable that the culprit should forfeit days and that decision should be made at the prison governor's discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the worst answers I have heard from any Minister at any time. I asked the Minister to give me an example where someone would lose days of entitlement to early release because of a serious breach of discipline. He gave the example of a case where a hammer is thrown by an anonymous prisoner and, although the warder does not know who threw it, someone loses a whole series of early release days. The Minister is beginning to talk nonsense in our proceedings and should start to deal with the problem seriously. I asked him to tell me what kind of disorder would justify such a response. Surely we are not talking about prisoners losing years and years of remission because of an argument in prison where someone threatens someone else. In such circumstances, they should lose the total number of days that they have earned in that period, but not those in previous periods as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In incidents where hammers are thrown, someone should be charged and taken to court. Of course, the person who threw the hammer needs to identified—unlike the case that the Minister gave as an example, where nobody even knew who threw it and so, presumably, the whole prison was—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The incident of the hammer led to those sitting around the table being locked up and not getting out for other purposes for a considerable period of time. The early release provision did not apply in that example. However, if there is disorder, it is not unnatural for the prison governor to take a serious view of the situation and, when the identity of the culprit can be established, that prisoner should forfeit the days at issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the prisoner who threw a hammer at a prison officer could be identified, I should hope that, for such a serious offence, he would be charged, taken to court and sentenced instead of losing days of entitlement to early release.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but the problem with that case was that the prison officer did not know who had thrown the hammer. The hammer throwing example may not have been the perfect one with regard to early release because, as the hon. Gentleman has said, the culprit could not be identified. Where a prisoner can be identified, however, it would be appropriate for that disorder to lead to forfeiting of early release days. There may be other breaches of prison rules—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the hammer was severely punished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of incidents in prison where the culprit is not identified is that all prisoners lose out on privileges. Often, the other prisoners will not come forward to identify the culprit. If they do, the matter is simple. When a breach of prison rules can be clearly identified with an example of disorder, the forfeiting of days is appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the example of a hammer being thrown from a table where six or eight prisoners were sitting and no one knew who had thrown the hammer. Everyone at the table was punished collectively because no one would point the finger at the person who had thrown the hammer. Would all those at the table lose their entitlement to early release back to the beginning of their sentence, or only for the relevant period? The Minister gave the example, so he should explain how the measure will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave the case of the hammer throwing as an example of disorder, not as an example of forfeiting early release—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Let us follow this through. If early release is to be forfeited, what the individual has done must be known—that is well accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read in the papers today the eloquent words of the hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham). Under the headline,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Betrayal of a family man"</p></blockquote>
it was stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Two killers are to be released from prison in time for Christmas only 13 months after receiving a three-year sentence for kicking a young father to death."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am absolutely appalled that these two killers could be released in such a short time. I shudder to think that this Christmas the lady concerned will be without her husband while these two thugs will be free to enjoy the festivities with their families."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman is complaining about early release. We strongly defend the provisions in the Bill that make it clear that early release is a privilege to be earned, not a right. Misbehaviour and disorder in prison should be punished with the forfeiture of days. We stand by those provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were to speak to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde, he would say that he is appalled at the way in which the Government have run the law and order system in Scotland. That is the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not answered our questions, which we asked in all seriousness. The thrust of our comments is to ensure that good order is maintained in prisons. The answer given to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) shows that early release days may be taken away en masse. We can extrapolate from that information that a whole prison could lose early release days. That would be nonsense, because the clause covers individual cases and assessments. We want to know exactly who will make the decision. Prison officers will make the assessment, but if there is a retrospective element, is it not fair that the governor should be involved? The governor is responsible for the good order and environment in the prison. Judges and others have said that if good order is to be maintained in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>311</span>
prison, policy must be consistent and clear. We are seeking that consistency and clarity from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister referred to the hammer-throwing incident. A group of people might have been known to have been in the area from which the hammer was thrown. One of three of four people might have been responsible for throwing the hammer, but none chose to give information. All showed insolent and disrespectful attitudes towards the warder and no concern for the warder's state of health after being hit by the hammer. There was not enough information to take the matter to the courts to get a conviction against any one person who threw the hammer. With those attitudes and the general expectation that behaviour should be reasonable, would it not be just for the prison authorities to make a judgment on the general behaviour of those prisoners and, if they feel that they have not conformed to expectations of discipline and good behaviour within the prison, to adjust their early release expectations accordingly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another case might be where one of the assembled company has nothing to do with the crime and does not support it but is frightened to give information in case he suffers physical consequences from his fellow inmates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ensure that I have this absolutely clear. The Minister said that the clause would not apply to the hammer throwing incident, as it could not be charged to one individual. In the case of the hammer throwing incident, would we proceed against all those individuals or would we seek to drop the case because it could not be proved who had thrown the hammer in the first place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is in a hole of his own making as a result of the answers that he has given. The Opposition believe that, if entitlement to early release is to be lost, it should be confined to the relevant two-month period in which an offence occurs. The Minister says that it should go back to the beginning of the sentence, which may cover many years, and certain prisoners could lose early release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister for examples of the kind of disorder that could justify a prisoner losing entitlement to early release right back to the beginning of his sentence, and he came up with two examples. The first was the hammer throwing incident, which, under pressure, he now admits was not an example that would apply in these circumstances because it could not be proved which prisoner threw the hammer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second example was of two murderers who were given early release after 13 months. By definition, that example does not apply either because they had not committed an offence and there was no deprivation of their entitlement to early release. The Committee is still waiting patiently for the Minister to give an example of the kind of disorder that would justify someone losing his entitlement to early release backdated for seven years of his sentence rather that just for the relevant period. I should be grateful if the
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
Minister would now tell the Committee of such a circumstance, because he is the one who thinks that it should be in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow on from my hon. Friend because we are interested in finding out whether it is an individual or a collective assessment. I caution the Minister about taking the thrust of the argument of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) much further because before I came to the House, I was an assistant head teacher, so I have experience of disciplinary matters. I was often called into a classroom where there had been an incident with a teacher to which no one would own up. Let us say that the hypothetical child of the hon. Member for Ayr was in the class. I know what would happen. If I were to say that the entire class was to be punished—33 of them—and that they would get nothing for the next week, somebody such as the hon. Member for Ayr would say, "Why are you punishing my child, she didn't do anything." I would have to say, "That's right, but we want to get to the heart of the problem." We are not just using a blunt instrument to get to 30 people. That is the whole issue. We have to use our time and resources to understand exactly what the issue is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about individuals. Would the hon. Gentleman be happy if his child was in a class and somebody came along and said arbitrarily, "Right, all privileges lost for the next month." because someone unknown, maybe some hooligan, had done something and his child was going to be punished? Is that what the hon. Gentleman is looking for?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was a schoolmaster. The situation that he described has been apparent in the past, both in my school days and when my children were at state schools. Whole classes have been punished for the actions of one or two individuals within that class and privileges have been withdrawn. I am sure that that has been part of the system for a long time and I certainly have no objection to it if it gets to the heart of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what we call a limited, bigoted point of view. The hon. Gentleman would not be happy if his daughter or his family was going to be punished for the misdemeanours of somebody else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that I have known instances in the lives of both my daughter and my son in state schooling and during my schooling, which goes back much further, in which such instances occurred. Never at any time have I registered a complaint. In one instance, the result that the teacher wanted came about, so I certainly would not want to complain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious amendment which must be considered seriously and not approached frivolously. In a controlled, disciplined environment, such as a military environment, it was standard practice to withdraw privileges from groups because the identity of the perpetrator of a crime was not certain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Member's point, which I accept is a serious one, but the Bill is drafted not to

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members seem willing to accept the example of their own children being punished for something they have not done because, in the case of punishment in a school classroom, they are talking about something relatively trivial, however unfair it might have been. But presumably they would not support the kinds of thing that were done when the Nazis were ruling Germany, when the inhabitants of an entire village were killed because no one would come forward to name the person who had done something to damage Nazi interests. Therefore, Conservative Members are not making a total case. It does not mean that it does not matter if it is relatively unimportant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am getting a wee bit confused. I think the hon. Lady was intervening.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I think that I have set a hare here and that you will pull us back into order. I am interested in individual cases of early release, so we shall not go down that road any more. But I ask the Minister to reply to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of points. First, with regard to proceeding against all prisoners or one prisoner in an episode, only those who can be identified as having taken part can be proceeded against. The proof must be beyond reasonable doubt. That applies to all breaches of discipline. All those involved could be disciplined if there is evidence and the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked who makes an assessment on prisoners who have been remanded. It will be made by a board of prison staff chaired by the governor or other senior manager, in the same way as for convicted prisoners, and that will be prescribed in the prison rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are limits on the number of days' forfeiture that may be ordered. Up to 14 days can be ordered in respect of a single incident or up to 28 days where more than one breach of discipline is involved. It would be illogical for a lower limit to apply in relation to the days earned in the individual assessment period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have got a little, as the Minister says that the proof must be beyond reasonable doubt. That is fair enough. Secondly, he said that a senior manager would chair the assessment board and that that would be prescribed in the prison rules. We look forward to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also mentioned the maximum number of days that can be taken off, but we come back to our serious point about the retrospective element in terms of the good order that must be maintained in prisons. Perhaps the threats that could be made against certain prisoners would only increase the uncertainty and
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
destabilise the prison environment. With that in mind, we asked the Minister to consider the amendment, but, given his response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This continues points that were made earlier. The amendments would ensure that an offender was not triply punished for the commission of a single new offence. As the Bill stands, the offender would, first, be punished for the offence itself, secondly, be liable to recall to prison from the date of its commission and, thirdly, be additionally punished with custody for the period between the date of release from prison and the date of the new offence. That is retrospective punishment. In cases in which the original prison sentence was 12 months or more, there would be a fourth punishment for a single new offence because the clause will make such offenders liable to double the period of imprisonment for the new offence. Will the Minister comment on that triple punishment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would weaken the provisions in the Bill, which we have introduced to provide the courts with adequate sanctions to deal with released prisoners who go on to reoffend within a relatively short time of their release from prison. The amendments would shorten the period during which a court could order return to prison from the whole of the period of earned early release to just the remaining balance of that period at the point where the released prisoner committed the subsequent offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I have listened to the arguments of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), I do not consider that the arguments in favour of this change are strong. I do not wish to see the courts' powers in this respect reduced, and I regard it as appropriate that a released prisoner should risk losing the whole of any period of early release if he commits a further offence in the period that follows his release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consider that a prisoner who has been released early from prison owes a particular obligation to the community to lead an orderly and law-abiding life. For that reason, a prisoner who fails in this way and commits a further offence, either while he is under supervision or while he is in the period of one sixth of the sentence he previously received, should be subject to the additional sanction provided by clause 32. Where the prisoner has been released early from a long sentence, he could face return to prison for an appreciable period, and that period could be in addition
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
to the period imposed for the new offence; but that reflects the breach of faith that a return to offending represents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be argued that this provision may be severe. The subsequent offence may be regarded as minor, although we view even minor offences by released prisoners as a serious setback. But the answer is not to reduce the potential length of the period of return, as the amendments would. The court is not required to order the return of the prisoner if it does not think that return is merited, or it may order the return of the prisoner for a period shorter than the whole of the period of early release. There is thus ample discretion available to the court to consider the circumstances of the individual case and to make an order accordingly. It would be wrong to curtail the possible period of return, as the amendment would do, since that may prevent the court from dealing with due severity with the serious cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 253, in page 32, line 11, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) This section shall not apply to persons under the age of 16 years.".</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister intend that the clause's provisions should apply to persons under the age of 16? If so, that is required to be worded in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several points must be made about the question of crime defaulters under the age of 16. Across the broad range of crime defaulters, considerable economic, social and personal costs are involved. The level of default peaked in the 1980s at the same time as the use of the fine was declining. In 1991, fine defaulters accounted for 43 per cent. of sentenced first receptions to Scottish prisons compared with 26 per cent. in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That comparison is interesting because several reasons for Scotland's high percentage have been suggested, among them the severity of Scottish sentencing and the lack of responsibility by offenders. I find it hard to believe, however, that the attitudes towards that matter in England and Wales are significantly different from those in Scotland. However, there must be some explanation. Depth of poverty is substantial in various parts of the United Kingdom, but it is certainly a continuing problem in far too many Scottish towns and cities. That could contribute to the problem of fine default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some 90 per cent. of fine default prison receptions comprise unemployed persons. Fine defaulters typically have higher than average fines and pay off little before going to prison. A link between a fine default and no income has been demonstrated by several studies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions of mismanagement of limited income have come into focus in this matter. Obviously a person with a limited income—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady's contribution may be more appropriate for a clause stand part debate. She is raising matters of income, which would only apply in exceptional circumstances to someone who is aged under 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to move on to under-16s. I shall raise those other points under clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under-16s, being of school age, would be unlikely to have incomes—although they might be allowed to work for a short period before they reach their 16th birthday if they have left school for a few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be best if I simply ask the Minister whether it is intended that under-16s be exempted from the provision. The clause makes provision for contempt of court. With under-16s, will a distinction be made between those who may be unwise enough to express contempt in court and those who are technically guilty of contempt of court because they are too frightened to give evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful to the Committee if I explain how the early release
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
provisions will apply to children. I am talking here about the children sentenced to determinate periods of detention after they have been found guilty by a court. I am not talking about children dealt with under the children's hearing system. So it is worth noting that we are talking about relatively small numbers of children and very much the most serious offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these cases, the children will be detained in secure accommodation until at least 16 and often until 18, depending on their circumstances and behaviour. By the age of 18, they will have transferred to a young offenders institution and those serving longer terms will thereafter transfer to an adult prison after age 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By virtue of clause 29(5), the early release provisions of clause 28 apply to such children as they apply to adult prisoners. That is to say, they will serve the whole of the determinate period in custody as ordered by the court unless they are granted early release which can be up to one sixth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recognising the different circumstances applying to these children while they are detained in secure schools, special provision has been made in subsection (6) so that their behaviour does not have to be formally assessed when crediting them with early release days. They will receive these in full while they are in secure accommodation. Once they transfer to the young offenders institution or adult prison, they will be assessed in exactly the same way as the other inmates. We regard this as both fair and appropriate. The offences we are talking about that children can commit are very serious, including such crimes as rape, armed robbery and culpable homicide, and it is very regrettable that these crimes have been committed by children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that in clause 34 we were talking only about fine defaulters and persons convicted of contempt of court, not young persons who have committed rape.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As for the provisions on early release, which is what we are discussing today, there is no reason to distinguish children whom the court orders to be imprisoned for fine default from adult fine defaulters. If the hon. Member wishes to come back on that question I will be prepared to answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to seek clarity. Is there a minimum age at which one can be found guilty of fine default and, if so, what is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene to allow the Minister time to find the answer? My hon. Friend makes a very fair point. The amendment deals with exempting under 16-year-olds from the provisions that relate to those who are sent to prison for fine default or contempt of court and may be sentenced to three months or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about youngsters under 16 who commit very serious offences and get determinate prison sentences for perhaps four, five or six years. Therefore, they do not come under, and they are not affected by, this particular amendment. It is a probing
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
amendment to discover whether there are any youngsters under 16 who are sent to prisons or to secure units because of fine default or because of contempt of court and whether they would be caught up within clause 34.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very simple probing amendment and the Minister is getting himself into a fankle again this morning. Maybe he should address himself to the amendment and not speak about something completely different, as he has done so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to persons being fined under 16, it is technically possible but it is unlikely.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, would it be in order for the Minister to accept the amendment unreservedly, since it does not really affect anybody in the real world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly prepared to look at the amendment of the hon.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 259 is a probing amendment to find out whether testing for alcohol applies to all prisoners, whether they are convicted or on remand. We believe that the clause is unclear and we do not know whether it applies to all prison inmates. The amendment simply seeks clarification from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 260 is a minor amendment for grammatical purposes. It has been noticed by someone in the legal fraternity that the Scottish Office and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
clerks who draft these Bills have made a grammatical error and the amendment is to correct this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 254 and 255 come from the Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. They state that offenders with a problem of alcohol abuse, which may also be related to their offending behaviour, should be encouraged to participate in an alcohol education programme. That would provide them with an opportunity to learn to amend their use of alcohol in the expectation that, if they reduce their alcohol use on release, they will have an improved likelihood of also reducing their offending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SACRO recommends that such programmes should be available to prisoners, but it is essential that they are based on certain theoretical models and that they are properly evaluated. SACRO believes it to be essential that such alcohol education programmes are run by approved bodies and that they are of high quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us back to an earlier debate in Committee where there was concern that, because .of the inadequacy of resources made available to the prison service, its programmes were not properly staffed and were run by people who were properly-qualified. In the event, prison warders have been encouraged to do overtime and to run some of those programmes—perhaps as a cost-saving measure, but that would not really apply in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also draw the Minister's attention to an example I heard of when I attended the national poverty hearing here in Westminster. A man who spoke at that hearing spent some time—perhaps four or five years—in Barlinnie prison for a very serious offence. Because of his personal circumstances and his alcohol addiction—which led to his becoming an alcoholic—he ended up offending and going to prison. In prison he was able to give up alcohol and to turn his back on it and I am sure that he was able to benefit from the programmes that were available to him then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, those programmes will be of benefit to no one if the Scottish Office does not radically alter the circumstances facing a prisoner when he comes out of prison. When that man eventually emerged from prison,
	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>
returned to Glasgow and asked for council housing he discovered that, because he was in arrears in his tenancy he was not eligible to be allocated a council house. The council had been instructed by the auditors not to allow the man a new tenancy until his arrears had been cleared. The man was then placed in the Simon community, which looks after vulnerable people at a cost to the same council of some £300 per week. It would have been much easier to have cleared the arrears and given him a council house. He could not take up further education and training while in the Simon community or he would have been thrown on to the streets because to qualify for a place there he has to be entirely dependent. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

This is a very worthy group of amendments which I hope that the Minister will take on board, particularly those from SACRO. Even more importantly, I hope that the Minister realises that when prisoners come out of prison at the end of these programmes and try to adjust to society there can be problems. We owe them the opportunity of at least starting a new life.
