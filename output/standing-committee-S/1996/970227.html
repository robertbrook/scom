	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the Minister for the letter that he sent following Second Reading. It was helpful and will contribute to our deliberations today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1 would clarify clause 2(1)(a). The term "crofting interests" lacks clarity and could refer only to owners or tenants. I should like clarity on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 would ensure the inclusion of a community dimension in what we are considering. As far as I am aware, out of the consultative process there developed an intention that the Crofters Commission should adopt the concept of community development. However, that is not specified in the Bill and it is important that it should be. Local community development is central to the concept that the Committee is considering and it would be remiss not to include it in the Bill. Reference to the extent to which a transfer would enhance the potential for community development would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to encourage people to go to make a life for themselves in the remoter areas in the highlands and islands. Recognition in the Bill of the importance of community development would generate confidence among those who are engaged in such activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness and Sutherland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to deal with amendments Nos. 16 and 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Under clause 2, the Secretary of State could dispose of crofting interests only to a body that was
	<br><blockquote><p>"representative of the crofting interests",</p></blockquote>
and which had
	<br><blockquote><p>"the promotion of the interests of persons residing on such property as its primary objective."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 16 would substitute the term "the people" for "persons", to make it plain that the body concerned should represent the entire community in the area, and not simply a number of persons residing on the relevant type of property. The crofters will be the dominant interest on most of the Secretary of State's crofting estates. They will form the body to which the transfer might be made. It is important, however, to include the interests of non-crofters resident on the estates in the articles of association, or any other document that establishes the body. It should not represent a handful, or even a majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our experience of how crofting trusts might work is limited and based especially on the Assynt crofting trust. If such trusts are to work, a consensus about the desirability of establishing a trust, its purpose and its organisation for the benefit of the community, is vital. The use of the word "persons" in clause 2(1)(b) makes it theoretically possible for the promotion of the interests of a limited number of residents on the estate to be the measure's primary objective. That is not satisfactory. The term, "the people" is comprehensive and emphasises the necessity of taking into account the interests of everyone who lives on the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 17 is similar to amendment No. 3, which the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) tabled, but is more specific. Some people might consider crofters' interests to lie in early disposal of the property. The property might be handed over to people who were not interested in developing crofting interests. The articles that set up the body might not make it sufficiently plain that the crofting trust had in mind,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the economic and social wellbeing of the … community",</p></blockquote>
not the short-term economic interest of the majority who established the body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House and the Committee has, or should have long-term interests in mind. Dominance of the trust by a group of individuals who are prepared to pass on the title at the first opportunity, possibly to an absentee proprietor for a sum that is in their short-term interest, would not fulfil the Bill's objective. The purpose of the Bill should be beyond doubt or peradventure. The absence of a reference to the economic and social wellbeing of the community as opposed to the interests of the persons is unduly restrictive, and I believe it appropriate to widen what is covered by the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton and by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland. The Minister can probably confirm that originally the Bill referred at clause 2, line 15, to the interests of the "crofting community", not to
	<br><blockquote><p>"promotion of the interests of persons".</p></blockquote>
As the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland has pointed out, the number of people who are crofters on an estate can be a minority of those who live there. Some different phraseology is therefore necessary. But,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
as the hon. Gentleman said, "persons" could refer to just one or two persons and any organisation set up to run the estates in future should represent all the interests of all the people who live in the estates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 1, tabled by the hon. Member for Dumbarton, would require any crofting trust to be representative of the local crofting community. That would extend the remit of a crofting trust in two ways. It is our understanding that the term "crofting community" would normally include the local residents in any crofting estate, together with persons such as doctors, teachers and ministers living outside the estate but forming part of the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By introducing a reference to the community in the district of the property to be disposed of, the amendment would require that a crofting trust represent the interests of not only those directly involved in the estate, but those on neighbouring land which may be in private ownership or form part of the Secretary of State's crofting estate that has not been transferred to crofting trust status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that members of the wider local community, such as doctors, teachers and ministers, and others living outside the estate, should be taken into consideration when the Secretary of State considers proposals for crofting trusts. The Bill provides that the Crofters Commission shall have regard to the general interests of that crofting community when advising the Secretary of State. However, we do not believe that a crofting trust should be placed under a duty to promote the interests of those who are not resident on the land that it owns. The Bill as currently drafted would not prevent non-residents from being members of the trust, or from benefiting from its objectives. It does, however, mean that the interests of the residents would be primary, as is only proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 16 would require a crofting trust to have the promotion of the interests of the people residing on the relevant property as its primary objective. The Bill, as drafted, uses the term "persons" instead of "the people". Although, on one interpretation, the amendment could be said by implication to require the trust to ascertain collectively what the interests of "the people" were and to promote them, there is a further interpretation. I am advised that the effect of the amendment could be to require that a trust should simultaneously promote the interests of every individual on its land, even where those interests were conflicting or mutually exclusive. This would, I suggest, place a potentially impossible duty on any crofting trust. It could, in effect, give any individual a right of veto over decisions taken by a trust for the good of the crofting community as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, clause 2(1) will ensure that a crofting trust will be properly representative of crofting interests and will promote the interests of those living on the estate. Its management role will involve making decisions that are designed to promote the interests of residents, but it is inevitable that there will be occasions when trusts cannot satisfy the wishes of all tenants. All landlords at some time may face such situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Amendment No. 17 would require crofting trusts to have the purpose of maintaining and developing the economic and social well-being of the relevant crofting communities. The term "crofting community" would include doctors, teachers, ministers and others not resident on an estate but who formed part of the community. The amendment would therefore extend the remit of a crofting trust to include responsibility, in part, for people not resident on the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 would require the Crofters Commission, when advising my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on proposals for crofting trusts, to have regard to local community development in the district in which a property to be disposed of was situated. The hon. Member for Dumbarton said at the Scottish Grand Committee that if the Bill's central objective is to strengthen community development in sparsely populated areas of Scotland, then it needs to be strengthened in a number of ways. My noble Friend Lord Lindsay has made it clear that the concept of local community development lies at the heart of the Bill. However, I cannot agree that the Bill needs to be strengthened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary. The Bill as drafted already allows the Crofters Commission to take account of local community development when preparing advice to the Secretary of State. It can do this when considering the general interests of the crofting community, as it is required to do, or as any other matter which the commission considers to be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "local community" is also, I would suggest, uncertain. The local community could include more than just the residents on the property to be disposed of. It is quite proper that the commission should have regard to the development of a wider community, but such development, which goes beyond the land and members of a crofting trust, cannot be of such importance that the commission should be required to give it special, or preferential, attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will allow the commission to give due regard to local community development when framing its advice to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I would therefore ask the hon. Member to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the Minister's reply rather disturbing. The language that he used to interpret the words of the Bill did not appear to be a natural construction to put upon them. He sought to define the interests in clause 2(1)(a), which relates to the representative of the crofting interests, as the interests of people possibly outwith the estate, including doctors, teachers and others who may work in the estate for the benefit of the community. If that was what he was saying, I do not understand why their interests should not be among those to be considered under subsection (1)(b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point because it is crucial. Is he saying that the only people whose interests are to be involved in the formation of the trust are the crofters; or can they also choose to elect doctors and others who serve the crofting community? If that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the Minister's view, it seems inconsistent with that body not having the duty to protect the interests of such people, whether or not they may be resident within the confines of the estate to be transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point that the Minister made about "persons", he sought to suggest that use of the words "the people" might require the trust to reach a view that was unanimously acceptable. That defies reason. The people might be regarded as having their interests protected if they were predominantly of a particular view, but unanimity would be to go against the meaning of language. It is important that it should be predominantly the interests of the people, not just persons who could be a small minority of the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, the Bill is seriously defective and capable of causing great difficulties in administration. It could give rise to widespread anxiety among those in a crofting community owned by the Secretary of State who may feel themselves in a minority and at risk. These people might be prepared to do anything to prevent such a development. I hope that the Minister will think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found disturbing the Ministers remarks on the related issues raised in amendments Nos. 3 and 17. Surely a body set up to take over ownership of the Secretary of State's property should not be designed to dispose of it in the short-term interests of perhaps a relatively small number of people who would stand to gain from a further sale onwards, when the interest of the community would clearly be the development of the estate, perhaps by way of a reduction in rents being used for administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill remains unamended, it will lend support to the impression that the Government's objective is simply to disembarrass themselves of ownership—hence that this is simply privatisation, not development. I cannot believe that that was their intention. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister shakes his head. I do not believe that that is their intention; I am not making that charge. I am making a serious point. I do not wish to be misunderstood, but the fear is that that is how the measure could operate. It is important to get this right. The Secretary of State should not be allowed to dispose of property for the short-term benefit of the handful of people who are considered to be representative of the interests of an estate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a serious point here that needs to be explored in some detail. We must make clear who will run these estates, and for whom, if a transfer of ownership occurs. Three groups are involved: crofting tenants, who live on the estates; other residents who are not crofters or tenants; and perhaps transitory residents—holiday home owners and so on. Transitory residents are not, of course, at the centre of our concern, but it is important to remember that non-crofting tenants have a right to be considered and represented in the proposed structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Stornoway estate in my constituency is run by the local community. In the past, only crofting tenants could elect members to a trust that operated the estate; they alone had a vote and a say in who would run it. But
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
they numbered only 1,000 among the estate's 20,000 general population. Problems arose on account of only 1,000 people having the sole and exclusive right to nominate members and to decide how an estate would be run. That is the sort of problem that subsections (1) and (2) would create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer the point about the phrase "of persons" perhaps meaning one, two or three persons. On some estates crofting tenants are as few as that. He said that if the word "people" was used instead, some notion of unanimous consent of all the people and interests being promoted simultaneously would be required. That may be so, but it is a tortuous construction. If the words "of persons" remain in the Bill, the result could be that the interests of one, two or three people could be promoted by a particular decision. That would not be satisfactory because the majority of people might be excluded. The Minister must think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "of persons" is different from that contained in the original draft of the Bill, which was sent out for consultation. That draft contained the word "community". I understand why the change was made, but it suggests that there was doubt in the Minister's mind about the right phraseology. I do not think that he has yet found the right phraseology, so he must do a little more work to find it. The Bill's wording throws up a profound and difficult problem about democratic accountability and the running of estates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will forgive my ignorance of these matters; there are not many crofts in Maryhill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask about the meaning of paragraph 2(1)(b). If a person merely uses a croft as a holiday cottage, that person is in a different position from someone who belongs to the community and earns a living from a croft. As far as I can see, the Bill's wording means that those people will have equal rights. That is unfair. When tenants of council properties are balloted on whether they want to create a housing association, each vote has an equal weight because everyone is in precisely the same position. In this case, people are not in the same position. What does the Minister think of attempts to counterbalance the rights of the crofting community with the rights of those who use the crofts as a second place of residence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland on his insight. We want to make it clear to the Minister that we want to promote the economic and social well-being of communities in the highlands and islands. The amendments sit well with the Government's rural White Paper because they would lead to consultation with those communities. We do not want a possible recipe for discord, but the promotion of harmony and the wider interests of the community. With that in mind, we ask the Minister to reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to clear up some misunderstandings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(1)(a) and (b) will require the trust to make the promotion of the interests of the residents its primary objective. That includes crofters, their families
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
and any other persons normally resident on the estate. However, the crofters will decide whether they wish to invite non-crofters from the wider local community on to the trust board. Similarly, if local crofters wish to establish a wider trust, which may include land that is not part of the Secretary of State's estates, that option is open to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of the membership of a trust is different from the point about for whose benefit the trust will be run. I see that the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) accepts that. There is no restriction on the persons who might become members of a trust. However, those running the trust must show that they will do so for the benefit of crofting interests—pwhich is a much wider term—and those residing on the estate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trust should be run not simply for the benefit of the wider crofting interest, but for the benefit of the wider community interest. The wider community interest is encapsulated by the use of the phrase "the people".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of "the people", the combination of paragraphs (1)(a) and (1)(b) will ensure that the interests of a small group of persons are not the only ones taken into account. We do not accept the interpretation of the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland that the expression "the people" means the predominant number of the people. The Bill as drafted covers the point that the hon. Member for Western Isles is trying to ram home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. member for Caithness and Sutherland that the long-term development of a community is important, but the amendment would extend the responsibilities of a trust to make it a statutory requirement that a croftinage trust maintain and develop the economic and social well-being of the broader community. That is unacceptable. The Crofters Commission will be able to take account of all community developments when advising the Secretary of State. I hope, with those assurances, that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remain so unhappy about what the Minister has said that I ask him whether he is willing to reconsider the amendment at a later stage. If so, I shall not press the matter. I am not being perverse in seeing a risk in what is proposed. In an intervention on clause 2(1)(b) about the purpose of the trust, the Minister spoke of the promotion of the interests of the community—those were his words—but that is not reflected in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"has the promotion of the interests of persons".</p></blockquote>
The word "community" does not appear. The Minister used that word and it is important that that term, or some such word, appears in the clause for the reasons that he gave. The language of the Bill does not reflect the Department's intention. I so much hope that the Minister will rectify that that I will not press my
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
amendment to a final conclusion if there is any prospect of the Minister giving it further thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Bill as drafted covers the points made by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland, I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister would reconsider the matter. His key point, in response to my question, was that the commission would have regard to the general interests of the crofting community. But that is only when considering the decision whether to set up a trust. Once a trust is in operation it should be under a duty to have regard to the interests of the wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland suggested that if "the people" is not acceptable as predominant because of the construction, to use the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"the promotion of the interests of the community residing"</p></blockquote>
on such property would capture the sense of what we are trying to achieve. There is a big gap between saying "of the community" and saying "of the community" and saying "of persons". The Committee would appreciate it if the Minister would reflect upon the matter because we are speaking with experience of these communities. We can tell the Minister that if the clause is as narrowly drawn as it appears to be, and if he turns down the suggestion of "the community" as being adequate phraseology, many people who currently reside on Department-administered estates and who have considerable confidence that the Department will administer these estates in the interests of the whole community, will not be so confident about the prospect of these estates being administered by what could be a small group and a minority of crofting tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate the comments made by hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
make to the Secretary of State within the affected community and to each crofter within the community prior to offering its advice to the Secretary of State.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The background to the amendments is a particular case. The Minister will be aware that the process of considering whether or not a trust should be set up in Armadale has begun. A suubstantial number of crofters have expressed concern about the mode of consultation that has been put in train. The amendments would ensure that advice offered by the Crofters Commission to the Secretary of State on the desirability of disposing of property to a particular body would be based on a genuine community consensus of what is in that community's interests:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some concern that the Crofters Commission—as a body appointed by the Secretary of State and which has a partly legalistic role under existing crofting legislation—might not be as sensitive to all strands of opinion as is desirable in a matter of such huge importance. It is common ground that transfers to a trust, as contemplated by the Bill, would work effectively and without dividing the community only if they enjoyed broad-based support from the crofting township within the estate. That lay behind the success of the Assynt crofting trust. There was virtual unanimity that it was a desirable objective. There was clearly a long history of landlord oppressiveness and unwillingness to co-operate in development of the estates. That stood in the way of enlargement of the economic and social life, which would maximise the benefits of crofting tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State takes the view that there is no history of oppressiveness in the management of the Department's estates. Many may think that the Department's objectivity and its interest in fostering development can be taken for granted. There will not, therefore, be the instant enthusiasm from the Secretary of State for the setting up of a trust that there is in some parts of the west highlands where conditions are different. If the voice of those communities is to be heard—and I have no doubt that that is the intention behind the proposal to give the Crofters Commission a consultative role—the commission must follow procedures that are seen by the crofting community to be open, deliberate, careful and responsive. Those procedures should allow a reasonable amount of time to elapse between each of the stages. Each of those stages should be clearly published so that people have no sense of being bounced into a decision that they may not perceive to be in the long-term interests of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what lies behind the amendments. I might not have thought of moving them had it not already been clear that the actions taken in the Armadale case had given rise to such anxiety. It is important to recognise that because that was an early case there are lessons to be learnt from it. The sort of procedures that I am recommending are not unreasonably burdensome on the Crofters Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 simply makes certain that everyone knows when views should be made known and how that should be done. Amendment No. 11
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
would ensure that the advice that is being offered by the commission should be given not privately but openly and should be known to the community so that the community can comment on that advice if it seems out of line with its thinking. I admit that it probably would result in protraction of the consultation process, but in a matter of this kind I cannot see that there is any case for hurrying to reach a conclusion. It seems to me desirable that the process should be arrived at deliberately if the purpose is to arrive at a consensus. If that is done the trust approach has great merit and would be likely to commend itself in many instances. It is an entirely welcome development and I hope that my proposals will be seen as measures to strengthen the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. It is important to have a clear indication of the process by which consultation is to take place. What sort of consensus is the Minister looking for when it comes to assessing the mood of a particular crofting community? Any trust must be set up with the consensus of the entire community if it is to be successfully established and run in the long term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 15 would require the commission to publish a schedule of meetings and opportunities for individual representations to be made within the crofting community by affected crofters and any other residents. Amendment No. 11 would require the commission to publish any recommendations it may propose to the Secretary of State in the affected community and to each crofter within that community before offering its advice to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland about the process that we and the Crofters Commission intend should be followed when the commission prepares advice for the Secretary of State. The commission would intend in most circumstances to hold meetings and to offer other opportunities for affected crofters and other residents to make their views known to the commission. lain MacAskill, the chairman of the commission, made it clear when giving evidence to the Select Committee of another place at a meeting in Inverness that the commission would adopt a consensual approach to the consideration of proposals for crofting trust status. That would involve, as a matter of course, discussions with crofters and other residents affected by the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 would require the commission to produce a formal schedule of meetings and other opportunities. The circumstances of individual cases might be better served by less formal contacts with those affected. That applies especially to small communities, and would allow individuals to express their private concerns about any proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the commission's intention is in line with amendment No. 15. However, the commission would benefit from the flexibility to adapt its approach to the needs of individual cases in the terms that the Bill currently allows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 11 would require the commission to publish and send to each crofter the advice that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
proposed giving the Secretary of State before offering that advice to the Secretary of State. The commission is the Secretary of State's statutory advisory body on crofting. In that capacity, it would advise the Secretary of State on proposals for crofting trusts. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for its advice to be subject to consultation before it was offered to the Secretary of State. Mr. MacAskill has already made it clear that he would be content for advice to the Secretary of State to be made public. The commission would make copies of the advice available on request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those affected by the proposals would be able to make submissions directly to the Secretary of State, who would consider them with the advice from the Crofters Commission. We do not intend to exclude anyone who is affected by the proposals from the consultative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would restrict the commission's ability to adapt its approach to individual circumstances. I hope that my comments reassure the Committee that the Government and the Crofters Commission will ensure that no crofter, or other resident affected by the proposals, is excluded from the consultative process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland replies to the Minister, I wish to make a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the process constitutes individual consultations with crofters, it relies on those who undertake the consultation to provide an overall view. If the community is unhappy with that view, nothing prevents it from organising an informal meeting. That could cause further problems if its outcome contradicted the official view. Therefore, the Minister would be wise to accept the amendment, which would ensure that everything was out in the open and clear. I do not understand the disadvantage of accepting the amendments. The Minister and Mr. MacAskill agree that the views of the community should be sought. It would be better to do that in a more open manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear about the consensual approach to which the Minister referred. Does 51 per cent., 70 per cent., 90 pe cent., or 99 per cent. in favour represent a consensus? Does support have to be unanimous? If a township wants to plant trees on part of the common grazing land, does every tenant have to agree to that? The transfer of an estate from Department control to a separate, independent trust is a bigger decision than whether to plant trees on common grazing land. Would the same rules of unanimous consent apply to both decisions? I hope that the Minister will clarify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply is more encouraging than his earlier remarks, although I am not wholly satisfied with his response, especially to amendment No. 15. I accept that he wants consultation to take place in the form that the Crofters Commission considers appropriate to enable it to reach a conclusion. However, I cannot understand how a requirement to show the way in which the Crofters Commission wishes to conduct the consultation limits its discretion. The proposal simply requires the Crofters Commission to
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
state how it proposes to exercise that discretion. The language that I have used does not exclude consultations taking place in some other way besides that of a published schedule of meetings and published opportunities for individual representations. It would still be open to the commission, if it remained in any doubt about individuals' views, to hear them otherwise than by the specified arrangements. It is important, however, that people should know about the month, or two or three months, in which opinions could be expressed. Time should be allowed for people to consult their advisers, such as lawyers or accountants. Simply to summon meetings speedily, without advance warning, and to attend only to the voices raised at those meetings, would not be a proper approach. I do not think that it would be in the mind of the present Crofters Commission to proceed in that way. In making the law we must consider all possibilities. I hope that the Minister's remarks broadly reflect the way in which the commission would proceed, but the likelihood of that being so would be strengthened by my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point was made about the commission being the Secretary of State's statutory adviser and about the consequent inappropriateness of its advice being known. It struck me as curious to suggest that the advice should be secret prior to being given to the Minister. It seems to me that it would and should carry much greater weight if it were published, and if it were known to have perhaps not unanimous but broad, support from the community. That would give it authority. However, I understand that the Minister has made up his mind on that matter. I acknowledge that it is unusual for bodies that give advice to Ministers to publish it in advance, but the circumstance that we are discussing is unusual. It is more important that the advice given should reflect the view of the community at large than that convention should be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As to amendment No. 15, my noble Friend Lord Lindsay and I have already explained that the Government and the Crofters Commission want the process of consultation to be open and consensual. If the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, I shall be happy to undertake to consider the matter further, along with amendment No. 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for the Western Isles asked me to define consensus. A better opportunity to thrash that question out might be available when we return to it late. However, Mr. MacAskill has made it clear that the consensual approach will involve the commission working with communities through meetings and other contacts to facilitate agreement. I do not want to impose an arbitrary percentage threshold, because that could prove divisive. The hon. Gentleman would probably agree that it is unlikely that consensus could be reached on setting a figure to determine consensus. I have already given an undertaking about returning to the matter, and perhaps that would be of use to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 22, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Any subsequent conveyance from a transferee to a new owner of property disposed of under subsection (2) above shall require the consent of the Commission.".</p></blockquote>
The Minister will be familiar with my comments on this matter on Second Reading, in the Scottish Grant Committee, and, indeed, with respect to the Committee deliberations in the other place. The matter was the subject of extensive deliberation when we took evidence at Inverness. I shall not go over the arguments other than to say that we think that there is still a danger that a trust's land could be sold later. For example, in Assynt, capital assets—mainly land—have been sold to raise income to maintain the trust's activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his letter to me, the Minister was kind enough to elaborate on those points. He assured me that, under the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993, the approval of the Scottish land courts is required before a landlord can resume crofting land for purposes other than crofting. The court must be satisfied that the land will be used for a reasonable purpose. I am pleased with the Minister's answer on that, but the amendments underline our concerns. We seek assurances from the Minister on the degree of control that the Scottish land court will exercise in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would appear from the hon. Gentleman's remarks today and on Second Reading in Montrose that the amendment is designed to deal with two concerns. The first is that the land transferred to crofting trusts could immediately be transferred to third parties, and the second is that there are insufficient safeguards against taking land out of crofting tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As crofting trusts are required to be representative of the crofting interests on the estate, any disposal of assets would be likely to be undertaken only with the support of the trust's members, who form the crofting interests on the property, and in the interests of the residents on the estate. One of the major purposes of the Bill is to allow crofters on the estates to take local decisions to address local needs. Decisions on the disposal of land are a normal part of ensuring the efficient running of an estate. The Government do not wish to impose controls that suggest that the members of a crofting trust will be unable to decide on what is best for their own community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crofting trusts will, in any event, be subject to the normal safeguards designed to protect land in crofting tenure. The Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 requires the approval of the Scottish land court before any landlord can resume crofting land for purposes other than crofting. The Act requires that such resumption only be made for "reasonable purpose", which it defines. Legitimate uses include dwellings, allotments, churches, schools and other community assets. In making its decision, the court has regard not only to local circumstances, but to the effect on the amount of land remaining in crofting tenure. Crofting trusts will be subject to those statutory safeguards in the same as any other crofting landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to accept the amendment, we would be introducing restrictions on crofting trusts to which no other crofting landlord is subject. That would be unfair

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause because it raises questions about the costs that will fall on the new trusts. An amendment was tabled suggesting that the Government should be empowered to defray expenditure on the maintenance of roads, bridges and other assets with a wider community purpose that will be owned by the trusts. Unfortunately, the amendment was not selected for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will make clear how the Government intend burdens such as the maintenance of bridges and slipways to fall upon the trusts. Some trust estates have historic houses and castles on their land; some have sewerage works. All those assets have accumulated accidentally over years and the Department administers them. If the burden of running them and paying for them were to fall on trusts, the load would be substantial. The Department owned estates in Benbecula in my constituency and spent considerable sums on basic works such as sewerage and drains. In 1992 it spent £7,500 on cleaning the drains, and further amounts in subsequent years to a total of £17,000 in three years. That is a huge burden for a trust's crofting community to take over. One assumes that future trusts would not take on such burdens, which would remain with the Department. The Bill does not clarify that, so we look to the Minister to do so when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause empowers the Secretary of State to provide financial assistance towards the establishment costs of a body to which properties are transferred and towards the legal expenses and other costs associated with the transfer. The setting up of the new body, and the transfer to it of an estate or estates, usually requires some expenditure on certain items—conveyancing, for example—and the Secretary of State may wish to provide assistance. We have made it clear that community assets will not transfer to trusts. My noble Friend Lord Lindsay stated specifically in the other place that the drainage system in Benbecula would not be transferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little puzzled about the clause, especially about how it lies with clause 8(4), which provides that nothing
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall impose any charge … on public funds".</p></blockquote>
How is it possible for the Secretary of State to provide assistance without imposing a charge on public funds? That gives rise to the wider question of whether it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
appropriate for the Secretary of State to provide such assistance only in respect of setting-up costs. I would have liked to have examined the possibility of the Secretary of State helping to defray costs on the capital infrastructure of an estate in the manner described by the hon. Member for Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of retention of those capital assets by the Secretary of State arises under new clause 1, but on the assumption that it is not carried and the assets are transferred, a very substantial burden could be imposed. I feel that it is worth considering whether the Secretary of State should contemplate empowering himself to give assistance not only on setting up, but on future maintenance of the estates. The Bill does not provide for that, but if the Bill were not so narrowly drafted the matter could, perhaps, be considered later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify clause 4. The Scottish Crofters Union has expressed concern that the clause would work to the detriment of crofting townships, because section 7 of the Congested Districts (Scotland) Act 1897 would have allowed certain costs to he defrayed by the Department. If that section is removed, those costs will end up falling on crofting townships. Can the Minister clarify the purpose of clause 4 to help me and the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Disapplication would allow crofting trusts to undertake work necessary to obtaining title.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would happen if clause 4 were not included in the Bill and section 7 continued to apply?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I can be of some assistance on that point. I have made clear my strong interest in the point raised by the hon. Member for Western Isles. The Crofters Commission is concerned that the Bill might result in the withdrawal of support that would otherwise be available, and it is desirable that that should be made available. The Minister would help the Committee by answering on that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of inspiration, I can tell the hon.

to carry the cost of certain operations. He is trying to reassure us by saying that he could defray the costs under clause 3, but that will be an option open to the Minister rather than an obligation incumbent upon him. Clause 4, therefore, suggests a potential loss to the country community. I am not minded to allow it to pass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who is usually a stout advocate of the Law Society, is taking a rest this morning, so I may be acting on his behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsequent amendments in the group relate specifically to the proposal in amendment No. 5 regarding any right of pre-emption being extinguished when the Secretary of State disposes of property. The amendment was tabled to ensure that the right be extinguished only on disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society has informed me that amendment No. 6 specifies the circumstances in which the Secretary of State would have to advertise a disposal which affects a right to pre-emption, and would make provision for compensation for loss of rights of pre-emption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 would create alternative compensation arrangements for claims before the land court of Scotland. The Law Society is firmly of the opinion that issues should be adjudicated on by the land court. Amendment No. 8 would allow for a deemed acceptance of a claim for compensation as there may be circumstances in which acceptance of a claim for compensation is ambiguous, or unclear to the claimant. The amendment would allow the claimant to deem acceptance from indications given by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 does not propose a definition of "disposal", as clause 5 does not. Amendment No. 9 would ensure that the issue of disposal is adequately defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am broadly in sympathy with the amendments of the hon. Member for Dumbarton. Can the Minister say whether extinguishing a right of exemption, as the clause proposes, extinguishes a right of property without compensation, and whether he is satisfied that that would not fall foul of the European Convention on Human Rights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would make alterations to provisions relating to extinguishing the right of pre-emption and the procedure for dealing with claims for compensation for loss of those rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 appears to provide that rights of pre-emption shall he extinguished only on disposal of the property. However, the Bill ensures that any right of pre-emption over a property would be extinguished at the point at which the disposal of that property was affected. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 would require the Secretary of State to notify holders of right of pre-emption on the disposal of property to a crofting trust. It would also require him to make reasonable inquiries to identify such holders and to advertise for claimants if inquiries were unsuccessful. We have made it clear that the Government intend that where the Department believes that an individual or organisation may be entitled to claim compensation we shall give them notice to that effect. This may happen where the estate to be transferred to a trust previously formed part of a larger estate which still belongs to the family of the original owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Placing a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to try to identify current holders of all rights of preemption would, however, cause special difficulty. Unlike the practice for rights of pre-emption in private sales, there is no paper record of the right that would identify transfer from one owner to another. As few, if any, of the original owners of the land in question are likely to be alive, there is no readily accessible and definitive source of information that can be used to identify the current owner of any rights. In those circumstances, an attempt to discover who may have a right of pre-emption would be disproportionately expensive and would offer no guarantee of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also stipulates the nature of the advertisement that the Secretary of State would be required to place in order to notify owners of rights of pre-emption that they have a right to compensation. It may be that the most effective way of reaching such potential claimants is not to advertise in a newspaper circulating in the district in which the property is situated, but in other journals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also have the effect of reducing the period allowed for claims for compensation from four months to six weeks. Following debate in the other place, the Government agreed to increase the period allowed for claimants from six weeks to four months. The Bill will extinguish the right of pre-emption, so it is only proper that the Government deal fairly with those whose rights have been removed. We accept the argument that six weeks would be insufficient to ensure that potential claimants are informed of their right to claim compensation and subsequently to lodge compensation claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that the timetable for claims of compensation will have no bearing on the transfer of property to a crofting trust. The right of pre-emption is extinguished when a property is transferred to a crofting trust. Only after that will claims for compensation be entertained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 would require that, within six weeks of a claim being notified to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State must notify the claimant that the claim has been rejected. Otherwise, the claim will be deemed to have been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would place an unfair and unwarranted burden on the Secretary of State. The Bill does not require that all claimants submit all supporting evidence when first lodging a claim. The nature of rights of pre-emption, which arise from the Land Settlement (Scotland) Act 1919, is such that the evidence that claimants might submit is likely to vary from case to case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Claimants would lodge their claim and, following that, the claimant and the Secretary of State would discuss the level of proof which could be furnished and which the Secretary of State would be able to accept. That process may take some time. As there is no requirement on the claimant to submit particular evidence, the amendment would impose an unreasonable burden on the Secretary of State. We accept that it would not be fair on claimants to require that they submit a fully documented claim in the first
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
instance. Therefore, the Bill imposes no requirement that the Secretary of State respond within a given period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure the Committee that the Govenment will deal with all claims as speedily as possible. Given those assurances, I ask the hon. Member for Dumbarton to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a particular sympathy for amendment No. 6. As the Minister said, it would reduce the time in which someone could submit a claim from four months to six weeks. My worry is not that the clause will extinguish a right of property, but that people who are ignorant of their right to a property until they receive notification from the Department will pop up out of the woodwork and claim compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society is carrying out a review of feudal rights and the right to pre-emption to which they give rise. Therefore, it is paradoxical that we are thinking of compensating people for a value that would not exist without the Bill. Amendment No. 6 would justifiably strengthen the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also help if the Minister could tell us what he wrote to the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) who, on Second Reading in the Grand Committee, referred to the court cases in which Ross and Cromarty council is involved and the way that they impinge on feudal rights of property. New developments are taking place that might have an impact on the claimed right of pre-emption. At the end of that debate, the Minister said that he would respond in writing to the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye. It would have been helpful if the Committee had received copies of any letters before we began our deliberations. They are germane to the matter. An important point was made on Second Reading and it would help if the Minister could tell us what he told the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland made a point about the European convention on human rights: the right of pre-emption is thought to be a right of property covered by the first protocol to that convention. Accordingly, clause 5 provides for the payment of compensation to the holder of right of preemption and the payment of reasonable compensation satisfied our obligations under that convention. I am happy to give the hon. Member for Western Isles a copy of the letter that I sent to the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief because the matter has been referred to tangentially in other debates this morning and it was also mentioned on Second Reading at the Scottish Grand Committee. We are Still concerned about the burdens which trusts may have to shoulder. The Minister mentioned earlier this morning that the drainage system in Benbecula would not be included. Clearly, that is welcome. If a burden is transferred it will be at some time in the future, following something unforeseen. A crofting trust that was established in good will and was viable at the beginning could face an intolerable situation. The new clause has been tabled to flesh out the Government's views and to bring reassurance to individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the new clause. The Minister in the other place resisted similar amendments, but it remains the profound view of the Scottish Crofters Union in particular, and a number of crofters in general, that the transference of this liability could have such significant costs that it might militate against the setting up of a trust and the disposing of the property. That would be unfortunate. The bridges, roads, sewers, drains and so on are there for the benefit of the public generally and would properly fall not on the expenditure of the proprietor, but on the public purse. It will be argued in some quarters that that is trying to have one's cake and eat it, but that is not quite the way to view it. Some structural capital investments are clearly the responsibility of the proprietor—for example, field drains—and it would be preposterous to suggest that they should continue to be financed by the Secretary of State, although grants might be available for the purpose. However, it does seem that such things as roads, which are in general use, should not fall upon the crofting townships as a burden in the event of the property being transferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add to what the hon. Gentleman said and to point out that other burdens fall upon the Department in respect of some estates. In Barra, for example, I believe that the Department is responsible for arresting the effects of coastal erosion. Again, that would be a huge burden to place upon a new trust. I should therefore be grateful if the Minister would refer not just to those activities, but to those in the wider category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause would have the effect of requiring the Secretary of State to retain responsibility for the maintenance or upkeep of any bridge, road, sewer or drain on an estate after it had been transferred to a crofting trust. It may be that the hon. Member for Dumbarton wants to ensure that the Government do not transfer to a crofting trust any responsibility for maintaining assets that benefit a wider community than the estate itself. If that is the case, I can confirm that the Government agree that it would be inappropriate for such responsibility to be transferred to crofting trusts. My noble Friend the Earl of Lindsay said in the other place that we would seek to transfer the normal maintenance and repair responsibilities that go with ownership, but would not seek to transfer responsibilities for community assets. I hope that we have the Opposition's support in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would not achieve the desired effect because its terms are too broad. For example, there are drains and roads on some estates that benefit only the crofters on those estates. and which therefore would form part of the normal maintenance and repair responsibility that goes with ownership. It would not be fair to the taxpayer were the Secretary of State to continue to pay for maintenance and upkeep of such assets when the only beneficiary was a crofting trust which was enjoying the benefits of ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Members will be reassured when I reiterate the Government's intention to retain
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
responsibility for assets that are of benefit to the broader community and to transfer only those burdens that form part of the normal maintenance and repair responsibility which any landlord would expect to undertake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those words of reassurance which, as the Minister said, follow those of the Lord Lindsay, are welcome. What would be even more welcome would be if the Government were to seek to encapsulate those assurances in language in the Bill, so that successive Ministers might bear their responsibilities in the same way that he and his colleagues intend to do now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say to the hon. Gentleman in all honesty that, for a long time into the future, it will be the responsibility of my colleagues and me to ensure that the assurances being given are the ones that will be carried out. For that reason, there is no need whatever for the Bill to bind a successive Government because the successor to this Government will be another Conservative Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is surely right for crofting trusts to take on the same responsibilities as any other crofting landlord. Decisions about which estates are appropriate for transfer and which estates might remain with the Secretary of State will be made sensibly, on a case-by-case basis, after detailed discussions between the relevant parties. In the light of our assurances, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
