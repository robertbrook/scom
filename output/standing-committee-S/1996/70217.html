Local Government Finance</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p>1. <span class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what assessment he has made of the benefits of giving local authorities additional funds to eliminate the backlog of people awaiting help for adaptations, extensions to their homes and placement in nursing homes. [14706]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Substantial resources have been provided to local authorities to meet the needs of community care client groups. It is for local authorities to determine how those resources are deployed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. I wrote to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 22 January and I have not yet received a reply. Like many of my colleagues I have constituents coming to my surgeries to tell me of their problems in relation to the matter. People are holding beds in hospitals when they should be back in their homes with the adaptations and extensions that they require. Many others are awaiting places in the community and want to return there. I accuse the Government of transferring the responsibility from the national health service to local authorities without there being proper and adequate funding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's letter will be answered as quickly as possible. I shall look into the matter.<br><br>
The number of blocked beds in Midlothian is about 20. The authority and the health board are aware of the situation and the hon. Gentleman will be aware that we allocated an additional £15 million this year to help health boards deal with peaks in admissions during the winter period. The Midlothian health board's share of that was £2.1 million.<br><br>
As for resources in Midlothian, the housing association grant for 1996–97 was £1.27 million and there is also a special needs capital grant. The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration will soon meet Scottish Homes and that will be one of the issues that will be considered. About £750,000 has been committed to assist with the re-provisioning associated with the closure of Gogarburn and St. Joseph's hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that one of the problems we are facing is the fact that the huge sums of money transferred from the national health service to local authorities have not been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
spent as wisely and as well as they could be? For example, the £200 per head of population in this county and in Perthshire demonstrates clearly the difference between making use of what is available in the private sector and the local authority in its role as provider. In fact, the local authority should be an enabler, not a provider, if it cannot provide at the same price.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that the inspectors' report in relation to Tayside found that the three councils, Angus, Dundee City and Perth and Kinross, could make savings of between £3 million and £6 million a year to make more use of the independent sector. That suggests that between £33 million and £66 million could be saved in Scotland, which would mean that far more people would be placed in appropriate accommodation. The report said that the standards were comparative between the public and private sectors and were of good quality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why cannot the Minister understand that beds are currently being bought in national health service hospitals? Patients who have been assessed as needing nursing home care cannot be discharged to available beds in nursing homes in the community, because local authorities do not have the funds to pay for those available beds. If the Government can find £60 million for a royal yacht and £70 million to double the military cadet forces, why cannot they find the money for the national health service and for elderly people in this country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain to the hon. Gentleman that the funding for community care has increased enormously in recent years. The amount of extra funding for 1996–97 is £56,513,000 for Scotland—an increase of 8.5 per cent. for community care. For social work, it will mean an increase of 6.4 per cent. overall. The hon. Gentleman will be interested in the recent comparative study into local authority expenditure that is before the Committee this morning. It confirms that each person resident in Scotland receives £27 more per head than each person in England in respect of social work. The Scots are doing well in comparison with everyone else in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why does not the Minister come clean and tell us that the agenda is the privatisation of residential care in Scotland, and say that the Government have no other objective in mind? At the same time, why do not he and his colleagues start telling the truth about this year's local government settlement? The so-called saving of £60 million from local government reorganisation really represents a major cost to local authorities because of the gerrymandering of local council boundaries two years ago, for which the Government were responsible. Does he not realise that, all over Scotland, people know the truth; they blame the Government for the sacking of teachers, home helps, and care assistants which is a direct result of the settlement? Last year, his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland was forced into a humiliating U-turn at the Kilmarnock meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee. Surely, in their dying days, the Government will have the decency to make yet another U-turn.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Stewart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Points of order are taken after questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a question of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) will be aware of the statement made by the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown)—the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer—about his extreme reluctance to increase income tax. That statement straight away undermines the local government campaign of the hon. Member for Hamilton.<br><br>
On the question of the private sector, we are arguing for more and clearer information for residents so that they can make informed choices as often as possible. We propose to publish a new directive on information which will require authorities to publish the comparative costs of residential home care for the elderly. One of the key points, which I have stressed already, is that the standards of quality are comparable between the private and the public sectors and, therefore, value-for-money issues are all the more important to ensure that funds are properly and appropriately applied.</span></p>

Scottish Borders Council (Finance)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>2. <span class='member'>Sir David Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the effect of the local government financial settlement on Scottish Borders council. [14707]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The council can increase its expenditure by £2 million next year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Steel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am dumbfounded by that answer. That is what we were told a fortnight ago. The Secretary of State was courteous and listened to the council and Members of Parliament. I thought that he understood that, with a background of low-spending councils, people in the borders are extremely angry at cuts in basic services, especially those affecting the quality of education. Those cuts are the result of capping limits and the frugal grants that the Government have given to local authorities. However, the Government have given councils greater statutory responsibilities, which means that they must increase their expenditure. The Secretary of State promised to consider that a fortnight ago, but he has not yet come up with an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman's question was about whether I would make a statement on the local government financial settlement on Scottish Borders council. The effect of the local government financial settlement is that the council can spend an extra £2 million. It is important that people in the borders should be aware of that, as the convenor has been telling people that the effect of the settlement will be cuts in expenditure, whereas the reality is that the amount that Borders council can spend is less than it would like to spend.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman has raised a separate point about the position of councils that are close to their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
grant-aided expenditure in terms of spending and the effect of capping levels, about which I hope to say something in the debate later this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, perhaps it would be better to wait, but I should like to reinforce the point made by my right hon. Friend. After the expectations that have been raised, it would be unconscionable if today's sitting passed without the Secretary of State saying something about flexibility and capping.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Capping is a complicated subject. I will say something about it this morning. I happily pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Gentleman for the courteous way in which they have explained the position in Borders council, which is not unique to that council. I always listen to representations from hon. Members and take full account of them.</span></p>

Local Government Finance</div> <!-- title -->
<p>3. <span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland, when he will meet Glasgow city council to discuss local government finance. [14708]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have offered to meet a delegation of hon. Members and representatives of the council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my question has had such an immediate effect. I have a good mind to table a question this afternoon asking the Under-Secretary to ensure that Kvaerner Govan is given the order for the auxiliary oiler. I digress slightly. When the Under-Secretary meets representatives of Glasgow city council, will he be prepared to consider the argument that Glasgow is carrying an unfair burden on costs because of its metropolitan role? Is he aware that the Mitchell library in Glasgow is a resource for the whole of Scotland and that more than 50 per cent. of its users come from outside the city, but Glasgow alone bears the cost? Does he accept that business rates raised in Glasgow should be retained in Glasgow for the use of its citizens?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has covered quite an array of subjects. On Kvaerner Govan, he has been in contact with me and, as I am well aware, the Ministry of Defence; he knows that the matter is progressing.<br><br>
On the funding of bodies such as the Mitchell library, I think that the hon. Gentleman is talking about the distribution of funds throughout Scotland. As he knows, the distribution of local government finance is based on a formula that was agreed by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Office through the distribution committee. If he is saying that Glasgow should get more, he should ask the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) whether his constituents in south Lanarkshire would be happy to give more of their funding to Glasgow instead of receiving it themselves. COSLA has said that it is more than happy with the distribution formula as it stands, although it wants to review it in due course. The last thing it wants, however, is what the hon. Member for Hamilton advocated—namely, a totally independent review and assessment of distribution throughout Scotland.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Finally, does the hon. Gentleman agree with Glasgow city council, which this morning was reported to be targeting employees who live outwith Glasgow district in respect of their future employment prospects? That seem unjust.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, if newspaper stories and statements from Glasgow city councillors about votes for trips abroad and other items of high expenditure are true, that hardly creates a climate in which he is encouraged to help them financially?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has raised an interesting point. The allegations of jobs and trips for the boys in Glasgow—"travelgate"—do not make pleasant reading. As he will know, I have written to Councillor Gould asking him to come into the open and give details of all expenses paid to Glasgow city councillors during the past year, so that the public can be made aware of what has been going on, as I believe in open local government. Glasgow council tax payers and ratepayers do not want funds prioritised for such things.</span></p>

Air Passenger Duty</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4. <span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what assessment he has made of the impact on rural and island communities and the transport network at Scotland of the proposed increase in air passenger duty. [14709]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are giving the impact of the forthcoming increase in air passenger duty, particularly for sensitive routes in Scotland, their fullest consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why have the Government introduced this anti-Scottish airport tax, which will directly hit every commuter and raise business costs? If the Government truly want to lower taxes, why have they introduced yet another anti-Scottish, Tory tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Flights between the Scottish islands, which are operated with small aircraft, are exempt. In addition, there are increased levels of revenue support, allowing the Western Isles council to offset the impact of the duty in its subsidy of the inter-island Stornaway-Benbecula route, which is operated with larger aircraft. That has ensured that that route is affected by the tax in a similar way to the inter-island routes in Orkney and Shetland.<br><br>
In 1996–97, we gave a subsidy of £9.2 million to Highland and Islands Airports Limited for some 10 airports, and we also subsidised the lifeline air services between Glasgow, Tiree and Barra. We recognise the financial fragility of many air services, so we are giving the impact of the increase our political consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that the Government's open skies policy has brought great advantage to Scottish air travellers in recent years with a massive array of cheap flights between Scotland and other United Kingdom cities? Will he take account of the fact that the fixed rate tax disadvantages
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
some companies? Is it in his remit to suggest to my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer that in future airport taxes be related to air fares on a percentage basis rather than a fixed rate basis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly pass on my hon. Friend's comments to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Strong passenger growth has been experienced after the introduction of air passenger duty and it is expected that that growth wil continue. We also believe that the open skies policy is beneficial in bringing more tourists to Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman aware that the air passenger duty is only one part of the heavy transport burden that the people in the highlands and islands of Scotland have to carry? Will the Government consider instigating a wide-ranging study of that additional burden as it relates to air fares, ferry charges and excessively high fuel prices? Fuel prices in the highlands and islands are 11 per cent. higher than in urban Scotland, which must have a significant social and economic impact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have already offered to study such issues at the Highland convention; I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her support for that recommendation, which will arise again at the convention's next meeting.</span></p>

Skoal Bandits</div> <!-- title -->
<p>5. <span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what is his policy on Skoal Bandits. [14711]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='member'>: All oral tobacco products were banned on 1 January 1993.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it be reasonable to suggest that the Secretary of State send to Sir Gordon Downey his considered comments on the contents of pages 124 to 128 of the book "Sleaze" by David Leigh and Ed Vulliamy, which concern the delicate matter of lobbying for the tobacco industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be very happy to do that; I think that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the report in the book that my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) came to see me when I was a health Minister to make the case for not banning Skoal Bandits.<br><br>
The Government's position at that time was somewhat awkward because we were publicly committed to negotiating a voluntary agreement with US Tobacco on the sale of Skoal Bandits, while we were also seeking legal advice on the possibility of introducing a ban. The question before us was whether, by concluding a voluntary agreement, we would prejudice any subsequent ban and lay ourselves open to challenge. In the event, regulations to introduce the ban were laid, and we were challenged. Unfortunately, the Government were defeated in the courts. Regulations were then introduced under a European Community directive, which is why it took us until 1993 to institute the ban.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes lobbied a number of Ministries at the time, including the then Ministry of State, Department of Trade and Industry, Mr. Alan Clark, on which occasion he was accompanied by the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), who was concerned about the effects of job losses in his constituency. The only other representation that I received was from employees in East Kilbride who stood to lose their jobs—and subsequently did so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will know of the dishonourable campaign surrounding Skoal Bandits. The book "Sleaze" names him and his hon. Friend and asserts that the "No turning back" group was lobbying hard for those jobs. The Scottish Office gave £200,000 in grant for fewer than six jobs.<br><br>
Given the Secretary of State's involvement in Scotland against Drugs and other groups, will he assert this morning that Skoal Bandits which cause mouth cancer, especially in young people, have no part in the health programme in Scotland? We do not want them in Scotland; they are an anathema; the need for a good health programme is important; Skoal Bandits should be ruled out. Will the Minister give us that policy assurance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the hon. Gentleman must have prepared his question before he heard my answer to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, in which I made it clear that Skoal Bandits were banned on 1 January 1993 as part of an EC directive that applies throughout the Union. It is rather disreputable for the hon. Gentleman to attempt to make that an issue. The hon. Gentleman is obviously not aware that the grant paid to US Tobacco for it to establish itself in East Kilbride was regional development grant, which was introduced by a Labour Government, and over which Ministers had no discretion. We subsequently abolished it, so that all support is now discretionary. The hon. Gentleman ought to pay heed to the statement made by Madam Speaker a few days ago.</span></p>

Energy Efficiency</div> <!-- title -->
<p>6. <span class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland, what measures he intends to take to promote home energy efficiency schemes.[14712]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Home Energy Conservation Act 1995 was recently introduced in Scotland. It requires local authorities to draw up strategies for a substantial improvement in energy efficiency in homes. The Act therefore provides a powerful stimulus for the promotion of home energy efficiency schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the Government's decision to prioritise home energy measures will lead to many pensioners and others on low incomes being forced to choose between draught proofing or insulating their homes and that it will perpetuate the stark choice that many face between heating or eating? Does he also agree that the Government are failing to tackle the widespread fuel poverty in Scotland, which leads to 2,500 deaths every year from hypothermia—the worst record in northern Europe?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady seems to forget that we have asked local authorities specifically to target the most vulnerable when drawing up the scheme to which she refers. She also seems to forget that since the scheme was introduced in 1981, we have spent over £29 million in Scotland through more than 250,000 grants.</span></p>

Trunk Roads</div> <!-- title -->
<p>7. <span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland, if he will make a statement on the future of the trunk roads improvements programme for north-east Scotland.[14713]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In addition to schemes under construction on the A96 at Blackburn and Kintore, and on the A9 at Logie Easter, preparatory work continues on major improvements to the A96 at Fochabers and Keith and to the A92 at Balmedie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply; will he accept that there is some confusion over the position of the A92 improvements at Tipperty and the Keith bypass? I think that the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) will also say something about Fochabers. The Minister did not mention the Inveramsay realignment, which seems to have dropped off the list. People are concerned that the funding of those upgrading projects has been postponed indefinitely. Given the previous assurances that they are priority road improvements, how can the Minister justify stating that work is continuing without giving clear dates of when active construction will start?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wrote to the hon. Gentleman on 3 January explaining the position on the Keith bypass. The programme is under regular review. The A92 Balmedie road will be reconsidered in the light of available resources and competing priorities. Work is in progress on the A96 at Kintore and Blackburn, which will cost at least £20 million and bring the total spent on improving that road over the past eight years to more than £60 million; that includes major schemes at the Inverurie bypass, the Bucksburn diversion and the Lhanbryde bypass. We shall continue to support the necessary transport services to maintain the economic and social fabric of Scotland's rural areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the Keith bypass is under regular review; does not he realise that there is growing anger in the town at the fact that that has gone on for several years and we still do not have a commencement date? Could he give me an update on commencement orders for Fochabers? The Minister doubtless heard the people outside today who were arguing for improvements on the A92; does he realise the anger that is felt in north-east Scotland at the fact that the bulk of the trunk road programme money is being spent in the central belt?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I shall anticipate the hon. Gentleman who has just risen by saying that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is about to make an announcement on the subject of the A92

in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. I have stood down from the Fochabers project as I have a second cousin who had an interest in it—a route lay across his front drive. The Secretary of State has appropriately taken over the project; the statutory processes are and will be followed and all those matters will be regularly reviewed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Moray mentioned expenditure in the central belt of Scotland. I ask the Secretary of State, through the Minister, if he is aware that the part of the challenge fund that was put in by East Renfrewshire council to build the Glasgow southern orbital route has affected the savings that benefit my constituency in north-east Renfrew. Does the Minister support a request for challenge funding by suggesting that savings could be made in other constituencies, when East Renfrewshire council did not have the decency to discuss that with the constituency concerned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall look into the points raised by the hon. Gentleman. The Glasgow southern orbital road is being considered for challenge fund support. Were it to go ahead, it could improve access to Ayrshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister travelled here on the A92, he will know how totally inadequate that road is for the volume of traffic that it carries. We look forward to the announcement that the Minister is about to make. I hope that any funding for the A92 will also include a much-needed replacement for the Montrose bridge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unless my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State changes his mind between now and making a statement, that project is likely to get £ 1 million. I have every reason to suppose that my right hon. Friend will confirm that in a few moments.</span></p>

NHS (Private Finance Initiative)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>9. <span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the progress of the PFI projects within the national health service in Scotland.[14716]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Within the Scottish health service, 18 projects with a combined capital value of more than £55 million have been completed or contracts have been signed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to wish that this meeting was taking place in Cumnock. Will the Minister confirm that the Secretary of State received a PFI bid for the east Ayrshire hospital on 2 September last year, that the private bidder then asked for an extension to 1 November to revise its figures—a fishy thing in itself—and that, in February 1997, no decision has yet been made. Meanwhile, the people of east Ayrshire are deprived of much-needed health facilities. Will the Minister and the Secretary of State stop trying to fiddle the figures, admit that private funding is cheaper and better, make an announcement now and put health care before political dogma?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggested that private funding is cheaper and better.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did I say private? I meant public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to give the hon. Gentleman the correct facts. The trust was asked in December to consider further ways of closing the affordability gap. The PFI option is more expensive in the early years, but the total project costs of PH and public sector options are virtually the same. The trust and the bidder are considering ways of revising the bid and are confident that the gap can be closed further. The trust aims to provide a revised business case in the next few weeks and experience elsewhere is that it should be possible to start in late spring. If the business case can be approved in February, the trust and the bidders will need to complete financial and contractual arrangements, which can take several weeks. In conclusion, about 120 significant schemes are currently in the capital plans of trusts in Scotland. If private finance did not exist, we would need to prioritise. What it means is that public sector funds go very much further and that more projects can be got off the ground much more quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. and learned Friend remember that Angus welcomes the proposed Forfar community hospital and will he confirm that the private finance initiative is one of the options? We want that hospital built quickly and would be delighted if the PFI were the means of achieving that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All capital spending projects have to be examined to see whether they are appropriate for private finance. That hospital is no exception. In some cases, the public sector route will be more appropriate. We believe, however, that private finance has a major part in making public sector funds go very much further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Government categorically rule out, as a manifesto pledge, any PFI that involves the privatisation of clinical services?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not go as far as that. I entirely rule out privatisation. All services must be free at the point of delivery, but if there is strong local support, each case must, of course, be considered on its merits. The people of the north-east of Scotland will enormously benefit from the Stonehaven project, because they will get a purpose-built hospital with the best facilities much more quickly than by any other route.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The number of households assessed as homeless by Scottish local authorities in 1979–80 was 4,700. Figures for 1995–96 are not yet available, but will be published on 27 March.</span></p>

homeless people. Is not it an indictment of the Tories's 18-year legacy that we now have a record number of house repossessions, record unemployment, a record low in house building, and young people and others cowering in the doorways of many of our towns and cities because they have no roof over their heads? What positive policies will the Minister introduce to reduce the number of homeless people to close to the level that a Labour Government once thought unacceptable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman forgets—or, more probably, conveniently ingores—the fact that the figure fell last year; this year, Shelter, not the Government, expects them to fall further. The hon. Gentleman is trying to score cheap party political points in his usual style—before he gets up to speak and without having heard the answer to his question. He would, however, do better to congratulate all those involved in compiling the figures—central Government, local Government and the voluntary and private sectors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister said last December that he was going to withdraw the draft code of guidance on homelessness. How will he respond to consultation on it, given that there was no support for his proposals? Will he confirm, furthermore, that he will not take Scotland down the same road along which the Government have taken England by removing the requirement to provide permanent housing for homeless families?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is wrong to say that there was no support for my proposals—there was broad support for most of the draft code, although some aspects caused concern among local authorities and voluntary agencies that deal with homelessness. My right hon. Friend and I therefore withdrew the code and said that we would consider the problems and introduce an alternative to reflect particular needs and circumstances in Scotland. We are working on the revised draft, and I hope to publish it shortly.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister join me in congratulating Moray council on the imaginative initiative that it is launching today in conjunction with National Children's Home and the Aberlour Child Care Trust to improve facilities for children in need of care in the Moray area? Will he consider how local authorities and housing associations, which are vital in making provision in the community, can best ensure that the elderly, the young homeless and the handicapped enjoy the independent living that they seek?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady raises important points. As regards community care, there is to be a £709,000 or 7.2 per cent. increase over 1996–97, which should help.<br><br>
The Scottish Office community care implementation group has visited Moray and was impressed by the degree of inter-agency collaboration, the development of strategic thinking and the innovative approaches that the council had adopted. As well as looking after the young, the council is considering becoming an enabler for residential care for the elderly. It has suggested closing homes that are no longer fit for the purpose and transferring ownership or management to independent agencies. The council's starting point is to meet client's needs better, which is consistent with the thrust of our policy.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The capping controls are there to protect the council tax payer. In the case of the hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State accept that councils throughout Scotland are having to cut jobs and services to their communities as a direct result of his attitude towards financing local government? Does he further accept that the Secretary of State for Scotland should represent everyone and that it is unacceptable to impose cuts on the Scottish public purely and simply because of general election calculations?<br><br>
Would the right hon. Gentleman care to comment on the morality of his decision to spend £800,000 on political television advertising at the same time as he is cutting services and jobs in Scotland? The responsibility is his.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not cutting the resources to local government. There is not a council in Scotland that has not had an increase in its overall resources. I am surprised that the hon.

hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport. I have recently written to my noble Friend the Minister for Aviation and Shipping to draw his attention to the strength of feeling of the Scottish fishing industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the Marine Safety Agency has, without consultation, imposed on the Scottish fishing industry charges which have increased by a third both the hourly rate and the deposit, taking the deposit up by £300 to £1,300? The surveys are compulsory, which makes them a tax and, presumably, makes the increase the 23rd Tory tax rise since the previous election. When the Minister wrote to the Marine Safety Agency and his colleagues at the Department of Transport, did he ask them not to impose the charges and was he overruled, or was he merely going through the motions so that the would have some protection before the hard-pressed Scottish fishing industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, there was widespread consultation before the charges were increased. The agency has been making a loss of £1 million per annum and the increase in charges is to cover that loss.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the sinkings of the Copia and the Equinox show the urgent need for introducing safety regulations for fishing vessels less that 12 m long? Is he aware that at the fatal accident inquiry in Ayr last month, Sheriff Neil Gow failed to make any recommendations because he was assured by Commander Vale of the Marine Safety Agency that regulations were about to be brought in? The chief executive of the MSA has now written to me to say that they will not be introduced until early next year at the earliest. Will the Minister take this matter up with the Marine Safety Agency now and see whether the introduction of the regulations can be advanced, because the safety of many other fishermen in small boats depends on the regulations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, we are consulting the industry on the regulations proposed in the new safety code. I hope that he will agree that it would be wrong for Ministers to proceed until those consultations have taken their natural course and fishermen have had a full input. At the end of the day, we will consult and then introduce concrete proposals, as the hon. Gentleman has asked.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that Opposition Members are constantly carping about the amount of money that the Government spend on roads?

Will my right hon. and learned Friend recognise that the roads to the north are much improved? Will he consider the roads to the south and consider expending more cash on the A70 from Ayr to the A74?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be interested to hear that the published report shows that we spend £30 more per head of population on roads and transport in Scotland than we do south of the border. We are investing £521 million on roads over the next three years and we are making excellent progress on upgrading the A74 to three-lane motorway status. We are making steady progress on completing the cental Scotland motorway network, with the M8 and M80 projects due to start construction during the public expenditure survey period. That will include, not so far from my hon. Friend's constituency, major upgrading of the M77 between Floak and Fenwick. At a time of increasing pressure on public sector resouurces, the development of the private finance initiative to design, build, finance and operate schemes has permitted progress to be made on major strategic routes.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that we know that the effect of the jobseekers allowance has been, at best, to push people into part-time or short-working jobs, or off the list altogether, and given the admission of an English Minister about the gross understatement of the level of unemployment, which has been well recorded, will the Minister estimate the true level of unemployment in Scotland? Does he have the graciousness to allow those of us who prefer the evidence of our eyes and ears to know that we are right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Lady cannot recognise a significant fall—about 15,000 over the past three months—in unemployment in Scotland. She stands for a party which would hand over, as she calls it, independence in Europe—that is, hand over sovereignty to Europe—sign up to the social chapter, have a national minimum wage and adopt the working time directive—all of those things which would be bad for Scotland. She should learn that we have had remarkable success with the Government's policies in Scotland. Long may it continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister reflect on the fact that his claims about the fall in unemployment do not apply to every part of Scotland? In fact, while the United Kingdom average on the Government's statistics has seen a fall of 17.6 per cent. over the past 12 months, the increase in my constituency—Gordonhas—has been 21 per cent., which is more than 400 job

losses. Indeed, taking the countervailing trend into consideration, the loss is probably 800 as a direct result of BSE. Is he aware of the representations being made, especially by the specialist haulage contractors about jobs lost as a result of BSE? Will he consider Government help to reinvigorate that trade and prevent further bankruptcy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is prone to playing with figures. He talked of an increase of 21 per cent., but failed to point out that his constituency enjoys one of the lowest levels of unemployment in Scotland. I am sympathetic to haulage contractors who are experiencing difficulties because of the BSE situation. The export market has been totally and irrationally closed to beef from the north-east corner of Scotland, which is some of our finest. Indeed, I know, as will the hon. Gentleman, that Grampian Enterprise has devoted significant attention to the problem and to how it can assist small businesses, in particular haulage firms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend discusses employment with the Trades Union Congress, will he bear in mind the fact that employment in road construction is of great importance? Therefore, will he also bear in mind how pleased Dumfries and Galloway is that work is about to start on the major stretch of the A75 west of Dumfries, and on the major stretch from Johnstonebridge to Paddy Rickle bridge on the M74? Both projects will bring welcome jobs to an area that has not had sufficient recently.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had no representations recently from the Scottish Constitutional Convention, but I should be delighted to hear its answer to the Ernst and Young report, which was published in <i>Scotland on Sunday</i>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
yesterday, showing how the tartan tax would have a disastrous effect on Scotland's pensioners and would impose a burden of tax on people at every level, hitting hardest those on lowest incomes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the Secretary of State, not the Scottish Constitutional Convention, who is here to answer questions. In the event of a Scottish Parliament with tax-raising powers being established by a Labour Government, does he believe that there are circumstances in which a future Conservative Government at United Kingdom level would abolish it? If so, what are those circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not, but it is technically the case that Parliament is sovereign, although a number of Opposition Members have signed a so-called claim of rights which seems to distance them from that view. Parliament can do what it likes, but it must command the support of the people. In practice, once a Scottish Parliament is established, like a puppy it will not be for Christmas but for life. It would do enormous damage to Scotland's economic prospects and the prosperity of our people and would put at risk the funding of our vital services—health, education and social work. They are all generously supported under the existing arrangements, which opposition Members would put in jeopardy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gallie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that local authorities in Scotland never take responsibility for anything? They always claim that they are underfunded and point the finger at central Government as the cause of all their ailments. Would it not be the same with a Scottish Assembly? Would it not be a disaster, which would lead ultimately to independence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. I find it curious that opposition Members who want a tartan tax—an extra 15 per cent. on the income tax that is paid by those who are least well paid—argue for a Parliament, 97 per cent. of whose funding would be determined at Westminster; yet the same people argue that local government, 85 per cent. of whose funding is determined by the Scottish Office, does not have sufficient freedom to go about its business. Their attitudes towards capping in local government and capping the tartan tax are irreconcilable. If we had a tartan tax, it would rise inexorably. Such is the contempt of the Labour party for the Scottish people that its leader has put up posters in Scotland saying, "Guaranteed for five years: no increase in income tax rates". What about the tartan tax—or did Labour in Islington forget Scotland once again?</span></p>

May I ask whether you received any notice from the Government about a statement to be made on BSE and any underhand, backstairs deal that might be being made in London today between the Government and the Ulster Unionists? We are in the heart of Aberdeen Angus country, where farm incomes and farming families have been devastated by the crisis caused by the Government's ineptitude in handling the BSE problem. Surely in Montrose of all places we should be told by the Government what is going on. A deal with the Ulster Unionists would inevitably lead to disadvantages for the Scottish beef industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of order, but I have not received a request form the Government for a statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Stewart. Is it in order for a Front-Bench spokesman to use a point of order to make clearly incorrect points? Should not the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) bear in mind the fact that his party has put down a motion for consideration this afternoon which has drawn attention to the BSE crisis and which is certainly not in the interests of the north-east? It is extraordinary for the hon. Gentleman to complain about the consequences of his own party politicising a particular issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I cannot rule on a point of order until I have heard it. Secondly, bogus points of order are as old as the House of Commons itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Stewart. During Question Time, the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) said that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State should tell the truth. Is that in order? My point of order concerns whether there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
is a rule governing hon. Members telling the truth. It is not accepted that hon. Members, including right hon. Members, always behave honourably?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right on that point. Hon. Members cannot accuse other hon. Members of, for example, intentionally misleading the Committee. However, the hon., Member for Hamilton was in order; I know that because if he had not been, I would have ruled him out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Stewart. This is a real one, given your ruling. On the House of Commons Order Paper this afternoon, there is an amendment proposing to cut the salary of the Secretary of State for Scotland because he is just as culpable, and as big a failure, as the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the right hon. and learned Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg). Is it unusual, and is it in order, for the Secretary of State for Scotland not to be in the House of Commons to see the possibility of an amendment being moved to cut his salary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to assure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that that has nothing to do with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). Would it be in order for members of the Scottish Grand Committee to vote on the motion of confidence regarding the Secretary of State for Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that sounded like a genuine point of order either, and I so rule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it be a record, Mr. Stewart, if the Scottish Grand Committee were to meet without a bogus point of order being raised by the hon. Member for Hamilton?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot rule definitively on that. We should probably get on with the substantive debate. I now call Mr. Andrew Welsh to move the substantive motion for the adjournment of the Committee.</span></p>

Housing and Local Government Finance</div> <!-- title -->
<p>11.21 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.<br><br>
On behalf of the community of Angus, may I join Provost Duncan in wishing members of the Committee and the parliamentary officers and staff a very warm welcome to the town of Montrose, and to Angus? I am very biased, but I believe that this is the most beautiful part of Scotland. I hope that everyone who comes here today will return for leisure, as well as for parliamentary business reasons.<br><br>
I am sure that the Committee will wish to join me in expressing condolences to all who have suffered loss and illness in the recent E. coli outbreak in Arbroath. I commend the work of the health authorities, Angus council, and all those involved in combating the outbreak. I should also like to thank the Secretary of State personally for his prompt action, and for access to information which allows me to keep my constituents up to date with events. The situation has cast a shadow over innocent people in residential homes and over local business. It reminds all of us of the need to stand together in fighting this ghastly illness.<br><br>
Where I part company with the Government is on housing and local government finance. The Scottish National party chose this topic to highlight the extent of the Tories' anti-Scottish policies, and the devastating impact of Tory cuts on local government in general and housing in particular. The Government have tried to divert attention from their failure to protect Scottish public services, with a blatant propaganda exercise. Even the paid consultants who carried out the study on comparative expenditure admit that the report is fundamentally flawed. All that has been highlighted is the Government's determination to undermine Scottish local government and their total neglect of the Scottish people, who rely on the daily, essential services provided by Scotland's local authorities.<br><br>
This year's housing cuts are the most brutal to date. This year's housing budget, already slashed by more than 20 per cent., will next year be cut by a further 30 per cent.—some £177 million in cash terms. That will hit both local authority and voluntary sector housing. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations described 1997–98 as the worst peacetime year for housing investment since 1919.<br><br>
The cuts come as a result of the requirement that 75 per cent. of capital receipts raised by local authorities and 100 per cent. of those raised by Scottish Homes have to be used to repay capital debt. Last year, local authorities were led to believe that they would be required to pay 50 per cent. next year, and they made planning and investment decisions on that basis. The change to 75 per cent. is an appalling breach of faith, even for this Government.<br><br>
In a thinly veiled attempt to mask the cuts, the Secretary of State announced that he would be making £15 million available over three years for the long-overdue rough sleepers initiative. But Shelter calculated that for every £1 spent on the initiative, a further £35 has been lost to the overall housing budget. The Government are fooling no one with that particular manoeuvre.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
The SHFA observed:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is difficult to see the Scottish Office allocation to Scottish Homes … as anything but a disaster for Scottish housing".</p></blockquote>
Shelter estimates that the £177 million slashed from the housing budget would have provided resources to build 4,110 affordable homes for people who are currently homeless. Instead, those senseless cuts will result in an estimated 11,500 job losses across Scotland. They will have an especially detrimental effect on the construction industries and on small contractors that rely on local authority work.<br><br>
Here in Angus, the council faces a cut of almost 60 per cent. in available investment next year as a result of the debt repayment rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want to mislead the Committee, but he describes as "cuts" a requirement to use increased resources to pay off existing debt incurred on housing. Does he propose that the debt be allowed simply to grow and grow and never be repaid? That would not be to the advantage of tenants, who would pay for it in rent increases; nor is it a sustainable option.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has got it entirely wrong. By enforcing the 75 per cent. debt repayment, he is taking actual resources out of what is available for council housing services. In Angus, the loss to such services will amount to £3 million. As local businesses are responsible for repairs and maintenance, that will pose a massive threat to small businesses here and will have a detrimental effect on the service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point, which is that money being wasted on paying debt interest charges could be spent on front-line delivery of services. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that it is right to try to get the level of borrowing down so that more funds can be released for front-line delivery of services?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, the Minster fails to understand what is really happening. In fact, the problem in Angus is not great: our prudent financial authority has the fifth lowest debt burden in Scotland, yet we are being forced to take medicine for a problem that we do not have. It should be noted that the housing stock valuation is more than the total outstanding debt. The Government are hammering small businesses and hitting services without understanding the mechanism that they are using. Real cuts are affecting actual services, and the same pattern will be evident throughout the country.<br><br>
The Minister's choice of example shows that he has misunderstood totally the situation in Angus. He is hitting a prudent authority which otherwise would ensure that services are given to people—that is what the system should be all about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: By way of reinforcement to what my hon. Friend has said, does he realise that it is estimated that Moray council—another prudent authority—will lose about 125 jobs in the small contractor building trade? As a result of that clawback,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0370">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
400 houses in the area will not receive the central heating whose installation was planned for this year, and 450 houses will not receive new windows. Such amenities are vital for people living in the council house sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thoroughly agree, and the same is true for the housing associations. No new houses will be started by Hillcrest this year, and Kirriemuir will not be able to begin work on two projects. That is the actual effect of the Government's policies, and the aim of the debate is to make that clear to Ministers.<br><br>
What my hon. Friend the Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) said about her area is true about Angus. The Government's policy threatens Angus's unique provision of sheltered housing—(<i>Interruption.</i>] I am well aware that other hon. Members want to intervene, but I want to make progress to ensure that this is a substantial debate about housing.<br><br>
The Scottish Office predicted that local authorities would have £166 million from capital receipts available for investment, but the real figure may be as low as £88 million. Even with the supplementary allocation, Shelter has calculated that the shortfall would have been enough to build 1,200 affordable homes, or to provide heating and insulation for 25,000 council houses.<br><br>
At the start of this year, councils were already carrying the burden of a cut of 20 per cent. They made their planning and investment decisions on that basis. If the trend of the first six months continues, the actual cut for 1996–97 will be 35 per cent.—substantially more than the amount accounted for.<br><br>
The Secretary of State does not foot the bill for his own fantasy figures. The homeless and poorly housed will be made to suffer once again. Housing has consistently been used by central Government as a soft target for their cutbacks. They have cut the housing budget far more than budgets in other Departments. Indeed, the United Kingdom's record on housing investment is far worse than most of our European partners—it is the worst among the top 10 industrialised states. Average investment in housing from 1980 to 1992 was 5.8 per cent. of gross domestic product in France; 5.9 per cent. of GDP in Italy; and 5.7 per cent. of GDP in Germany. But in the UK, it was only 3.6 per cent. of GDP.<br><br>
There is no justification for that appalling lack of housing investment. Much of Scotland's housing is in a state of disrepair, which is a practical problem. Nearly one third of Scotland's housing stock—and an estimated 150,000 children—is affected by damp. More than 88,000 houses are below minimum tolerable standard levels, and the yardstick itself is an inadequate measure of housing standards because it fails to take into account disrepair or insulation standards. Housing in Scotland has an average energy rating of 3.3 out of 10 compared with 4.3 out of 10 in the UK as a whole. That is a major cause of fuel poverty which contributes to about 2,500 extra winter deaths in Scotland.<br><br>
The problem of homelessness is perhaps the most damning illustration of the Scottish housing crisis. Between 1985–86 and 1995–96, the number of applications for housing increased by 63 per cent., with a 101 per cent. rise in those accepted as homeless or potentially homeless. Homelessness remains at a level unseen prior to the 1990s. More than 41,000 homeless
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
applications were made last year, representing 75,000 people, which Shelter described as enough to fill Murrayfield stadium with 7,500 locked out. The shortage of affordable housing is underlined by the jump of more than 8,000 in council house waiting lists last year, bringing the total to a record high of about 195,000.<br><br>
Homelessness is not just a problem in the cities. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the increase in homelessness in rural areas has been much greater than in urban areas. The trend shows that there is more hidden homelessness in rural areas, with many people refraining from registering on housing waiting lists because there are so few vacancies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a local point for the hon. Gentleman and a genuine request for information. As I drove through Arbroath today, I noticed on the left hand side of the A92 that 100 to 150 houses were boarded up. They looked like fairly modern constructions. Can the hon. Gentleman give us some background to that to help us in the debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the hon. Gentleman noticed that and I compliment Angus council on forming a partnership with housing associations that are renovating the Strathairlie estate which used to be in my ward when I was the provost of Angus. That is another aspect of how Angus council has managed to overcome the problems posed by the Government rather than succumbing to them. With help from the Government, the council could have done much more.<br><br>
People in rural areas have little choice but to live in caravans or take out winter lets of holiday properties. The 1991 census reveals that 3,000 rural households were living in caravans. It is estimated that up to 1,000 people sleep rough on Scotland's streets every night, many of whom have previously been in care. Although I welcome the rough sleepers initiative, it seems that the Scottish Office may evade its responsibility even for that. Instead of forcing local authorities to compete for the limited resources in a challenge fund, thus diverting money and time in the preparation and submission of bids for funds which might not be granted, the Scottish Office should undertake a national needs assessment and provide the resources necessary to ensure that no one is forced to sleep on the streets of Scotland.<br><br>
However it is managed, the rough sleepers initiative can only ever be a sticking plaster solution to a much deeper problem which can only be resolved by long-term investment to increase the availability of decent affordable houses. The devastating cuts in the housing budget will merely serve to increase the number of people forced to live in temporary, insecure and inadequate housing, thereby exacerbating the problems of homelessness and rootlessness.<br><br>
No doubt the Secretary of State will attempt to justify the devastating cuts he has imposed by emphasising how favourably housing expenditure in Scotland fares with expenditure in England. We began to hear that argument in Question Time. However, a closer look at total housing expenditure—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trust that, in the hon. Gentleman's comments about challenge funding, he is not qualifying his views on the school in Brechin, which he and I are interested in funding through the challenge funding scheme.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0371">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
Does he know how much housing benefit is distributed to council tenants in Angus? Can he tell the Committee what the benefit would be if it were increased to cover an increase in rent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wil fight for challenge funding for Andover school in my constituency, although it should be properly funded and not need any competitive challenge funding. We are looking for scraps from the table.<br><br>
In response to the other question, I would prefer it if those council tenants were in work and earning decent wages that would enable them to run their own lives.<br><br>
Closer examination of total housing expenditure—instead of only identifiable expenditure—reveals that the Secretary of State is blowing his own trumpet without reason. Housing investment in Scotland is just as bad as housing investment south of the border. Total housing expenditure includes expenditure on housing benefit, income support for mortgage interest and mortgage interest relief at source. Using Scottish Office and Department of Social Security figures, Shelter conducted a survey comparing total housing expenditure in Scotland and England. It found that the Scottish share of identifiable expenditure was 15.1 per cent. but the Scottish share of total housing expenditure was only 9.8 per cent.—almost equal to our share of households.<br><br>
If we ignore the Government's partial look at the crude per-head-of-population figure, we discover that what we are looking at is, more or less, a level playing field. Given that the Government are introducing further cuts, Scotland may be disadvantaged over the coming years.<br><br>
If the Government cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the moral abhorrence of the Scottish housing situation, they may be persuaded by the financial reality. The Watt committee on energy estimated that adverse housing conditions are responsible for an extra £300 a household a year in general practitioner consultations, hospital and medication costs. Research conducted for the Department of the Environment, shows that the figure in England was £2 billion. In Scotland, that figure probably translates into an extra expense of £200 million. I hope that the Government wil tackle that problem.<br><br>
Housing expenditure has been dramatically cut. In 1997–98, the amount of public money available for capital investment in Scottish housing will have seen a reduction of 49 per cent. in only three years. Not for the last time today, we must scotch what the Conservatives are saying about favourable treatment for Scotland.<br><br>
I link poor quality housing to ill health. Dampness is a breeding ground for infections and allergies such as asthma and poor housing is also a major underlying cause of fuel poverty, which affects some 800,000 households in Scotland.<br><br>
The costs of homelessness and poor housing in England gave rise to £2 billion in extra costs to the health service. In Scotland that figure is probably more than £200 million, given our poorer housing conditions and harsher climate.<br><br>
Research by Greater Glasgow health board involved a survey of tenants in 300 homes, which had just been given double glazing and improved insulation. That research confirmed that the tenants saw the doctor less often in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
year after the work was carried out than in the year before. Improvements in housing, therefore, help people's health and relieve a burden from the national health service.<br><br>
Government housing investment would boost jobs in the construction industry and the manufacturing sector, which supplies building materials. It would also boost those sectors of the economy that benefit from higher consumer spending, which accompanies job security.<br><br>
According to the National Housing Forum, every £100 invested in housing creates 3,000 jobs—some 2,000 in the construction industry and 1,000 in other sectors of the economy. If there is great financial benefit in investing in Scotland's housing stock, the Government would also recoup 50 per cent. of the investment through taxes on income and reductions on social security benefits. A wise Government would listen to public opinion, but, time and again, the Government have shown that they are neither especially wise nor interested in the concerns of the Scottish people.<br><br>
However, in its Pavlovian acceptance of anything Tory, the Labour party will continue that pattern of neglect. When we last debated the housing cuts—in the Scottish Grand Committee in Hamilton—the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) acknowledged that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The cuts in the housing budget today have been staggering and unbelievable."</p></blockquote>
A little later, he continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is a desperate need, first, to improve the quality of Scottish houses and, secondly, to provide more houses."—[<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 9 December 1996; c. 31.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman made those comments, but did not at any stage make any commitment to allow those needs to be met. Before the shadow Chancellor's official endorsement of Tory policies, it was clear that Labour in government will not provide any money to restore the cuts or to address the housing crisis. At least outside the Chamber, Labour's housing spokesman—the hon. Member for Leith—was honest in his failure to endorse the campaigns by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and Shelter to increase housing investment.<br><br>
We should consider that alongside the slap in the face to local authorities delivered by the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson): the hon. Gentleman declared that there would be no seventh cavalry and no money to address the worst crisis to date. The Leader of the Opposition seems determined to practise New York-style zero tolerance policies to clear beggars from the streets. Given that, one is left with the fear that the future does not bode too well for the homeless and badly housed under any Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman remember how worthless the promises of his party were when it promised that, when it took over local councils, it would give senior citizens a £10 Christmas bonus? When it was told by the chief executive that that was not within its powers, it broke its promise to all those pensioners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As usual the hon. Gentleman has got it wrong and is making his point in exactly the wrong place. Angus council has just given two months' holiday on meals-on-wheels—they are free of charge. Lunch clubs are also free of charge. In fact, where the SNP produces extra cash through good management, it is immediately
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0372">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
turned into services for the people. Is there any Labour authority that can do that—especially one that can look forward to no extra help from the next Labour Government?<br><br>
Perhaps the hon. Member for Leith would let us know whether, instead of spouting sympathy without substance, which will do nothing to alleviate Scotland's housing crisis, he will take away the 75 per cent. debt repayment rule. Will he free that amount of cash? We are entitled to know. At least the Tories are shamelessly honest in their intention to privatise council housing. It is totally inadequate for the Labour party to declare a commitment to council and social housing while providing absolutely no resources to redress the current crisis.<br><br>
The SNP regards the right to a decent, warm, secure home as a fundamental human right. The deplorable lack of investment in housing has denied that right to many people across Scotland. We agree that the housing debt is insupportable as it stands, but it is a problem which the Government have played a large part in creating. The build-up of debt is due primarily to the Government's right-to-buy legislation. More than 300,000 houses have been sold through that means at rates substantially below market value, with the cost of discounts totalling £4 billion. That is remarkably close to the total outstanding housing debt.<br><br>
That policy has reduced the public housing stock by more than 30 per cent. since 1979, leaving local authorities with fewer rents to collect and with lost revenue, which they ought to have had to repay debts. Most of the houses sold were of the highest standard, so much of the remaining stock is in need of repair and maintenance and/or insulation, leaving councils to face disproportionate maintenance costs. I agree with council house sales, but they should have been accompanied by a building policy to ensure that there was adequate stock to meet the needs of the people.<br><br>
Left untreated, housing in disrepair will become tomorrow's below tolerable standard housing. By enforcing debt repayment at the cost of meeting housing needs, the Government merely add to the problem in the short and the longer term. Yet, by a simple technical exercise, central Government can commute that debt and bring up much-needed resources for housing investment. The Minister of State, Scottish Office, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) explained the process perfectly when writing off 40 per cent. of the water debt. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Commutation is a technical exercise. It will involve no net addition to public spending and no increase in funds available to water authorities."</p></blockquote>
By the same method, the entire debt of the English water authorities was written off prior to privatisation. If it had the same will to address the housing crisis as it had to protect the new water quangos, the Scottish Office could commute the housing debt at no additional cost to the public purse. At a stroke, that would enable local authorities to use capital receipts to invest in housing, instead of being forced to use the bulk of the money to repay debt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the hon. Gentleman's comment about the commutation of water debt pass. The difference was that the external financing limit for the new water authorities was reduced to compensate. The charge was accounted for within the Scottish Office block.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
The hon. Gentleman has not yet explained where he proposes to fund the miraculous write-off of housing debt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Common sense and straightforward write-off of housing debt. I am about to come to that. The hon. Gentleman is correct—there was no change. In other words, it was another cut in services in Scotland. Scottish National party policy goes further. We have a long-standing commitment to transfer 75 per cent. of the debt within the first term of an independent Scottish Government and the rest in the second term without reducing the allocation to local government. [HON. MEMBERS: "How?"] Hon. Members should have patience. That is what Ministers usually say, so I am saying that to the Minister.<br><br>
Transferring the debt in that way would provide local authorities with an extra £945 million to tackle housing problems and housing need over four years—about £700 million will be spent on an additional 11,200 affordable homes and 10,000 existing houses which are currently lying empty will be raised to a standard suitable for habitation with a further £250 million available to tackle the problems of dampness and repair. Would that the Government in Westminster were able to say that.<br><br>
I shall reply to the point made by the Minister. In a nation as wealthy as ours, no one should be homeless or forced to live in unfit housing. The Scottish National party is the only party to offer a housing policy with any substance. Far from the deficit being £8 billion under the Tory subsidy myth, we discover from the Government's own figures that there has been a £27 billion subsidy from Scotland to the United Kingdom since 1979.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman has found a way of doing that, I would like to know what it is, because I would like to do it if it is cost-free. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that £4 billion of housing debt in Scotland, which is £6,251 for every council house, could simply be transferred somewhere. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us to whom the £4 billion should be transferred so that we can spend it again? It sounds like a very good idea, but I am not sure that I understand how it would work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State therefore does not understand what his Government did with debt commutation and the Scottish water quangos; nor does he understand what his Government did in London. The answer to his question is independence when all the resources of Scotland will be available for all the people of Scotland. While the Secretary of State works for a pocket money solution, all he can do is to transfer money from one budget heading to another, robbing Peter to pay Paul. His pocket money solution for Scotland will always be inadequate, but during the next five years, as his Government have admitted, £12.5 billion of subsidy will head from Scotland to the United Kingdom. If even a portion of that was applied to meeting Scotland's housing problems, we could revitalise the position. I have outlined what the Scottish National party would do and it is a pity that nothing positive is on offer from any of the unionist parties.<br><br>
Although the housing cuts are among the most serious, that is not the only service feeling the strain of Government cutbacks. Throughout Scotland, services are being squeezed while council taxes rise. Scottish local government faces the most serious financial crisis in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0373">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
memory with staggering cuts of more than £350 million. That is the reality that the Secretary of State is delivering and which Labour would accept.<br><br>
Regardless of any debate on comparative expenditure, the findings of the Pieda report, which was commissioned by COSLA, highlighted the devastating impact of the Government's cuts on the Scottish economy. Because of those cuts, 17,500 jobs will be lost and £350 million will be lost from household incomes throughout Scotland. While the Government laugh, that is the reality they are imposing on our country.<br><br>
The Government have tried to divert attention from the cuts with a so-called independent study. If that was intended to be an independent study, the consultants should have been free to undertake the research as they saw fit, but they were denied the freedom to conduct primary research and they were expressly prohibited from consulting local authorities in England and Wales. Over £250,000 has been thrown away on a propaganda exercise for the Tory party.<br><br>
The Treasury has demolished the Tory myth that an independent Scotland would have a budget deficit or a general Government borrowing requirement of £8.2 billion. The figure that the Scottish Office used conveniently excluded privatisation proceeds and North sea oil revenues. We received a letter from a key Treasury economist who produces the general Government borrowing requirement figures, which confirmed that all revenues, privatisation proceeds and other royalties should be included in the calculations. It is clear that the Secretary of State abused his position to peddle political propaganda.<br><br>
The Government have admitted that Scotland is a wealthy nation which is subsidising the rest of the United Kingdom. There is, therefore, absolutely no justification for any Government—whether Labour or Tory—running Scottish local government services into the ground. One can only assume that the Government are punishing the Scottish people for not voting Tory. With regard to the Opposition spokespeople for Scotland, we are left to conclude that they lack the imagination, integrity and political will to fight for Scotland.<br><br>
Scotland's resources should be applied to all Scotland's people. However, all that the Labour party and the Tory party can offer is negative policies that force us to make cutbacks. There is a straightforward solution to the problem. If the resources of Scotland were harnessed to the needs of the people, we could get our country on the move. By investing in housing we are also investing in employment—we would give people long-term assets that would affect everyone's everyday life. We should invest in health and ensure that there is an economic kickstart to the economy.<br><br>
The Scottish National party offers a positive vision of Scotland's future. The Scots should shake their heads in despair at the negative policies that Labour and Tory Governments have introduced under the Union. Now the Scots have a positive alternative—and the sooner they exercise that alternative the better. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>

<p>11.52 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to be here in Montrose. I must thank the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), whose constituency we are in, for his courteous remarks about the difficulties associated with the E. coli outbreak in Arbroath. I am sure that all members of the Committee join me in extending my sympathies to those who have been bereaved. I must place on record the fact that the hon. Gentleman discharged his duties in a most responsible way. The outbreak team, which is currently dealing with the crisis, also provided excellent leadership.<br><br>
It is a pleasure to have been welcomed here by the provost. She referred to me as an Angus loon: I hope that she meant that in the proper sense! I am also glad that the Committee is meeting in Montrose. We heard the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) explain why he was too busy to attend this morning. Indeed, the turnout of Labour Members suggests what a Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh would be like. It would not be interested in the north-east or anything beyond the central belt.<br><br>
Having been nice about the hon. Member for Angus, East, I must pick him up on one point that he made in response to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths). He boasted about the fact that elderly people in Augus had gone for two months without being charged for their non-residential community care facilities. However, he neglected to mention that that was because the council had been charging those people too much. There was a two-month holiday because more of those elderly people were encouraged to apply for the benefits that the Government have made available to them. The council in the hon. Gentleman's constituency introduced the policy by putting out a press release saying that it was appalled by the inadequacy of the benefit system. Credit should be given when it is due—to the Secretary of State for Social Security, my right hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Mr. Lilley).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least the right hon. Gentleman got the matter half right—it is true that the council informed local people of the benefits that are available, but that did not free any money in the budget. However, it is the right hon. Gentleman's own rules which prevented the council from spending that money next year. Through prudent management, it made that cash available immediately in services for the people. The right hon. Gentleman should be congratulating Augus, not making a spurious attack.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give Augus a windfall this morning if it holds the same view as the hon. Gentleman—that it could not spend the money next year. That is not the case. The hon. Gentleman is wrong. His speech was predictable and somewhat lengthy. He repeated the claims that were made by Opposition Members, before they were silenced by the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown), that Scottish local government is underfunded and that next year's settlement requires councils to cut their expenditure. Northing could be further from the truth. On both counts those claims are groundless. Contrary to the talk of cuts, next year's settlement allows every council to increase expenditure compared with the current year.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0374">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
Overall, the settlement provides for an increase of £132 million or a 2.2 per cent. increase in expenditure. That is before any account is taken of efficiency savings. The level of Government support has increased by more than £60 million. Overall, local government was treated favourably in last year's public expenditure survey and I challenge any hon. Member claims that the settlement is inadequate to tell the Committee which other Scottish Office programmes could be cut to give more to local government. The truth is that more for local government can only be at the expense of other Scottish spending programmes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is very brave.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted clarification, in the light of what the Minister said, of the debt redemption rules. Given the restrictions on capital borrowing for local authorities in the reduction of debt levels as a result of principal repayments exceeding additional borrowing consents, would the Secretary of State explain why it is necessary further to reduce levels of housing investment by increasing the percentage of receipts to be applied to debt repayment from 25 per cent. to 75 per cent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because if either local authorities or Scottish Homes continue to borrow on property that is then disposed of and to use the receipts to buy more property and to borrow more, the assets will eventually exceed the borrowing liability. That is the way to Carey street. That is what happened with Scottish Homes and we had to make provision for it.<br><br>
The extent to which next year's entitlement has been completely misrepresented is well illustrated by the situation in Montrose. Angus council claims that it needs to cut its expenditure by £15 million. If that were true, it would be a very serious matter, but the truth is that, far from having to cut its expenditure, next year it can spend £3.7 million or 3.3 per cent. more than its budget for the current year. What Angus is really saying is that it would like to increase its expenditure next year, not by £3.7 million but by nearly £19 million—an increase of more than 17 per cent. on this year's current budget. If there were no capping controls, it would mean adding no less than 79 per cent. to the council tax. It is extraordinary that any council, especially one that claims that it is prudent in its financial affairs, would seriously contemplate an increase of 17 per cent. in expenditure and 79 per cent. in the council tax. The truth is that Angus, in common with the rest of Scottish local government, is simply scaremongering when it talks of cuts, which is deplorable behaviour and completely irresponsible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should look at his own base figure. When it was aggregated with the previous region, he gave Angus a shortfall of £9 million and distributed it elsewhere. Had that money, which according to the Minister's figures was due to Angus, been given to it, it could have contemplated the lowest council tax in Scotland. Angus has a low level of council tax. If it were given the money, that prudent authority would turn it into services for the people.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that the mis-match scheme is self-financing and that Angus has gained from it. I am not sure what point he is making.<br><br>
The reaction of Scottish local government to this year's settlement is not new. Every year, there is the constant cry that local government spending is being cut and that Scottish councils are being starved of funds. Those claims have always been nonsense and now we have the evidence to prove it. The report of the Local Authority Current Expenditure Study, which was published on Friday and sent to all members of the Committee, is a major and important piece of work. The study was carried out entirely independently of Government by Coopers and Lybrand and Pieda, which hon. Members have been keen to represent in the past when the arguments suited them. After going to great lengths to ensure that they compared like with like, they concluded that across a wide range of services, spending levels are higher than in either England or in Wales and in some cases very much higher. For example, spending on education is 23 per cent. higher than in England, on social work the excess is more than 16 per cent. Spending on roads and transport is 42 per cent. higher than in England and nearly 38 per cent. higher than in Wales. Spending on fire and civil defence is 15 per cent. higher than in England and 20 per cent. higher than in Wales. Spending on environmental services is 39 per cent. higher than in England and 20 per cent. higher than in Wales.<br><br>
Those are all large excesses, but when it falls more into the discretionary category, Scottish local authority spending really goes through the roof. For example, leisure and recreation spending is no less than 85 per cent. higher than in England and 30 per cent. higher than in Wales. Planning and economic development spending is nearly 77 per cent. higher than in England and 42 per cent. higher than in Wales.</span></p>
<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>I defy any Opposition member of the Committee to tell me what is so particular about Scotland that it requires us to spend 77 per cent. more on planning officials and planners. The consultants could find no credible explanation and it shows the opportunity for directing resources where—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given way to the hon. Gentleman already. In short, the report completely and utterly refutes</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How much was Coopers and Lybrand paid for this?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In short, the report utterly refutes the myth that Scottish local Government is underfunded. But, in addition, the consultants question the extent to which issues such as sparsity, deprivation and unemployment are, as is often claimed by Opposition parties and by local government, a significant factor in justifying the higher levels of expenditure in Scotland. Indeed, the consultants comment on the fact that policy choice by councils can often be an important factor in explaining the higher

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
levels of expenditure in Scotland. The study, which was published on Friday, has always been seen as the first stage of the process. Conservatives members of the Committee are committed—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. I am about to make a challenge to which the hon. Gentleman respond. Conservative members of the Committee are committed to a second-stage study. The main objective of the second stage would be, for example, to get behind the figures that have now been published to explore further the reasons for higher spending by Scottish councils and to consider the relative efficiency of Scottish councils and the quality of service that they deliver—in short, to find out what we are getting for our money from such huge expenditure.<br><br>
We regard the second stage as essential and I challenge the Labour party and the minority parties, which have no prospect of forming the next Government—they have that in common with the Labour party—to say that they would also endorse a second-stage study. If they do not give a firm commitment to do so, it will be clear that they are not prepared to have these excesses fully investigated. In any discussion of the funding of a Scottish Parliament, the Higher levels of local government expenditure in Scotland would have to be addressed. Without further investigation of the kind that I believe is necessary, those arguing for constitutional change will be putting at risk the delivery of essential services by local authorities in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our prospects in Scotland are rather better than the Secretary of State's, as he will see from the polls in this morning's papers.<br><br>
The Secretary of State spent £200,000 on this propaganda exercise—a matter that the hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about earlier—and £800,000 on the nursery voucher propaganda exercise. RAF aeroplanes were commissioned to fly him to London and civil servants used to answer political questionnaires from the Confederation of British Industry. When can we expect the Secretary of State to fund his own propaganda and travel arrangements, instead of raiding the public purse?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that people will draw their own conclusions about how seriously to take the hon. Gentleman. We are discussing how we spend £5.3 billion and the hon. Gentleman is objecting to our spending nearly £1 billion in getting a cross a message to every parent in Scotland with children under school age that they can have a tax-free voucher worth £1,100 to spend on nursery education. Local government is not telling them how to spend it, or that there is no place for their child because they are not unemployed or that particular parents will be discriminated against—they are being told that they can provide the education for their children that they wish. The real issue is that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) and his colleagues do not want people to have that choice and if the Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
are not returned after the general election, it will be snatched out of people's hands. The Opposition parties
are the voucher-snatchers in Scottish politics and they are desperate to prevent the people of Scotland finding out what is on offer for them.<br><br>
My hon. Friend, the Minister for Local Government and I have had meetings with several hon. Members and delegations from councils in the past few weeks about next year's settlement. I am not prepared to increase the level of funding for Scottish local government as a whole. I cannot find any more money for Scottish local government unless it is taken from the budgets for Scotland's health service and other caring services—I am not prepared to do that. My position on that is common to that of the official Opposition.<br><br>
However, amongst all the scaremongering, several points were made at those meetings that had merit. I referred to the right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir David Steel) in that regard. As a result, I have two changes to next year's settlement to announce. The first, relates to next year's capping regime, I announced my provisional capping principles to the House on Budget day last November; in the main, councils were permitted to increase their capped expenditure by 0.5 per cent. Some expenditure areas are outwith capping and councils are able to increase next year's expenditure by, on average, around 2 per cent. However, several relatively low-spending councils have argued that it is unfair that they should be permitted only the same year-on-year increase in capped expenditure as high-spending councils. I have concluded that there is some merit in that point, notwithstanding the fact that relaxation of the capping regime would result in higher council tax levels in the areas concerned. However, the councils, such as Scottish Borders and Angus that have argued for an increase in their capping limit, have acknowledged that the additional cost would inevitably have to fall on their council tax payers, to whom they are accountable. The councils have indicated that they fully accept that.<br><br>
Against that background, I have decided to revise my provisional capping principles for next year. Instead of all councils being permitted a 0.5 per cent. increase in their capped expenditure, I shall introduce a tapered system. Fifteen Scottish councils will benefit from that change including Angus and Scottish Borders. I hope that the councils will apply that additional spending power for frontline services. The other councils concerned are Dumfries and Galloway, East Ayrshire, East Dumbartonshire, East Lothian, Falkirk, Highland, Moray, North Ayrshire, Orkney Islands, Perth and Kinross, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire and Stirling. I am sure that hon. Members will welcome that change.<br><br>
As I said, that change in capping limits will push up council tax levels and what is known as local authority self-finance expenditure by as much as £10 million. That increase in public expenditure can be afforded only by making offsetting reductions in other expenditure programmes; I intend to reduce the level of local authority capital consents for next year by £10 million so that overall there is no increase in the level of funding for Scottish local government.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0376">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks, "What?" We cannot increase expenditure without taking it from another pocket—in this case, local authorities' capital consents, which are generally given—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has there not been a 3.5 per cent. increase this year in South Ayrshire's aggregated external finance? On that basis, surely there should be no need for the increases in council tax that the lifting of capping might involve?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If all the authorities were Conservative-controlled, we would have council tax reductions and improvements in services, but we must wait for the electorate to give their verdict in South Ayrshire and elsewhere for that to happen.<br><br>
My second announcement concerns what has become known as the spend-to-save scheme. I know the difficulties that authorities face in adjusting their existing spending patterns to what can be afforded, while protecting the front-line services to which we all attach priority. When I last met the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, it asked whether it could have more flexibility within the total resources available to it, to allow authorities to use some of their capital provision to secure savings on their revenue budgets—the spend-to-save scheme. I have examined that proposal carefully and I and my hon. Friend—I hope he will soon be a right hon.—the Under Secretary, the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) will do what we can to increase councils' flexibility in that regard. No new resources are available for that purpose, but I shall allow authorities to use some of the resources available for capital expenditure to secure reductions in revenue spending. I am, therefore, prepared to make arrangements for authorities to trade in some of their capital provision, to be converted into special revenue grants to help fund staff reductions or other spend-to-save measures. Several authorities have expressed an interest in doing that and my Department will have discussions with them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Steel <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that announcement. However, he will understand that we want to examine the small print of the precise calculations. I suspect that the proposal will not amount to much, but at least he has considered the point.<br><br>
On another point, which affects the local authority budgets, when does the Secretary of State intend to introduce the amended teachers' superannuation regulations, because that will reduce employers contributions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to write to the right hon. Gentleman about that, because we have been consulting on it and I cannot give him the precise answer today. I am sorry that he did not give the measure more of a welcome. I know that we are close to a general election—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale has the advantage of not seeking re-election; his hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) must be careful about giving credit to the Government. Before the hon. Gentleman rises, I must tell him that the measure will enable Borders to increase its expenditure by £924,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that small consideration. I recognise that the Secretary of State has done much personal work on that and given some welcome succour to the other 15 councils, even if he could not find a unique solution for the Borders. However, difficult decisions will still have to be taken in bodies such as the Scottish Borders council, particularly since he has found no extra funding. I give his announcement this morning two cheers—it would have been three if he had found a little extra money to fund it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would have meant another reduction in the available capital resources. Borders will be able to increase its expenditure by £3 million. Both the right hon. Gentleman and hon. Gentleman said that every little helps, but council tax payers, whose incomes have not gone up by more than the rate of inflation, will think that those are substantial sums.<br><br>
On housing finance, we have heard the usual clarion call for more public resources, but where would the resources come from to enable the higher level of investment? The hon. Member for Angus, East did not answer that question. It was all very interesting. He would write off the debts, but he was not prepared to tell us where the money would come from. I had the impression that the bill would be sent to England, after Scottish independence—that cheque may bounce.<br><br>
Our record on housing is second to none. In the past five years, the Government have enabled Scottish local authorities to invest £2 billion in local authority housing stock while Scottish Homes has invested £1,800 million, attracting £830 million of private-sector investment in doing so.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Angus, East boasted that, in Angus, the value of the stock exceeded the debts. That means that by transferring the stock to other landlords, housing associations and so on, resources can be released to improve housing. It is sheer dogma that prevents the hon. Gentleman looking after the interests of tenants in Angus and district.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says rubbish, but it is a fact that local authorities can increase investment by transferring housing to landlords that operate in the independent rented sector. Tenants who transferred would receive a rent guarantee for the first five years after transfer—a guarantee which would genuinely ensure that rent increases were no more than 1 to 2 per cent. above the rate of inflation. For instance, housing association rents in Berwickshire are limited to RPI plus 1.5 per cent. That is a good deal compared to average rent increases that most local authority tenants have had to face—more than 9 per cent. last year, and a further substantial increase in the current year.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0377">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
The hon. Member for Angus, East rightly said that housing was important. As a proportion of housing stock, public sector housing has fallen from more than 50 per cent. in 1979 to less than a third, and owner-occupation has risen from 35 to almost 60 per cent. I am proud of that record. The Conservative Government have given the opportunities of ownership to people throughout Scotland—opportunities which would have been denied by the Opposition, who oppose the sale of council houses. The Government have thereby given families who never had a chance of owning capital the chance of owning something that can be passed on to their children.<br><br>
I cannot let the opportunity of being in Montrose pass without speaking about another initiative relevant to local government—the small towns initiative—especially as Montrose will be included in the first wave of small towns. Small towns have a massive contribution to make to Scottish culture. We must ensure that they have an important future as thriving communities.<br><br>
Scottish Enterprise was asked to bring forward a small towns initiative to provide additional and focused assistance to boost local businesses and enhance the environment of small towns in Scotland. Most important was the aim of engaging the imagination and commitment of the communities themselves.<br><br>
I am pleased to say that Scottish Enterprise and its network of local enterprise companies has made rapid progress. Scottish Enterprise Tayside has selected the towns of Montrose and Brechin, whose joint population is less than 30,000. Expenditure of more than £2 million is planned on a range of measures, including environmental works in both towns and site preparation. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is no longer in the room, but he would like to know that Scottish Borders Enterprise has selected Hawick to be the subject of various improvements. Forth Valley Enterprise has selected Alloa.<br><br>
Once the initial selection of towns has been made, and once the programme of works has begun, it will be for Scottish Enterprise to consider extending the initiative to other towns and other local enterprise company areas. To be successful, an initiative of that sort must engage the support of the local community. I believe that the communities of all the small towns so far selected are waiting for the opportunity to participate fully in the regeneration of their towns. It will be for local enterprise companies and their partner organisations to provide communities with that opportunity—and the leadership to exploit it.<br><br>
Leadership is essential. The pressures of business costs, out-of-town shopping and so on are having a dramatic effect on wee shops and in high streets across Scotland. Urgent action is needed at every level, and the Scottish Office will work in partnership with the local authorities to achieve it.<br><br>
Finally, following representations made by Angus council about the scale of the preparatory costs for the council's project to upgrade the A92 between Dundee and Arbroath, I have decided exceptionally, as part of the 1998–99 challenge fund competition, to award another £1 million towards preparatory costs for the council's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
private finance initiative project. Together with the £1 million already awarded, it means that Angus will now receive £2 million on top of its annual block allocation.<br><br>
Unlike the hon. Member for Angus, East, with his totally unrealistic proposals, I have described a number of measures that will assist the provision of key local services. I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>12.20 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I send our condolences to the bereaved in the Arbroath area, and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who are still ill.<br><br>
The next Government will inherit from the present Government a disastrous legacy in many areas, three of which are relevant to today's debate. First, according to the Government, there will be a public sector borrowing requirement of £26 billion. If the experience of 1992 is anything to go by, it may well be much bigger than that. That will be an inevitable constraint on anything that we can do for housing and local government.<br><br>
We will inherit cuts of 35 per cent. in council housing, on top of 20 per cent. cuts this year, which will devastate modernisation programmes. There will be a cut in the Scottish Homes budget of 25 per cent., on top of a cut of 13 per cent. this year, which will devastate the new build programme.<br><br>
In local govnerment, we are in the second year of massive cuts and a real cut in Government grants—notwithstanding the repetition of the fiction and fiddles to which we have become used to receiving from the Conservative party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given what the hon. Gentleman just said, will he tell us whether a future Labour Government would keep the 75 per cent. debt repayment rule, reduce it to 50 or 25 per cent. or abolish it altogether?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with the 75 per cent. rule later, so, if the Under-Secretary of State can contain himself, I shall continue.<br><br>
The underlying reason for that disastrous legacy is 18 years of low-growth, boom-bust instability and economic failure. The Scottish people understand full well that it is not possible to undo 18 years of economic failure in 18 months, and they will not take kindly to anyone who makes easy promises and suggests otherwise. That brings me to the Scottish National party. The SNP scatters spending pledges like confetti, but it never bothers to tell how much they will cost. For example, the £1.4 billion that it proposes to add to local authority expenditure was not mentioned this morning. That was not mentioned because people could calculate that that would put between 8p and 9p on income tax—or the equivalent amount on other taxes.<br><br>
Transferred housing debt was mentioned—local authority housing debt amounts to £4.387 billion. It was suggested that that would somehow disappear if transferred to the Government of an independent Scotland. Of course, that is a joke in line with the joke economics of the SNP. That debt would have to be

serviced by the Government of an independent Scotland, which would mean more than 3p on the income tax of an independent Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Welsh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the hon. Gentleman asks the Minister of State, Scottish Office, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) for a simple explanation of how the Government commuted the water board debt. That was a paper transaction within central Government. We have explained the matter in detail, but the hon. Gentleman has clearly not done his homework. Let him read the detail of the SNP policy; we are concerned with pounds and pence, which is party is not yet prepared to address.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman does not understand economics or public finance, I do not have time to explain them to him now.<br><br>
The SNP never explains to us the massive cost of tearing Scotland out of the United Kingdom. It never tells us about the transaction costs of an independent currency and the continuing dependence on English interest rates. It never tells us about the prolonged uncertainty and massive administration costs of unpicking the social security and tax system. It never tells us about the cost of separate embassies and an army, air force and navy, which is calculated as equivalent to 3p on income tax, plus conscription and 20,000 job losses in the defence industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am finding the hon. Gentleman's speech very interesting, but we are not discussing defence estimates in Scotland or elsewhere; this is a housing debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will return immediately to the subject of housing.<br><br>
SNP Members are the charlatans of Scottish politics; they magic away debt at the stroke of a pen and conjure massive surpluses by the loading of one parliamentary question. The politics of the SNP are the politics of the never-never. SNP Members can promise the earth because they know that they will never be elected and will never have to deliver.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, time is very short and if my hon. Friend will forgive me, I want to move on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is panicked by this morning's opinion poll, or perhaps he was sacred when he was virtually chased out of the tenants' meeting that we both attended a week ago last Friday. Does he remember that the first person to suggest the commutation of capital debt in Scotland's housing stock was Sir Robert Grieve in his analysis of the position in Glasgow 10 years ago? Would the hon. Gentleman concede that the late Sir Robert Grieve knew more about the housing position than either him or the Secretary of State for Scotland? That suggestion provided very firm support for the policy.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course housing debt can be commuted. All I am saying is that the SNP must be honest and put the price tag on it. Commuting housing debt would not help anyone in the housing association sector.<br><br>
I turn now to the only party that could be a threat to the Union—the party that confuses unionism with a unitary state and is so ignorant of Scottish and English history that it seems to think that we have had a unitary British state for 1,000 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman moves off the subject of funding, I should point out that he criticised the Government for imposing cuts on local authorities. The Labour party has said that expenditure in the future will be static. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm Labour's commitment to a Scottish Assembly, which would cost some £500 million to introduce? Will he explain how a Labour Government would fund that without totally damaging local authority expenditure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is just more scaremongering rubbish. I will come to the subject of the Scottish Parliament later on.<br><br>
What is the Conservative party's defence for the massive cuts to expenditure on local government and housing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do so in a minute, but I have been told that I may speak for 15 minutes, which, considering how wide the debate is, is very difficult.<br><br>
What were repeated today were the fiction and fiddles that we have got used to hearing from the Government when they explain the local government settlement. Obviously we have not had time to consider today's announcements in great detail, but it seems that some councils are to get help at the expense of others. We will consider that, but it does not seem to amount to much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I want to give him an illustration of what he has just been saying about the hypocrisy of the SNP. Catherine Taylor, our Labour party candidate, has introduced me to Frank Wood, who is chairman of Age Concern Montrose. The council, which is made up largely of SNP councillors, has when pushed, harmed elderly people in the area by reducing the scope and extent of the concessionary fare scheme. That is the kind of priority that the Scottish National Party has—when it is under pressure, it puts old people under pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that point.<br><br>
Local government finance is notoriously complicated, so I shall make two simple points. The first trick that the Government indulge in is to pretend that local government reorganisation next year will save £60 million relative to this year—no one who has studied the subject would do that. To every figure that the Secretary of State gave today, he added that imaginary £60 million. That is the only way he achieves increases in Government grants; the cash cut in Government grants to local authorities is £25 million.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0379">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
There is another way of comparing next year's grant with this year's. One can add the £25 million cut or take account of old burdens and new burdens. The disappearing old burdens include £26 million for nursery vouchers, to which we will add savings of £10 million on local government reorganisation, giving £36 million. That is far outweighed by the new burdens that even the Scottish Office admits amount to £90 million. If one uses that method of comparison, there is still a cut, which is in fact greater than £25 million. The Government are indulging in fantasy economics—like the SNP—and fiddling the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to get into that particular argument, but if the hon. Gentleman is saying that what the Government are doing is inadequate for local government, why will not he pledge a single £1 more for Scottish local government? Is not it outrageous that he should attack us for what we have done, when if he were in government, he would give not £1 more? How does he justify that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State's party has been in government for 18 years. As I said earlier, nobody expects 18 years to be undone in 18 months. We will take many actions in the first 18 months, but there is no way that the ills of 18 years can suddenly be wiped clean in that time. The people of Scotland will not believe any party that says otherwise, which is why they will not believe the easy promises of the SNP.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am again grateful for the hon. Gentleman's courtesy. If he will not say how much he will give now, how much extra does he believe he would want to give to local government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just coming to that. The second defence that was used by the Secretary of State was the report, about which many things could be—and have been—said. Clearly, there are many factors behind it and we accept the need for further study, particularly on the issue of quality. We are especially concerned about the quality of local government services.<br><br>
Two questions must be put to the Secretary of State. First, if he thinks that too much is spent on local services in Scotland, will he—as he must—spell out what services he wants to be slashed on top of the cuts that he is already imposing on Scottish local authorities? Secondly, if he wants to use the report as part of his scaremongering about a Scottish Parliament, how can the Barnett formula, which the Secretary of State and his great mentor, Baroness Thatcher, defended for years, be right under the Scottish office but not under a Scottish Parliament? When we have set up the Scottish Parliament, will he be in Parliament—if he should still be there—arguing for a cut in the grant to such a Scottish Parliament? Perhaps he will stand up and tell us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Barnett formula reduces the advantage that Scotland has over England. It says that we receive our share, relative to population, of any increase in England. It is the baseline that is around a third higher.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
In arguing for the Barnett formula, the hon. Gentleman is doing the Treasury's job for it. He is certainly not arguing the case for Scotland.<br><br>
One of the interesting things that the study shows is that expenditure on primary schools in Scotland is not very much higher than in England—the extra expenditure is in secondary schools. Why should that be? We want more money to go into primary schools and into classrooms for youngsters. That is one of the changes that I would like to see made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that secondary schools have been mentioned. Labour has flagged the early years as crucial for education—that is why one of our early pledges is for early-years classes of below 30, as well as the scrapping of the bureaucratic and wasteful nursery vouchers system. The Secretary of State therefore makes my point for me.<br><br>
Housing is one of the many areas that will benefit from the creation of a Scottish Parliament. Can anyone believe that if we had had a Scottish Parliament for the past 18 years, we would have seen the vendetta against council housing which the Government have waged? A Scottish Parliament will mean that housing goes higher up the political agenda, partly because it will receive more time—a special committee will be devoted to housing affairs. Scottish housing hardly gets a look-in in the Westminster Parliament.<br><br>
Our housing policy addresses many housing issues, including housing benefit. I want to consider the effect that the 75 per cent. rule will have on housing benefit. As a result of that rule, many councils are putting up rents to fill the investment gap. The Government never considered the cost of housing benefit and the effect of their cuts in the housing budget on the housing benefit bill. We will address that issue very carefully. Another aspect of housing benefit that we will examine is housing benefit fraud, where, according to the Select Committee on Social Security, £2 billion is being lost.<br><br>
We shall put in as much public money as we can, and we will spend more wisely the money that is already there. For example, we will cut down on the bureacracy in the relationship between Scottish Homes and housing associations. We will see whether money can be saved by consortium borrowing by housing associations. But however much public money is put in, additional investment through new housing partnerships will be needed. That is why we must be imaginative in the ways in which we try to get new money into housing. We fully support new housing partnerships where tenants are closely involved. That method builds on the tradition of the community-based housing associations and co-ops of which we in Scotland are so proud.<br><br>
The Government talk about private money as a cover for cuts and a vehicle for privatisation. We are talking about new housing partnerships as a way of attracting additional investment into housing in a democratic way. We could call it democratically controlled housing or non-profit housing for rent. Some of our enemies try to present that as a vehicle for privatisation; for us, it is the exact opposite. We believe in a central role for tenants: there will be no transfer of council houses without tenants' consent and they will be centrally involved in any new partnership. The Government have ruled out tenant majorities in any new housing partnership, but we are open to that possibility if it is what local people want.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
Owing to the great backlog in repairs, we propose to use some of the money from the environmental task force—which we shall set up using the windfall tax on the fat cat profits of the gas, electricity and water industries—for the much-needed repairs in Scottish housing. There are many strands to our housing policy. The ills of Scottish housing cannot be righted in 18 months, but we will treat housing as a priority as soon as we are elected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My time is up, so I cannot take any more interventions.<br><br>
We have had a wide-ranging debate covering housing, local government and the constitution. To highlight the difference between us and the Conservative party, I should say that we shall target youth unemployment and involve the environmental task force and other initiatives to deal with it. We shall introduce a minimum wage, set up a Scottish Parliament, give a new priority to health and housing and made the connections between the two. The people of Scotland realise that that cannot be done quickly, but they will put their confidence in us rather than in the Scottish National party, whose easy promises they will never believe. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Shouting from the public gallery is not allowed. It will only cause difficulties for me and for the Committee. I would appreciate it if it was not done.</span></p>
<p>12.37 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because of the time constraint, I shall do my best to be brief.<br><br>
The debate is timely. I want to address, first, the housing issues which are of real concern. The reality is that, under the Government, so much damage has been done to the housing sector that I must, to an extent, agree with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leigh (Mr. Chisholm) that it cannot be reversed overnight. Equally, it cannot continue. One of the most offensive aspects of Government policy is the way that they have targeted the most vulnerable people on the housing list in the squeeze that they have imposed. Homelessness has increased and in increasing, so much so that the Government have admitted that they require a rough sleepers initiative. However, most of us want to ensure that no one is sleeping rough, or has to sleep rough, and that facilities are provided.<br><br>
Many young people are sleeping rough as a direct consequence of Government policy, which is based on a moralistic judgement that takes no account of fundamental reality. The implication is that young rough sleepers should go home to their parents, without any acknowledgement of why they left in the first place—they may have been abused, thrown out or dragged into criminal activities.<br><br>
There are all sorts of reasons why young people have been driven out. In such circumstances, simply to say that they will receive no benefit and must find someone to support them is hopelessly unrealistic and unjust. It creates a great deal of hardship and poverty and, for many such people, shatters their lives before they have properly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
begun. We cannot allow that to continue. We want priority to be given to the reinstatement of full benefit for all those under 25, especially 16 and 17-year-olds. The Government can no longer defend the removal of benefits from such people.<br><br>
The second problem is that waiting lists are increasing in length. Before Minister come back on that point, I accept that waiting lists are not in themselves an objective measure of need, but the scale of the increases and the practical difficulties faced by every local authority in the country are a fair source of information and they tell us that there is a growing problem. It exists in the north-east of Scotland, where we have a rapidly expanding population, high prices for private accommodation and a shortage of affordable accommodation—the situation is getting worse year by year.<br><br>
I took the trouble—by way of illustration—to ascertain from Aberdeenshire council how it saw the situation. It told me that between 1,400 and 1,700 affordable houses were required across the authority area annually. There is, however, no possibility of those being provided using existing resources. The council expressed concern about the growing number of young and elderly people who present themselves as homeless. The number of homeless is, however, relatively small; the numbers of hidden homeless and the pressure that they put on authorities are the real causes of concern.<br><br>
The Government will say that they have done much to expand private ownership and that ever more people live in their own homes. That is true, and the statistics bear out the fact that private ownership has expanded. In a sense, however—particularly in high-cost areas—that only increases the problem for people who cannot afford to buy. Such people do not have a high enough or secure enough incomes to get a mortgage or do not want to do so because their income is uncertain. Such people need affordable housing.<br><br>
Local authorities in the north-east have not had a problem with ideological bias and have been prepared to explore any possible initiative, including work with housing associations, the promotion of partnerships and co-operation with the rent-to-mortgage scheme. We are, however, still nowhere near meeting the need. The Government have failed miserably to recognise that their housing policies need a fundamental review, which I hope and believe will come soon.<br><br>
We need to tackle the issue of people who are genuinely on the waiting list, but making no progress. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) must see cases similar to those that I encounter in my surgery every week. I meet people with genuine difficulties who are on long waiting lists; they live in extreme hardship and overcrowding and experience social pressures. Most people can bear such problems in the short term if they know that there is a limit to them; when they go on without end, however, they become intolerable. Indeed the situation is sometimes aggravated because households split up. Initially, one applicant may be living with someone, but ultimately three households may be looking for accommodation—that only increases the pressure.<br><br>
The other issue that we need to tackle is repairs. I was interested to note that, although the quality of housing in Aberdeenshire is high, a programme to deal with improvements to windows, heating and fabric is running
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0381">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
behind needs because of current circumstances. The council has responded constructively to the problem by taking advantage of many of the initiatives that have become available through co-operation with Government and other agencies. It has altered its method of debt financing to take advantage of the annuity method, which has the benefit of transferring into capital only in the short term. That is, of course, a live-now-pay-later scheme and will ultimately end. If there is no top-up, difficulties could arise in future. The council is implementing its measures in the context of modest increases in council house rents—rents have increased by slightly more than inflation, but not by as much as might have been feared.<br><br>
The final policy area that we need to discuss—the Government must recognise that they have instituted this—is the phasing out of mortgage interest relief in favour of a mortgage benefit to target the present substantial investment on people who are most in need. The Government claim to be in favour of home ownership, and such a switch would help people at the bottom of the scale to make the transition from rent to mortgage by targeting the benefit, rather than spreading it across the board. Liberal Democrats believe that that should happen given that the immediate problem of the private sector housing crisis of the past few years has not evaporated, although it has diminished substantially.<br><br>
I want to deal now with some of the Secretary of State's comments on local government finance in general. I seek an assurance from him or from the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside. Councils such as Aberdeenshire have not applied for the capping to be lifted because they are trying to keep council tax within acceptable limits. They should not, therefore, be penalised by having adverse cuts made in their capital consents. I heard alarm bells ring when the Secretary of State said that the £10 million that had to be released for the raising or variation of the capping limit would be financed by cuts in capital consent. I hope that he will not penalise an authority that has not applied because it is trying to keep the council tax down, and suggest financing that out of its capital consents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just explain why Aberdeenshire did not appear on the list of authorities mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State? Capping rules do not apply to Aberdeenshire, which is affected instead by grant-aided expenditure. Aberdeenshire already enjoys an expenditure increase this year of 3.36 per cent.—one of the largest in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's intervention, which clarifies the situation. However, my point is that Aberdeenshire will not complain that it is not on that list, but would complain if it suffered a cut in its capital consent because of this concession. That would effectively undermine a position for which it is currently planning. As long as Aberdeenshire's situation is not unexpectedly made worse at this late stage, I have no doubt that it will confront its budget as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the allocation of the reduction in capital to fund this relaxation of capping, is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the £10 million be deducted purely from those who have benefited? Is he suggesting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
that a greater reduction be applied to the area in the Borders represented by his hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), for example, so that his authority suffers no detrimental effect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows exactly what concern I am expressing. As of today, councillors from Aberdeenshire and other councils are working on a budget and the grant-aided expenditure provision which assume certain capital consents and grant-aided expenditure. A sudden reduction will add a dimension of difficulty to their budget that they have not anticipated and which I think they will regard as a little unfair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should have made it clear that it is the in-year supplementary capital allocations that the money would be taken from out of the total resources that are made available for local government, so there is no additional cost. The hon. Gentleman is either suggesting, as my hon. Friend mentioned, that local authorities such as Borders and Angus should have their capital allocation reduced, or that it is top sliced, or that it should come from the health service. Could he be absolutely precise? He is making a complaint, so could he say what he is proposing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not yet making a complaint, but I think that I probably should be. I am simply expressing a concern as to how the matter will be decided. Local authorities are now being told that there might be a reduction. The Secretary of State has just clarified that this will not come straight out of their capital allocations. That clarification is helpful, and significantly alters the position. But when budgeting is so difficult and tight, if local authorities that are close to the budget calculation are told that some expected capital consent will not be available, that will present difficulties.<br><br>
My second point is a plea that councils of north-east Scotland make consistently. We experience dramatic population growth and generally speaking, our capital consents are already creating difficulties. How will the Secretary of State determine what is a fair allocation? Is it across the board or will it simply come out of a contingency fund, so that the fallout will not be known until later in the year?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not have contingency funds lying around that we can raid. I would not want to mislead the Committee. The money comes out of the capital allocations to local authorities. On the in-year figure there is generally an underspend, and we make supplementary capital allocations. The hon. Gentleman should be in no doubt that the £10 million will come out of the capital that would otherwise be available. It is being top sliced, so all authorities have to pay for it. The authorities that are paying are, in the main, those whose expenditure levels are above their GAE.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made his point in respect of Aberdeenshire. There is no way in which we can allow increases in local authority expenditure that do not have consequences elsewhere in the block or, in this case, to the available resources for local Government as a whole. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the authorities which benefit should have their allocations reduced, or that the money should come from the health service and other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0382">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
parts of the block, or does he agree with the Government? It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would say what his position is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification, but after several interventions I am not sure whether or not I am wiser than I was. As they tend to do, the Government have announced a change very late in the day. That change has knock-on implications, which I am trying to highlight.<br><br>
I am not entirely convinced that savings of that order may not be secured within the Scottish Office block. It is interesting that it is all right for the Government to overrun or to find additional money for unexpected contingencies, but it is somehow irresponsible of local authorities when they complain about the difficulty of meeting their budgets. A certain subjective difference of judgment is at work there.<br><br>
I notice that the consultants, as such people always do, have had one bite of the cherry and have put in a bid for the other half. That is a substantial amount of money which I accept may yet inform the debate, but what the Secretary of State said this morning will cause alarm bells to ring with many people. He has only half the information but is already making secondary conclusions and lambasting local authorities. He makes no distinction between them, and accepts no value judgments about the reasons involved.<br><br>
I do not deny that some interesting and relevant benefit may arise from the study. In the context of education, for example, the report makes it clear that the secondary pupil-teacher ratio in Scotland is 12:1, substantially lower than the England and Wales figure of 16. If the Secretary of State asserts that Scotland only has to be at the England and Wales level, he is implying a massive change to the structure of education in Scotland. That would have enormous repercussions and Scottish people would want to know the implications. It is the Secretary of State's job to defend the Scottish education system, or is he going to drag it down to a level comparable to that obtaining south of border, where there are problems due to inadequacy of funding?<br><br>
The study contains all sorts of gaps, such as giving comparisons between some local authorities with regard to some services but not others. I do not wish to dwell on special pleading, but I note that Grampian's per capita spending on fire and police is lower than the English and Welsh average. There are significant variations in Scotland, and I hope that the Secretary of State will take that into account when he gets the complete study.<br><br>
It is not a matter of one region against another. If there are differentials, we need to know why they arise. Are they a result of perceived need or extravagance? There should be a partnership between central Government and local government. That would enable the problems to be identified and dealt with constructively. Where need is assessed, such a partnership would ensure that it was properly funded and supported.<br><br>
It is a sterile argument for the Government to state that they are not cutting local authorities' budgets but instead increasing their funding. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) has said that most people can understand that a 2.2 per cent. cash increase inevitably creates problems when inflation is at about 3.5 per cent. In addition, salary settlements must be absorbed and there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
are additional commitments: the Government want extra spending on fire, police, care in the community and on the provisions of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.<br><br>
To meet such commitments obviously requires cuts elsewhere. The Government talk blithely about efficiency savings, but that usually means cuts—job losses and fewer people doing the same or additional work. It is nonsense to suggest otherwise. Most local authorities are extremely responsible in the way that they seek such efficiency savings, but there are limits.<br><br>
When we arrived here this morning, there was a small local demonstration by the parents of Laurencekirk school. They were promised a new primary school, but it has not been built because Aberdeenshire does not have the money or the capital budget for it. That is in the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State, as is Newtonhill. The community there wants a nursery school to be opened, even though higher priorities on the nursery school list, such as Asford, ought to take precedence. The council wants to provide such services, but budget restraints mean that it cannot do so in the short term.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to me and to my constituency. He may well have seen the demonstration by Laurencekirk parents as he entered the building today. They are worried about the provision of a new primary school. Grampian region used to have the opening of such a school on its priority list, but Aberdeenshire has slopped it off the list.<br><br>
Does the hon. Gentleman tolerate Aberdeenshire spending money on a project in his part of the area—a project that is likely to incur a revenue deficit of £100,000 a year—when that means that it deprives my constituents of Newtonhill nursery school and Laurencekirk primary school?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I gave way—I shall not give way again, but I shall be brief.<br><br>
The Minister well knows that Aberdeenshire council and its predecessor, Grampian regional council, have a proud record on developing nursery education during the past 10 or 15 years. That was never done when Conservatives controlled the region because they completely stopped it. I am not impressed with Tory Ministers saying that they are in favour of education when they create a financial climate that makes it difficult for local authorities to fund education.<br><br>
The Minister knows that my constituency would like a new academy to be built at Garioch to relieve overcrowding. The Liberal Democrats have said that we believe in education and that we will fund it. Our programme would put £1 billion more into Scottish education during the term of a full Parliament that has been committed by the Government or the Labour party. That would make an enormous difference to the provision of education services and would ease the pressure on other local government services. We are a party with clear, properly costed priorities that will make a difference. People should understand that we do not just criticise the Government, but that we present alternatives. The Government cannot shift around and attack us for our priorities when those have been clearly demonstrated and costed, but Ministers have a habit of picking another target when an issue has been addressed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0383">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
The Government should complete the study before they make value judgments and cut local government expenditure. They should tell the people of Scotland what it is about the Scottish education service that is so overpaid and oversubscribed that the Tories want to cut it back. The Secretary of State has made it clear that the Scottish education system is not safe in his hand. The sooner he goes the better.</span></p>
<p>12.57 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I too welcome the Committee to Angus, which is also part of my constituency? I was astonished to hear the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) say—I wrote his words down—"the total neglect of the Scottish people". I commend Committee members to drive around Angus and, if in doubt, North Tayside in particular, and tell me that we do not enjoy a quality of life that is envied by almost every country in the world. As for the fairy-tale economics expounded by the hon. Gentleman, I look forward to the opportunity of debating them at great length during the election campaign.<br><br>
I welcome the points made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, especially the A92 improvements. I also welcome the small town initiative for Brechin. As my right hon. Friend knows, after boundary changes Brechin will join other parts of Angus in my constituency. I also welcome the fact that so much of what can be done is being done to help local authorities. I see that as devolution of decision making. For local authorities to complain when they are given the opportunity to decide their priorities, is an indictment of the fact, which they should face, that they are not up to the job.<br><br>
I welcome the change in the capping regime to reward those authorities that merit it most and because Angus, Perth and Kinross are in my constituency, I welcome the changes to the special revenue grants—the spend to save. That is proper. I look forward to the capital consent change and what the £10 million will mean. It will give local authorities in Angus, Perth and Kinross opportunities to direct their attention to matters that they should be addressing as part of their responsibilities.<br><br>
As for housing, I sometimes wonder whether I live in the same world as other people in the Committee. Sheltered housing in my constituency, including that in the city of Perth when it was previously in my constituency, has advanced massively since 1979. It was almost totally neglected before then. When one considers the 34,400 houses built in Scotland, we begin to realise that at least we have our priorities right.<br><br>
Housing for the disabled has increased fivefold since we came into office in 1979. I remind hon. Members that 940,000 separate housing modernisation projects have been carried out on local authority houses. When one adds the private sector housing that has also enjoyed massive increases and improvements, one can understand why the centres of our cities are looking so much better than they did in 1979.<br><br>
We have nothing to apologise for in housing. I remind the Committee, as I have done in every debate that we have held about housing, that had we had sensible rents throughout the Scottish housing sector—especially for local authority housing—during the past 18 years,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
councils would have benefited enormously from the millions of pounds of additional housing benefit that would have gone straight into the housing coffers and could and should have been used for repairs and maintenance. But no—authorities bought votes with low rents and then blamed the Government for the lack of a sensible rents policy.<br><br>
If local authorities want to spend more money on repairs and renovations and all the other things they claim that they are not allowed or are unable to do, they could put the rents up. They have the power to do so. That is what decision making is all about. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I grew up in a council house, if anyone is interested. I know more about council houses than most of the people who discuss them. If there have been problems with housing schemes during the 18 years in which I have represented North Tayside, I defy anyone to say that they are the result of Government policy, rather than directly linked to local authority management.<br><br>
I welcome the fact that £1,100 vouchers will be given to parents so that they can choose pre-school provision. I believe that to be one of the best things that we have done because I believe in parental choice. Parents have a right to choose and are the best people to judge what is right for their children. It is pretty obvious that the Leader of the Opposition agrees. I do not argue with his right to choose, except that he wants to remove that right from others.<br><br>
I want to be brief because I know that many other hon. Members want to speak. I invite Committee members to drive around Angus and Perthshire and to tell me that the nonsense about the neglect of the Scottish people is a reality. It is not—it is a nonsense. The people who live in my constituency are far better off than they have ever been. One has only to wander in any of the supermarkets or go around the housing estates—look at the dishes for receiving satellite television. Such items demonstrate how much better life is. That is not to say that there are not people with problems—there will always be people with problems and a need to address them. That is why the unitary parliamentary structure takes are of individuals, if the Member of Parliament does his job properly.</span></p>
<p>1.3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief because time is short.<br><br>
One of the great political mysteries is why housing is so low among political priorities for the parties. Why is it not more of a burning issue in the general election campaign, which has already begun? If we examine the phoney election war that is being fought by the Government from its war room in Smith square in London, we realise that they have already set out the priorities on which they want to fight the election: the constitution, with which I do not really quarrel; education, or at least what the Tories claim to be education—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman. I have sat listening to claptrap from Conservative Members all morning. He will have to sit and listen to wisdom for a wee while. That will make a difference.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
The Government's priorities are: education, which the Tories define as the future of about 400 grammar schools in the south of England; taxation; law and order; and, the future of the armed services. Even the Tories never pretend that they will make housing a priority in any sense whatsoever and yet, if we examine the objective evidence in Scotland, we realise that housing is a key election issue for the people of Scotland. Any member of the Committee who has held a surgery knows about the importance of housing—that is clear form the number of complaints that constituents raise about it. The all-party Scottish housing group carried out a survey of Scottish Members of Parliament, which highlighted that housing was the most important matter in constituency surgeries.<br><br>
The Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland carried out an opinion poll that underlined the importance of housing and showed its links with ill-health, low educational attainment, poverty and the economy, which could improve dramatically with increased building. In that opinion poll, 78 per cent. said that they wanted greater investment in housing. Their views were blithely ignored by the Government, who simply pretend not to hear what people are saying.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Scotland tried to boast about the Government's housing record. he mentioned that subject briefly—not even he thought that it should dominate the speech that he gave this morning. he was here to play other political games; housing does not really matter to him. Those who know about housing in Scotland have commented on the Government's record. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, which represents more than 200 housing associations and co-operatives across Scotland, said that the cuts that the Secretary of State implemented will make next year the worst year for investment in housing in peacetime this century. Is the right hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who has been Secretary of State for Scotland for just a short time, proud of that achievement?<br><br>
Shelter has already warned about the national disgrace of homelessness, especially among youths, and it said that the Government's cuts in housing were ferocious. Other organisations have attacked the Government's housing record. For example, the SFHA wants a new house-building campaign, and—contrary to what the Secretary of State told us this morning—many others are backing its demand. Its backers include: the Scottish House-Builders Federation, which is hardly a left-wing group of red, dangerous insurrectionists; the Royal College of Nursing, which is hardly intent on revolution in this country; and Scottish Homes, which is the Government's own national housing agency. Scottish Homes backs the Government's enemies, which shows how bad the Government's housing record is. Other backers include local authorities, tenants' organisations, legal firms and financial institutions.<br><br>
Shelter is running a parallel campaign, called Housing for Good, which is backed by the SFHA, the tenants' information service, the tenants representative on the Scottish Homes board—whom the Government appointed—the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Scottish Building Employers Federation, the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland. They all deplore the Government's record.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
Time is short, so I shall concentrate on capital debt, which has, to some extent, dominated our debate this morning. About six months ago, the housing Minister wrote to me to explain the Government's policy towards capital debt. He said that they were forcing councils to use their capital receipts to reduce outstanding debt on houses. Local authority housing debt has increased since 1987 by 20 per cent. to about £4 billion. There are fewer council tenants to bear the burden of the associated loan charges. That Minister said that in order to protect rent payers and to reduce the debt, Scottish councils' capital receipts would be reduced by 25 per cent. this year and by 50 per cent. next year. In the past six months, however, he raised the latter figure to 75 per cent. without giving a word of explanation. He introduced the change by diktat.<br><br>
The Minister did not explain why the ratio of debt levels to the number of council tenants had become much worse in recent years. It worsened because of a deliberate act of Government—the right to buy—and it was stimulated by the fact that the Government forced councils to sell off housing stock at massive discounts. The Minister boasted that there were 320,000 fewer council tenants as a result of, for example, the right-to-buy scheme and he said that there were 16,000 fewer council tenants because of large-scale voluntary transfer. The debt associated with those houses, which was transferred form councils, remains with councils and council tenants. There are 320,000 fewer council tenants, so, inescapably, the effect of the Government's policy is to increase the debt burden on council tenants. The problem that the Minister identified to me in his letter was created by the Government's deliberate actions.<br><br>
Having created the problem, the Government chose to compound it by making things even harder for council tenants. The rule relating to 75 per cent. of capital receipts has various implications. This year's capital receipts to Scottish councils may be as much as £227 million. Based on that figure, if we apply the 75 per cent. rule, next year £170 million will be diverted away from investment in council housing. There will be fewer window repair and central heating programmes, less modernisation, fewer adaptations for people with physical disabilities and longer council waiting lists. Council tenants will be the losers. Because of the rule, the Minister is making worse the lives of the very people he claims to have acted to protect.<br><br>
Right-to-buy schemes and large-scale voluntary transfers were central Government's housing policy. The Government, therefore, should pay for that policy. The debt associated with houses that were transferred out of local authority control should have been transferred to central Government. The Government did that with Scottish Homes and they have never explained why they will not do it with local councils in Scotland.<br><br>
In reality, the Government could not care less about council tenants in Scotland. In the same letter that he wrote to me last August, the Minister complained that there had been a few large-scale voluntary transfers to date. He singled out Berwickshire district council as being the norm for future council housing developmental policy in Scotland under the Conservatives. He wanted all local authorities in Scotland to transfer all their housing stock to alternative landlords in the way that Berwickshire district council had done. In other words, the Minister has openly admitted his ambition to end council housing in Scotland. He wants it finished and done away with.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
I am a great supporter of the community ownership sector. Housing associations and co-operatives have many strengths. However, there are 600,000 council tenants and only 100,000 tenants in the community ownership sector. Nobody can persuade me that if 600,000 council tenants were transferred into the community ownership sector, that sector would remain the same and retain its strengths. Of course it would not; it would be completely transformed.<br><br>
This is the Government that did away with the Scottish Special Housing Association and set up Scottish Homes; that made Scottish Homes abandon its landlord role; that got rid of the new towns and are now getting rid of council housing. Community ownership will be next in line if the Government can con council tenants into transferring. They are not conning me, council tenants or the people of Scotland.<br><br>
I do not care about promises made before an election. I care about only one thing: the defeat of the Government in two months' time. That should be the aim of everyone in Scotland.</span></p>
<p>1.12 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear to me this morning that what we have heard from the Conservative Benches is the view from the parallel universe. I usually encounter that universe only in science fiction novels, but given the Government pronouncements that have been made on a number of subjects, that universe seems to have come down among us during the past weeks and months.<br><br>
Our debate has been interesting because it has veered backwards and forwards between local government finance—particularly—housing. I should like to talk a little about local government finance. I note the emphasis that the Secretary of State wants to place on his brand new shiny report, which cost nearly £250,000. He is prepared to spend £250,000 on a piece of paper but not on Scottish housing. The only jobs that the Government seem able to create these days appear to be consultants' jobs. However, the report is a fairly damp squib which has been comprehensively rubbished in the media and by Committee members today so I shall try to avoid discussing it in great detail.<br><br>
A problem for the Conservative party is that local authority priorities in Scotland reflect the demand from the electorate. As everybody knows, when there is a projected cut in service provision there is an outcry because people in Scotland want to see services protected, not cut.<br><br>
The Conservatives' attitude, so easily betrayed today by the Secretary of State, graphically explains why Scotland has no Conservative-controlled local authorities. The Government have singularly failed to acknowledge that a reduction in local authorities' budgets must mean poorer service provision. If that is what they want, why do they not come right out and say it? They could be honest with the voters. Conservative Members do not care if class sizes in Scotland get bigger; they do not care if the roads are not repaired; they do not care if there are fewer well-qualified teachers in employment; they do not care that the fabric of Scottish housing continues to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
deteriorate or that homelessness is on the increase. Government spending cuts to Scottish Homes alone mean that there will be only 1,500 new starts this year.<br><br>
We have already heard figures about the level of homelessness in Scotland. I am indebted to the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) for mentioning local issues. Some 2,500 households are on the Perth and Kinross priority waiting list for housing; that figure is for Perth and Kinross alone. If we multiply that across Scotland, we can see the extent of the problem introduced by the Government through their cuts.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has made his usual delivery, outlining all the marvellous benefits that the housing sector has enjoyed since 1979. He stated that the feather bedding of local authorities has gone on and on. That is a view from a parallel universe. I truly wish that the Secretary of State would save his breath. We have heard it all before and the right hon. Gentleman must be sick of listening to himself. Some of us prefer the evidence of our eyes and ears and know his statements for the sham that they are. To take, for instance, this mockery of the so-called scope for councils to generate further resources for investment by transferring stock to other landlords: what about the hypothetical local authority that has succeeded in transferring all of its housing stock? It will be paying debts for the foreseeable future on houses that it does not own, but on which it must still pay the debt.<br><br>
The Secretary of State must answer the question on housing debt, which has rightly played a big part in today's debate. If commuting the water debt was merely a technical exercise, why will the Secretary of State not undertake the same technical exercise for housing debt? It is all very well for him to sit and sigh and shake his head, but the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) made that remark about the water debt. Either the hon. Gentleman was wrong, or we are right now. The Secretary of State cannot have it both ways—either it is a technical exercise, or it is not. If it was not a technical exercise, we were being misled. The problem is not that the Secretary of State cannot commute the debt as he did with water: the fact is that he simply will not.<br><br>
We do not want to hear the old chestnut about the public sector borrowing requirement. When the water debt was commuted, we were told that it would not effect the PSBR. The reason that the Secretary of State will not commute the housing debt is because it would mean more freedom for local authorities, which he cannot abide. The Secretary of State cannot abide local democracy. There is blinkered dogma from the Conservative Benches and a hatred of local democracy. Conservative Members are willing to have an overburdened health service which struggles to cope as a direct result of housing strategy. I heard no solution from anyone.<br><br>
I hope that we will hear some response now to the thus far unpublished Department of Environment research referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh). The research found that the cost to the health budget of poor housing and homelessness is £2 billion. The Secretary of State would rather the money be spent unnecessarily instead of dealing with the root cause of the problem. He is willing for jobs to be lost in the construction industry. There is a variety of estimates of the impact of cuts on jobs. I understand that Highland council commissioned Mackay consultants to examine
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0386">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
projected job losses and came up with a figure of 43 private sector jobs lost for every £1 million reduction in council capital spending.<br><br>
If funding of Scottish Homes had continued at 1995–96 levels, funding for 1996–97 and for 1997–98 would have totalled £640 million. The best that can now be achieved as a result of the Government's intervention is £520 million. That is a loss of £120 million. If we add in the private finance which could have been levered in—I understand the figure to be £1 of private finance for every £1 of public sector money—the loss is nearer to £200 million. My estimate is that between 5,000 and 8,000 jobs will be lost in Scotland as a direct result of the cuts. The Government are creating unemployment through their vendetta against local government.<br><br>
Several matters have already been discussed. I want to mention the figure of £27 billion about which there has been some debate. I hear the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) trying to rubbish the figure—before he does so, I suggest that he take a look at the issue of <i>Hansard</i> from which the figure derives. The hon. Gentleman should examine the Government figures and accept the reality of the past 19 years of Tory rule and what they have meant for Scotland. He should consider the amount of money that would have been available if we had had a complete say over our own affairs. It is no use saying that those are fantasy figures. I remember the Government saying that the SNP's predictions for oil revenues were fantasy figures, but they turned out to be underestimates. The only fantasies are those in the minds of the current Government and, unfortunately, Labour Front-Bench Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am sorry, but I shall not give way. There is hardly any time left and I know that the Minister wants to deal with points that have been raised.<br><br>
Let me say something more generally about the Labour party. I know many good and principled people in the Labour party—some may even be here today—but they must be sorely disappointed at the contribution of their Front-Bench Members this morning. It is one thing to attack the Government's record; it is another entirely to avoid all mention of what an incoming Labour Government would do.<br><br>
With his weasel words, the hon. Member for Leith made it clear that a Labour Government have no intention of tackling the problems in Scotland's housing or local authorities. This was an opportunity for the Labour party to say at the very least that it would change the rule that requires local authorities to use 75 per cent. of their capital receipts for debt repayment. That would not be a spending commitment; all the Labour party had to say today was that it would restore the status quo ante and put the level back to 50 per cent., for which all the local authorities had planned and budgeted. I did not hear even that minimum commitment. The silence of Labour Members is deafening and sadly revealing.<br><br>
Given the time, I had better finish and let the Minister respond, although there are a number of other matters that I wanted to raise. I say in conclusion that I thank the Secretary of State for his statements on the slight changes he proposes for some local authorities. I thank him particularly for his endorsement of good SNP
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
management in the three councils that we run; I notice that they are all mentioned on the list. The tragedy is—as he knows; he has said it himself—that the effects of his changes will be broadly neutral. He has said nothing today that will change the situation in Scotland. That is an indictment of his Government.</span></p>
<p>1.22 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. I have been fascinated by the contributions from Opposition Members, particularly from the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham). Given that she succeeded such a renowned Member as the late Sir Nicky Fairbairn, I had thought that it would be entertaining to listen to her, but she follows the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) in showing a total lack of understanding of financial matters, especially in regard to local government finance.</span></p>
<p>[MR. ALLAN STEWART <i>in the Chair</i></p>
<p>Let me deal, once and for all, with the debt commutation for the water authorities. The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross seems to think that that commutation involved no cost, but it involved a reduction in the water authorities' external financing limit; they lost in order to gain that commutation.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) asked where the hon. Member for Angus, East would find the means to write off housing debt. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State gave, as usual, a splendid speech with welcome announcements that will benefit local government—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way. My time has already been cut short.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that he would be interested to hear how the hon. Member for Angus, East could commute the housing debt with no cost to anyone. The hon. Gentleman said that he would come to that, but, of course, he never did.<br><br>
That was like the hon. Member for Leith, who was asked by the housing Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson), whether he would pledge that a Labour Government—should one, God forbid, ever come to power—would stick with 75 per cent. redemption or whether they would set the level at 50 per cent., 25 per cent. or nothing. The hon. Member for Leith said that he would come to that, but he did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was not listening. My speech had a long passage about the 75 per cent. rule as it related to wasting money on housing benefit. The saving is not as the Minister claims. We are currently reviewing the 75 per cent. rule to take account of the extra housing benefit. Given the 75 per cent. rule's devastating effect on housing investment, something clearly needs to be done about it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0387">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have heard that it is being reviewed; the right hon. Members for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) and for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) have not yet given the hon. Member for Leith his instructions. We know that at present all instructions to Labour Members come from south of the border and that there is little interest in what is going on in Scotland.<br><br>
By contrast, the Government have given significant funding for local authority housing; the net provision has been maintained at £180 million each year for the next three years. That means that more than £500 million will be invested in council housing over those three years. We can add to that a portion of the receipts that can be generated from the sale of council houses and other housing assets.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Angus, East referred to the mismatch situation in Angus, but he failed to point out to the Committee and his constituents that, during this year and next year, the people of Angus will gain from the allocation of formula-based funding, whereas other will lose. That is what the mismatch is all about. The hon. Gentleman contends that his local authority is a good spender and refers to it as if it were among the more prudent. I ask him why his local authority wanted capping to be raised so that it could put up the council tax by 79 per cent. That is the budget level that it must have considered to be able to talk about such large "cuts". The long and the short of it is that Angus could, before today's capping announcement, increase its expenditure for this coming year by £3.7 million.<br><br>
Today, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has responded to those who have approached us during the past few days and weeks asking for a little more flexibility so that they can spend a little more. I must lay it on the line, however, that such increased spending will be at the expense of the council tax payer. Far from rewarding what the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross called the good
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
SNP councils, we are giving them the option to apply a bigger increase in council tax, and we may rest assured that they will probably make use of that option.<br><br>
Just like the Labour party, the Scottish nationalists have failed to recognise the current level of expenditure in local government in Scotland. The Coopers and Lybrand and Pieda report, to which much reference has been made today, put paid to past comments by pointing out clearly that local government in Scotland is well funded. Given the increases per head of population that are incurred in local government services in Scotland, severe questions have to be answered. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State asked whether any Opposition Member would say why local planning expenditure per head is 76.7 per cent. greater in Scotland than it is south of the border. Such questions should be answered.<br><br>
We should be looking responsibly at expenditure, because we have increased funding from central taxation—that is not Government money, it is taxpayers' money. We have acted responsibly in ensuring that taxpayers' money is applied wisely and I expect local authorities to do the same. I expect them to be critical, to look at and use the report, to question their service delivery and, I hope, ensure that taxpayers are given good value for money.<br><br>
Should the Labour party ever come to power, it will be under significant pressure to reduce funding if it goes down the tax-raising Parliamentary route. If funding is reduced, we can rest assured that service delivery will also be reduced. The hon. Member for Leith cannot answer those points. He cannot say how much more he believes local government in Scotland should receive or from where that money should come. All he does is criticise the Government, but the Government have given local authorities in Scotland a good deal.</span></p>

Transfer of Crofting Estates (Scotland) Bill [Lords]</div> <!-- title -->
<p>1.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the Transfer of Crofting Estates (Scotland) Bill [<i>Lords</i>] in relation to the principle of the Bill.</p></blockquote>
The Bill is an enabling measure to give the Secretary of State for Scotland the power to dispose of his crofting estate to bodies that he believes are representative of the crofters on the estates. Such organisations are commonly referred to as crofting trusts. I shall refer to them as such, although members of the Committee will wish to note that there will be no requirement that the bodies be trusts in the traditional legal sense.<br><br>
The Bill is the result of the crofting trusts initiative, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland launched in the autumn of 1995, when he made it clear that he would be willing to consider transferring the Scottish Offices's crofting estate to a crofting trust. The aim was to give crofters on the estates greater control over the land and to offer them all the advantages that private ownership can bring.<br><br>
In February last year, my right hon. Friend published a consultation paper entitled "Crofting Trusts", which set out his proposals in greater detail. It made it clear that the Government would be willing to consider transferring the estates at no consideration to help to ensure the viability of all the trusts; that the transfer would be on a voluntary basis; and that existing tenants who became tenants of a crofting trust would continue to enjoy the protection, rights and obligations that apply under the existing legislation. The paper also made it clear that the Government have no intention of selling the estates to other third parties. Its proposals were widely welcomed.<br><br>
In drawing up the Bill, we have developed proposals which allow a flexible approach to address the differing circumstances of individual crofting communities. We know that there is no one type of trust that will address the needs of all the communities involved and we do not wish to limit unduly the options available to crofters who wish to pursue such an opportunity.<br><br>
The Bill gives my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State the flexibility to transfer land to different types and sizes of trusts that might be proposed by the crofters. It would allow individual trusts to be based on part of an estate, a whole estate or aggregations of estates.<br><br>
Clause 1 gives the Secretary of State a discretionary power to dispose of his crofting property and associated rights on terms to be agreed with the recipient body.<br><br>
Clause 2 requires the Secretary of State to consult the Crofters Commission before disposal and that the disposal should be made only to bodies that are representative of crofting interests in the property to be disposed of and which have the promotion of the residents on the property as their primary objective.<br><br>
Clause 3 provides the Secretary of State with the power to provide financial assistance towards the costs of establishing a crofting trust and to defray expenditure incurred by a trust in effecting the transfer of the property.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
Clause 4 ensures that the Scottish Office is not required to undertake all conveyancing and related work involved in a transfer. Instead, trusts will commission that work with assistance, when that is agreed, under the provisions of Clause 3.<br><br>
Clause 5 removes for all time any right of pre-emption over any property in the estate, while providing for compensation to be paid to those who have lost the right of pre-emption.<br><br>
Clause 6 ensures the continuation of a right to buy, which arises from the Land Settlement (Scotland) Act 1919 and applies to tenants of non-crofting land who have been on their holdings for more than six years.<br><br>
The Bill offers an important opportunity to the crofting tenants of the Secretary of State for Scotland. It offers them benefits of ownership and will allow them to make their own decisions and to address their own needs and circumstances in their own way. I commend the Bill to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>1.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to follow the Minister's example and be as brief as possible, although, for obvious constituency reasons, I may not be as brief as he was.<br><br>
I begin my remarks by declaring an interest both as a tenant crofter on Lochiel estates in Lochaber and as a life member of the Scottish Crofters Union. Indeed, this is my second opportunity to debate crofting matters in the Grand Committee. At our meeting in Dundee last year, the Secretary of State responded to my Adjournment debate about proposed changes to the system of grants and loans. The Committee was glad to record, as were the crofting counties, that, as a result of that debate, the schemes were to remain intact. That was a good development.<br><br>
I am also conscious of the traditional west highland definition of a croft—an area of ground surrounded by legislation. Given that we are hammering in a few more legislative fence posts, it is worth considering one or two aspects of what is proposed in the Bill with a view to its further stages—assuming that it reaches the statute book before the general election.<br><br>
My right hon. and hon. Friends and I very much welcome the principles of the Bill, which represents a good step forward. However, we are mindful—I hope that the Government are, too—of the telling phrase in the original submission from the Scottish Crofters Union—there is no simple, single solution to the issue of crofting trusts. We would all do well to take on board those wise words.<br><br>
By way of background to the Bill, I looked to some of the crofting communities under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State on Skye. Opinion was divided when measures similar to those in the Bill were first proposed as a way forward when Lord Sanderson was the Minister of State with responsibility for the highlands. There was insufficient collective will for the proposals to proceed then.<br><br>
Given that the Assynt example in Sutherland has been held up as something of a trail blazer, it is worth stating that opinion there was not unanimous when the crofting trust proposal first came to light. We are talking about 53 estates—105,000 hectares, 150 townships and 1,400 crofters, who might be affected by the Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
The Bill is permissive rather prescriptive, which is generally the right way forward. however, the lack of unanimity within the crofting counties is relevant. For example, the Crofters Commission reported that the 12 of the 53 estates within the Secretary of State's jurisdiction that responded to the original consultation document were by no means unanimous.<br><br>
The Crofting Trust Advisory Service is undertaking three feasibility studies—one on Skye, two in Sutherland. There is a pretty trenchant division of opinion in the Armadale community in north-west Sutherland. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland, who is detained on parliamentary business in Westminster, has consulted people in Armadale and hopes to contribute to the debate in Committee, although I appreciate that that decision rests outwith any hands here today.<br><br>
In considering the potential development of crofting trusts, I shall deal with one or two matters that arise against a certain backdrop—we are not dealing with a clear, unambiguous opinion across the crofting counties. First, the mechanism is important. There must be a CTAS feasibility study of each trust application. When considering the outcome of those studies, the Crofters Commission must take account of local opinion and determine what constitutes a majority in any given area.<br><br>
For example, the Crofters Commission would be unwise to use a straight numerical majority as used in Divisions in the House. Frankly, if there were a favourable feasibility study but a 51:49 split in opinion, the potential crofting trust would not work. The commission must consider the age profiles of those who are pro and those who are anti and the vested interests within communities as well as the wider community interests before making any recommendation to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The Scottish Crofters Union has given voice to the anxiety that the Crofters Commission might face a conflict of interest, especially when dealing with charged examples, as it has to be not only the impartial judge of the issue but the statutory body making recommendations to the Secretary of State. It is important for the Minister to stress again that there is no question of crofters being coerced into crofting trusts against their will and that the feasibility study and all that follows will take notice of those wider considerations.<br><br>
Certain issues will need to be examined at the point of transfer and beyond. I note that the phrase "burden sharing" has come into the Bill's vocabulary. That expression was used in the defence debate when the Americans were disengaging from their commitment on mainland Europe. Burden sharing in this context is about the costs that could accrue to crofting trusts as a result of the overheads that may go with them, such as infrastructure projects. Related to those are the transfers of associated rights such as mineral and sporting assets. An important question further down the track, well beyond the legislation, is what may happen about the later disposal of assets by the trust.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
I say in passing that even fairly soon in its short life, the Assynt trust has already made some marginal disposal of assets and that has not disturbed the equilibrium of the community. However, it raises the important issue of what would happen if a trust were forced, because of financial overheads, or because of the structure and development of local opinion in the community, to take a course that involved a substantial disposal of assets.<br><br>
I gather from the Crofters Commission that it does not wish to have a remedial or stand-back power when a trust decides to pursue disposal of assets. The commission takes the view that it should be treated like any other landlord once it is up and running.<br><br>
The National Trust is under a legal prohibition in disposing of some of its assets and we must carefully consider the longer-term position of a crofting trust. If the issue is not dealt with in the Bill, it should be considered in more detail in the articles of association or in deciding the nature of the limited company, whatever shape or form the trust takes. Ultimately, there may have to be recourse to the land court.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned pre-emption, which, again, is relevant to the point of transfer. There were changes as the Bill make its way through the House of Lords and it was suggested that there should be a four-month period for any rights of pre-emption to be taken into consideration. That is about the right compromise. One of the protagonists in the Lords tabled an amendment proposing three months and there were earlier suggestions of six weeks and six months. The Scottish Crofters Union took the view that six weeks was too short and six months too long. A three to four-month period is more or less correct and is a sensible development.<br><br>
It goes slightly beyond the context of the proposal, but I hope that the Minister will say something about the legal developments resulting from the court action initiated by Ross and Cromarty district council over feudal rights, which went to the House of Lords. Will the pre-emption issue that arose have any bearing on the matter and does the Scottish Office see any merit in applying those developments to crofting itself?<br><br>
It is important not to be restrictive in the type of model that we allow to develop as a result of the proposal. There are already many different models, of which Assynt is one. For example, the National Trust owns Fair Isle, which has a very vibrant local crofting community, managed by a local democratic management committee. A benevolent landlord, whatever shape or form it may take, can be a force for good. Where there is not a benevolent landlord—the obvious example of Eigg comes to mind—it can be to the detriment of an area. We do not want to be restrictive and to impose a uniform model in each and every case, because local circumstances vary.<br><br>
During the transition period, as crofting trusts begin to come on stream, mixed provisions will be required in the crofting counties. Some communities will remain wedded tot he status quo, with the Secretary of State and the Department as landlord. Other communities will want to move fairly quickly to crofting trust status. Providing the various conditions of viability are met, they should not be held back.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
In the longer term—I am a little worried that it could happen too soon—moves may be made towards a pan-highland trust. In that respect, it is better to walk before we can run. If too much effort, too soon, is put into the establishment of a pan-highland trust, the various complexities that could arise might hold back legitimate local efforts to establish more ad hoc or individual crofting trusts.<br><br>
On behalf of my colleagues, I welcome the principle of the Bill. The word "trust" is appropriate because, as the Committee reports from the Lords show, an awful lot is being taken on trust. Not much is written into the Bill. The Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and the Environment in Scotland, Lord Lindsay, offered many reassurances about the good will and the good intent of the Governement, but the Bill leaves much in the hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland of the day. It is important, as the Bill progresses, that we flesh out the principles, if not in the Bill at least in our discussions about it, to get it right not only for the present generation of crofters but for future generations.</span></p>
<p>1.47 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Bill. Only 18 years after coming to office and a few months before the general election, the Government now recognise the important of the land question in the highlands. The Bill is modest and limited in that it relates only to the Secretary of State's responsibility for crofting estates and leaves other aspects untouched. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State's remit is extensive. As the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) said, there are 50 separate crofting estates, 105,000 hectares, 150 townships and 1,400 separate crofts.<br><br>
The Bill gives rights to the Secretary of State through the Crofting Commission rather than conferring rights on people. The question of trust, mentioned by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, is therefore extremely important. We must recognise the cost. The publicly owned crofts cost the public purse more than £200,000 a year.<br><br>
Although no major policies or questions of principle divide us, various matters need to be fleshed out. A study undertaken by for a steering groups that included the Scottish Crofters Union, the Highland council and the Western Isles council noted the substantial benefits to be gained from a pan-highland crofting land trust. However, it warned that the transfer of land from Scottish office ownership to crofters would not be straightforward.<br><br>
It costs the Scottish office's Agriculture, Forestry and Environment Department at average of £400,000 a year to run 53 crofting estates. Each year, the estates currently generate £103,000 in rent, £44,000 in sporting income and an extra £20,000 for mineral leases. Dr. Fraser MacLeod of the Scottish Crofting Union said that if the estates were run at a loss for the Scottish office, the crofters should take a cautious approach to the Secretary of State's offer.<br><br>
The study estimates that it will cost £450,000 to handle the estates and to establish staff, administration, resources, audits and development plans. If that does not come from the Scottish Office, where will it come from? There is an obligation on the Government to come up with resources, and that should be flushed out in Committee.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
Lord Lindsay suggested in the other place that, with the best will in the world, officials employed by a Government Department cannot be as sensitive to local needs and priorities as those who live there. Different solutions are needed for different problems in different communities. The Opposition concur with those sentiments.<br><br>
The Bill is necessary because there is no general power in the original legislation to allow the Government to dispose of land to third parties. The Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 1976 contained several provisions, but nothing about common grazing. It is therefore important that the Bill is enacted. If the Bill's central object is to strengthen community development in sparsely populated areas of Scotland, and the Government agree with that, it needs to be strengthened in a number of ways.<br><br>
As the hon. member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye said, the transfer of crofts should enjoy the confidence, support and agreement of all those affected. I wish to draw the Minister's attention to one or two matters in which we believe the Government have been over-cautious. The first relates to public crofting estates only and the second to giving the Secretary of State powers instead of conferring rights to crofters.<br><br>
It is possible that in some cases land will be transferred to which the Government will retain the rights. That could be unacceptable. In many cases, sporting or mineral rights represent the only actual or potential route to economic viability. The lack of such rights would seriously constrain local development. Burdens on land, such as bridges and drainage systems, will be transferred to communities. It would be illogical not also to transfer the rights. I am aware that amendments were tabled in the other place on that issue.<br><br>
We are also concerned that the land given to crofting communities will immediately be transferred to third parties who might even de-croft some or all of the land, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye. We are happy with the clear mechanism for the first disposal to the trust, but what will happen thereafter? Could a trust dispose of the land as it likes and take it out of crofting tenure—for example for housing development? The subsequent disposal is extremely important. I should like the Minister to comment on the issue of the trigger mechanism which ensures a transfer only where there is evidence of demonstrable support.<br><br>
I note one or two comments by interested parties, in particular the Law Society of Scotland which mentions the long title of Bill referring to "certain other property". Clause 1(3) (c) introduces non-crofting property to the Bill. What is the purpose of including non-crofting property? It is difficult to understand how it is appropriate for the Bill to refer to non-crofting property when its purpose is to dispose of land to a body representative of all the crofting community with an interest in the land.<br><br>
I also need clarification of clause 1(5) which allows the Secretary of State to dispose of
<br><blockquote><p>"mineral, sporting or other rights"</p></blockquote>
relating to the property unless good reason is shown for their exclusion. Some bodies in the highlands also want those rights to be transferred. I ask the Minister for his comments on that matter.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
The Macauley Land Use Research Institute points out that the only matter that is not specifically covered by the Bill is the process by which the tenant crofters or their representative organisations can initiate an expression of interest in acquiring the Secretary of State's crofting estates. In so far as the Secretary of State will have wide enabling powers if the Bill is passed, that may not be an issue, but it occurs to the institute that the process of initiation by which the objectives of the Bill will ultimately be achieved might, with advantage, be formalised to ensure that the Secretary of State and the crofters—or their representative organisations—understand the conditions that must be met before the Secretary of State can exercise his powers.<br><br>
Just as the Bill was published, the Scottish Crofters Union made the point to us that trust is essential, as the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye said, because many crofters have never bought or sold a croft. Mobility in those areas, unlike that in towns, is not great. If such a mechanism is set up, a number of points must be considered. First, education about what is involved is important—the Government are upfront on that issue. Secondly, there must be advice on the drawing down of funds for developing the estates, because obligations that may not have been foreseen could be laid on a trust when an estate is transferred. Thirdly, crofters must be involved in the management of properties on behalf of the community. While it would be welcome to have them transferred—there is currently a good head of support for that—some people could end up in a sorry state of affairs down the line if the proper management procedures are not put into place. No one wants that.<br><br>
We all welcome the provision and the transfer of power. Such a devolution is vital. The crofters need support so that communities in the highlands and islands benefit and can be maintained. In that spirit, we welcome the measure.</span></p>
<p>1.57 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for missing his first few sentences due to the fact that I was having a wrestling match with the fax machine outside.<br><br>
The Scottish National party broadly welcomes the Bill, but has certain reservations which I shall make clear. Generally, the Bill represents a lost opportunity. The interim report of the Scottish Land Commission shows that there is widespread support for radical land reform, not only of the system of feudal law but, equally, of the crofting system. I appreciate that the Bill is narrowly focused, but it touches on two opportunities for wider reforms that could have been extended and might be considered in Committee.<br><br>
I shall speak first about the issues relating to pre-emption. It is right for the Government to protect proposed sales by removing any pre-emption rights which might be attached to the Secretary of State's estate. But why has that not been extended to the whole of Scotland? As many people know, aspects of pre-emption still cause problems outside the crofting areas. My party is also
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
worried about the increasing number of feudal speculators in Scotland who are snapping up feudal superiorities and looking to exploit pre-emption rights to make a fast buck at the expense of purchasers, their solicitors or their insurers. It would be fairly simple to extend the Bill's protections to the whole of Scotland. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that.<br><br>
Secondly, the Bill deals with the Secretary of State's crofting estates and, thus, draws out attention to the system of crofting in Scotland. Again, the Scottish Land Commission report points to the widespread support for the crofting system of land tenure which is acknowledge as being, on the whole, environmentally friendly—it has at its core the sustainability of our rural communities.<br><br>
"The Dingwall Agenda", Frank Rennie's discussion paper on land reform and rural development in Scotland, points to the key contribution of the crofting system. The paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is becoming generally accepted that the crotin style of small-scale, low-intensity landuse, with security of tenure, access for home-building, and some degree of occupational pluralism is one valid model of sustaining community and economic development in rural areas of Scotland. It is also being recognised that good crofting agricultural practices very often are also good for the natural environment, in contrast to other, more intensive styles."</p></blockquote>
In the context, I echo the call of "The Dingwall Agenda" and the Scottish Land Commission to consider the possibility of extending crofting as a system of land tenure and development.<br><br>
The Crofting Acts created a narrow and rigid structure. It is time for the system to expand and for new crofting units to be established. I strongly agree with the idea that there should be flexibility in the type of units that are established. I also want the Government to consider as a way forward providing new land for new crofts. Such a dynamic approach to crofting from the Government would have been welcomed, but the Bill is not as visionary as one would have wanted. Will the Government look more widely at the issue of crofting?<br><br>
My main concerns about the Bill centre on clause 2. There are potential problems with communal areas, especially if the body to which the land is disposed is not representative of everyone in the community. It will be difficult to get the agreement of everyone in each community—grazing rights, for example, are an important aspect of crofting. I hope that that issue will be taken into account before the land is transferred.<br><br>
What will happen to scattered crofts and communities for whom transfers to a body as specified in the Bill might not be appropriate? Will the Secretary of State remain the landowner and landlord in such situations, or could those people find themselves transferred to the guardianship of yet another quango? That would be totally inappropriate. The last thing the crofting community needs is the involvement in its affairs of yet another quango.<br><br>
It is not often that I compliment the Scottish Office, but it has proved itself to be a popular and effective landlord. There is a real chance that people might exercise their right to remain as tenants. Will the Minister confirm that those who take that decision will be fully respected and allowed to retain their status as the Secretary of State's tenants?<br><br>

<p>2.3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to Opposition Members for the support that they have given the Bill. They have raised a number of specific matters, some of which related to their constituents and some to other parties.

The Bill has benefited from consultation. We published a consultation paper in February last year and draft clauses in October, while the Select Committee in another place took evidence from interested parties in December.

Home Energy Efficiency</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—[<i>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson.</i>]</p>
<p>2.4 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have the opportunity of this Adjournment debate. I confess that this is the first time that I have visited Montrose—I have tended to speed north up to Aberdeen. Despite the somewhat inclement weather, however, I intend to return.<br><br>
I am glad to have the opportunity to raise my concerns and those of many others over the Government's actions on home energy schemes. There are many excellent home energy schemes, but the work they do and the employment they provide are being threatened by recent Government proposals and, dare I say it, a lack of funding.<br><br>
Let me briefly mention three of the schemes that have operated successfully under the 1991 home energy efficiency scheme. The first, a local scheme, is SCARF—save cash and reduce fuel—which is the energy advice centre for Aberdeen and the north-east. I applaud its work and give the Committee one example of how the advice that it and others offer can bring real benefits. A pensioner moved into a council property, but was unable to seek work to supplement her income support due to poor health. She had no savings, but had to pay £11.54 a week just to keep her council flat warm. SCARF was able to give her independent and expert advice on using the available heating and reducing her gas costs. It also provided her with draught proofing. As a result, it reduced her heating costs from £11.54 a week to £4.87 a week—a substantial saving. While that did not give her a bountiful amount to spend, it at least made it easier for her to cope.<br><br>
The second scheme to which I pay tribute is Heatwise Fife, which is in my local area. It has brought comfort and decency to the lives of many people in Fife. I place on public record my appreciation and thanks for the work of its manager, Dave Cross, and his team. Tragically, because of Government cuts and changes, there will be redundancies at Heatwise Fife, rather than expansion.<br><br>
The third success that I want to mention by way of introduction is the Heatwise scheme in Glasgow, which was one of the pioneers in combining tackling fuel poverty with giving work to the long-term unemployed. In 12 years, it has insulated more than 115,000 homes, which has resulted in energy savings of £5 million a year. It currently employs 70 full-time staff and 221 people on short-term contracts. Those jobs are, however, under threat.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will join me in supporting such schemes and that he will deal with their concerns. I am sure that he is aware of the extent and nature of fuel poverty in Scotland, but I want to mention a few of the statistics. It is reckoned that 30 per cent. of Scottish houses suffer from dampness, condensation or mould, while more than 85,000 are officially below the tolerable standard. More than 750,000 Scottish households suffer fuel poverty, which is defined as the inability to afford adequate warmth in the home because of its energy inefficiency, a situation which is exacerbated by low income and disability.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
Poorer families and individuals spend a much higher proportion of their scant incomes—as much as 40 per cent.—on fuel. They tend to be at home more because they are of pensionable age, ill, disabled, unemployed or because they care for young children. Age Concern Scotland reckons that more than 40,000 Scottish pensioners over 75 live in homes with no central heating, double glazing or wall insulation, and 33,000 pensioners over 75 live in homes affected by penetrating or rising damp.<br><br>
Fuel poverty affects rural communities such as Montrose, Grampian and the Highlands as much as it affects urban centres, even though the latter have been highlighted more often. Older people are more likely to live in a house that is below the tolerable standard and to suffer or even die from hypothermia, because they cannot afford both to heat and eat.<br><br>
This winter has been milder than last, but we should not speak too soon as Scotland often has snow in May or even later. A constituent who came to my surgery at the weekend had dealt with two elderly people suffering from hypothermia in the past week. Tragically, one died; the other survived, but only just. My constituent was firmly of the view that the problem persists and is not reducing.<br><br>
Scotland has the worst record on hypothermia in northern Europe: 2,500 die from it here each year, and we do not compare favourably with countries that have even colder climates. For example, a typical house in Sweden is 5 deg. warmer than its Scottish counterpart, but uses 25 per cent. less energy as a result of better insulation and more efficient heating systems.<br><br>
I want to highlight some of the changes that the Government are making to existing energy schemes. Those changes are causing great anxiety. First, in this 1996–97 financial year the resources available to such home energy schemes were cut by 31 per cent. Taking inflation into account, there will be a standstill budget for the 1997–98 financial year. Overall, the amount of money made available in the past six years will have been devalued by 18.2 per cent.<br><br>
The grant available for insulation of draft proofing remains at a gross amount of £315. That is not sufficient to support the additional measures that the Government have introduced. It does not provide the maximum choice with regard to the work that has to be done in a given home; nor does it cover the VAT costs on the work involved.<br><br>
This morning, the Minister responded to a question from me by talking about the Government's generosity and the responsibilities of local authorities. Although I welcomed the scheme's introduction in 1991, as I have welcomed a great deal of the work that has been done, over the past 12 to 18 months it has become clear that the Government have not increased resources. The changes that they are making will restrict tenants' important ability to choose.<br><br>
The Government's second change will limit choice by restricting people's ability to receive a combination of home insulation and draught proofing, along with energy advice. Choice will be limited, not expanded. The Government propose that the existing measures and the new ones must be ranked and divided into three groups. People will be put either into the group dealing with insulation and heating controls or into a second group dealing, for instance, with draught proofing.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
The choice for many people, especially those on low incomes, will be either/or. I am sure that the residents of Montrose and other people all over the north of Scotland will say, "Well, it would be nice to have loft insulation, but if we still have an icy north-east or north-west wind coming through our doors and windows, what help will it be in keeping our homes warm?" The Government seem to be restricting choice to many who most need a combination of the two measures.<br><br>
The third concern about the changes that the Government will introduce relates to the removal of a separate grant for energy advice. It is felt that that will put vulnerable people at risk from those who are seeking not to provide fully independent advice but simply to increase their business.</span></p>

Lady in my capacity as convenor of the all-party warm homes group? I hope that she will join us in the next Session. Does she agree that one other aspect that has affected the idea of improved insulation is that local authorities and various network associations were dealing with buildings in multiple occupancy, and the withdrawal of grants for those buildings, despite the huge success of that work in Scotland, will affect many vulnerable people?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for supporting me and for making that point, which is one that I meant to mention but which clearly got lost in my notes. It is important because of its impact on tenements, tower blocks and other high-rise buildings.<br><br>
My next point concerns the introduction of heating controls, which is the fourth proposed change. Heating controls are being included in energy efficiency schemes, even though I understand there has been no consultation on them. Local authorities, private sector landlords and housing associations are concerned that extra heating controls could invalidate the maintenance agreements for heating systems that they have reached and that the money for heating controls will have to come from the money that previously was used for insulation.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to make a number of commitments. First, is he prepared to listen to the points about the excellent energy efficiency schemes that have been made to me, to many other hon. Members, to the all-party group and more widely? Will he support further consultation on the proposed changes? I realise that there has been some delay in the implementation of the measures. They were due to come into effect in April and will now do so in July. It is clear that more time is needed for full discussion and consultation on them. Does the Minister know when the statutory instrument that will bring about the changes is intended to come into effect?<br><br>
Secondly, does the Minister agree that it is important to retain a combination of draught proofing and insulation for homes if we are successfully to reduce fuel poverty and ensure that people have decent, warm homes?<br><br>
Thirdly, will the Minister support the retention of a separate grant for energy advice, so that schemes such as SCARF can continue the excellent work that they provide to all sections of the community? Will he also support greater consultation with local authorities about some of the measures that the Government have introduced?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
Would the Minister and his Government be prepared to consider abandoning, for the time being, the inclusion of heat control as a measure in 1997? Is the Minister willing to support longer time scales to ensure that the skills training required to implement the new changes can be carried out?<br><br>
Finally, I praise once again the many who work to provide decent warm homes for all the people who live in our communities. We all hope that one day in the not-too-distant future the awful, hellish living conditions of those who are trapped in damp, cold housing will become a thing of the past.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire) on securing the Adjournment debate. I agree with her that home energy efficiency is an important subject. But any account of what the Government do to promote energy efficiency in the home would be incomplete if it referred only to the Scottish Office. Various parts of the Government and other agencies are also involved. The Department of the Environment is responsible for the home energy efficiency scheme, with advice and input from the Scottish Office. That Department's energy and efficiency office is responsible for various national publicity campaigns.<br><br>
The Energy Savings Trust has sizeable resources to promote energy efficiency. It has run successful campaigns to encourage take-up of ideas such as energy-efficient light bulbs and fridges, and it is promoting cavity wall insulation with a cash back offer to owner-occupiers. It is also responsible for ATC action, which supports the Home Conservation Act 1996, and one local authority of Scotland has already been a substantial beneficiary. The standards of performance allowance for the electricity industry has enabled power companies to promote energy efficiency in the home.<br><br>
All those schemes have been successful, and have benefited Scotland. Their range and diversity demonstrate clearly the Government's commitment to improving the energy efficiency of homes. In the past five years, the Scottish Office has enabled local authorities to spend more than £2 million on works to their own stock. Between 1991–95, local authorities reportedly carried out projects involving the insulation of some 31,500 homes. They installed central heating in more than 73,000 homes and have carried out 106,000 window and/or door replacements. Those works were in addition to the comprehensive modernisation of more than 40,000 houses. That is a substantial achievement; I hope that local authorities will do what they can to build on it, and that Opposition Members will congratulate them on that.<br><br>
Energy efficiency can often be improved by simple measures such as draught proofing, and loft, tank and pipe insulation. The home energy efficiency scheme has helped to improve many houses in Scotland for pensioners and others on low incomes. The scheme is administered nationally by the Department of the Environment, and the Scottish Office liaises closely with the Department to ensure that the scheme best meets the needs of the people of Scotland and that we receive our full share of the available resources.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
Since the home energy efficiency scheme began in 1991, more than 218,000 houses in Scotland have benefited from it, and more than £29 million has been spent in Scotland. The budget for next year has been increased by about 3 per cent. to just over £75 million. Since July 1996, when a network installer was appointed for the Western Isles, all of Scotland has been covered. The scope of the grant scheme is shortly to be widened so that assistance will be available for cavity wall insulation and to upgrade central heating controls. Those changes will be introduced from 1 July and will make the scheme more responsive to individual needs.<br><br>
I must also mention the assistance that is available under the improvement and repairs grant system for those in the private sector. More than £300 million has been spent over the past three years. Not all the money spent on improvement grants will have gone on works to rid homes of dampness and to make them more energy efficient, but many people are more comfortable today because of the help they have received through those grants.<br><br>
The Home Conservation Act 1996 is possibly the most important development of recent years for the promotion of energy efficiency and comfort in the home. It came into force in Scotland on 1 December last year. The Act requires local authorities to assess the energy efficiency of all homes in their area, and to draw up strategies for improving it. They have been set a target of improving it by some 30 per cent. That should result in warmth at lower cost for a large number of people, and should also result in substantially reduced emissions of CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub -->. The Government hope that most authorities will show substantial progress towards this goal over the next 10 to 15 years. Local authorities will have to look for partners and consider how they can work with others, particularly in the private sector, to reach the growing number of owner-occupiers.<br><br>
I was pleased to learn that here in Angus, the council, working with Scottish Hydro-Electric, was successful in its bid for a grant in the first year of the action programme. I understand that it was awarded £314,000 to target house movers in the private sector by way of estate agents, using questionnaires and loans from mortgage lenders.<br><br>
I also understand that Angus council will receive a further grant of £67,000 for a scheme targeted at the fuel poor and the private rented sector. The scheme includes energy education and the installation of advanced electric heating and insulation. Funds will also come from the standards of performance allowance and private landlords.<br><br>
The scheme underpins one of the key priorities for housing investment—dealing with condensation and dampness. It also provides the opportunity to try to involve private capital, which reflects the approach promoted under the private finance initiative. The challenge to local authorities is to integrate the scheme with other strands of policy and to work with others to achieve the objective that has been set.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
Any policy to improve energy efficiency must be concerned mainly with the existing housing stock, but we must also consider houses of the future. New houses are governed by the building regulations. The Government intend shortly to amend the regulations to improve energy efficiency. Those amendments will be comprehensive and will cover the insulation of the building fabric, air infiltration, control of heating systems and an energy rating system. The new regulations will require better sealing of buildings to control warm air loss and cold air infiltration. There will also be further measures governing the efficient use of heating systems. Those measures may seem small, but, taken together, they can have a dramatic effect on energy conservation.<br><br>
The new regulations will also contain a notable addition to the requirements for housing by introducing the standard assessment procedure for calculating energy efficiency ratings. That will inform householders of the overall energy efficiency of a house in a way that is simple and easy to understand.<br><br>
Under the revised regulations, a standard assessment procedure rating must be calculated for every new home. The Government hope that those ratings will enable the public to compare alternative house designs in terms of energy costs and that market forces will eventually lead to the rating scheme being extended to existing homes. That revision of the building regulations will provide the most comprehensive set of energy measures yet introduced in Scotland.<br><br>
I do not have time to mention the work that has been done in the planning field to encourage energy efficiency, or the report on good practice produced by the Scottish Office for local authorities. I hope that I have shown the range of the Government's activities in promoting home energy conservation, but we are not complacent and much remains to be done. The results of the 1996 Scottish house condition survey will be published in September and that will show whether we are on the right track. We shall take stock when we have that report and I assure the hon. Lady that our commitment to improve energy efficiency will remain.</span></p>
