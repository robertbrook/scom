	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With permission, Mr Maxton, I should like to make a further statement about the E. coli food poisoning outbreak in central Scotland. Copies of the statement are available in the Members' Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I and my colleagues at the Scottish Office would like to extend our deepest sympathy to the bereaved families and to express our sincere hope that those who are currently ill will make a swift recovery. I am sure that the entire Committee will join me in those sentiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the most serious outbreak of E. coli food poisoning that we have faced in the United Kingdom. The latest information I have is that nine people have died, with 388 suspected cases, 205 confirmed cases and 50 people in hospital. The condition of 30 people is giving cause for concern. The chief medical officer has informed me that, on the basis of the data collected to date the outbreak peaked between 20 and 26 November and that the daily number of new cases has fallen consistently since that time. It is still possible that a small number of patients may yet come forward with symptoms and we must all exercise care with food preparation and hygiene. All the epidemiological evidence points to the recent outbreak having one source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must acknowledge the immense amount of work that has been put into the outbreak by the North Lanarkshire council through its environmental health department, the Lanarkshire health board, by the Falkirk council and the Forth Valley health board and by the hospitals, community health services and general practitioners. I visited Monklands general hospital last Monday and was impressed by the dedication and commitment shown by the staff there, which I am sure is replicated in the other centres handling the outbreak. I gave an undertaking then that Lanarkshire health board would receive an additional allocation to take account of the extra demands being placed upon it. I can tell the Committee today that the same will apply to the Forth Valley health board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the outbreak began, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service has provided more than 600 units of frozen plasma for use in treating E. coli patients. The SNBTS has responded marvellously, as it always does, in meeting the blood supply needs of hospitals. However, this outbreak underlines the continuing need for fresh blood supplies. There is a mobile blood transfusion unit parked outside with a team of nurses. Hon. Members might like to join the public in taking the opportunity to donate blood or to sign up to be added to the donor register during our meeting this morning. By registering, people enable the service to call them in as and when needed, and this is particularly important. I am delighted
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
to be able to tell the Committee that the Opposition party leaders and myself will be setting an example after the statements have been completed. I apologise in advance for our absence from the Committee for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedures followed during the food poisoning outbreak reflect a long-established view that responsibility should lie with the local authority environmental health department. This is enshrined in the Food Safety Act 1990 and its associated Great Britain-wide code of practice, and in the guidance published by the Scottish Office Department of Health. The Bill, which became the 1990 Act, had all-party support and was passed unopposed. The code of practice made under it was the subject of extensive consultation and was laid before Parliament. There should thus be no dispute in this Committee that it is right that statutory responsibility for food safety enforcement should rest with local authorities. The Secretary of State has reserve powers, which could effectively replace the local authority in handling an outbreak of this nature. At no stage in this outbreak has anyone suggested that use of those powers would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of information supplied to my officials, I understand the sequence of events in the present outbreak to be as follows. Information that this was indeed an E. coli outbreak became available around midday on Friday 22 November, in the light of reported cases of illness and tests on patients becoming ill over the previous few days. Investigation to trace the possible source of infection established by the end of that day that food supplied from the premises of J. Barr and Son was the probable source. Officers from the environmental health department of the council and the health board spoke to Mr. Barr that same evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been informed that those officers told Mr. Barr that they thought the infection was coming from his shop and obtained his agreement that he would withdraw from sale all cooked meats and cooked meat products with immediate effect. I also understand that they also visited early the following morning at 7am, before the shop opened, to confirm this position and they decided that it was not necessary to impose a statutory prohibition on trading. It has, however, become clear that cooked meat did leave Mr. Barr's premises that day. The circumstances in which that meat was supplied are being investigated by the police and I do not propose to risk compromising that process by commencing further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority was responsible for tracing others who might possibly be at risk of infection, through a process of identifying and interviewing Mr. Barr's customers. They have explained to my officials that this was not an easy process, not least because the shopkeeper's records made it very difficult to produce an accurate or reliable list. The availability of adequate information is something which the police are investigating; it was not until Friday 6 December that it was possible for the local authority environmental health department to complete the task of checking through all the customer records for the relevant period as far back as the beginning of November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The set procedures require the establishment of an outbreak control team to co-ordinate all activities during the release of information. It met for the first time at 11 am on Saturday 23 November and by that afternoon, general practitioners had been alerted, the arrangements for a helpline established and a press notice issued.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
That achieved extensive coverage, and there were, for example, 350 inquiries on the helpline the following day. Meanwhile, the health authorities and local practitioners were gearing up to cope with the expected influx of cases, with all the associated testing, interviewing and checking requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken time to explain these events carefully so that the Committee will understand the extent of the action taken locally. On Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Scottish Office officials spoke to the local officials involved. On Tuesday 26 November, my officials contacted the Lanarkshire and Forth Valley health boards. Prompted by information from the latter of suspected cases of eating cold meat from Scotmid stores, and by media reports that morning, my officials sought urgent information on the extent of the outbreak beyond North Lanarkshire. My officials were not able to get a response from North Lanarkshire council either by telephone-which was engaged-or by fax, but they were able to confirm with the Edinburgh environmental health department that information had been provided to a number of adjacent environmental health departments about outlets beyond North Lanarkshire. My officials therefore urgently arranged to attend the meeting in Hamilton on the evening of Tuesday 26 November, at which they were briefed on the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the outbreak, my officials decided that a food hazard warning notice should be issued to all environmental health departments in Scotland, in accordance with the procedures laid down in the code of practice. Its purpose was twofold: first, to alert all local authorities in Scotland to the outbreak, to ensure that if potentially contaminated products were found to be distributed outside the affected area they would know what action to take; and secondly, to confirm to enforcement authorities in the central belt that products may have been distributed to outlets in their area, so that they could investigate and, if necessary, withdraw from sale. It has since been established that Lanarkshire had contacted other food authorities directly and action was already under-way. The food hazard warning is a document that positively requires action by enforcement officers of food authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My officials sent the draft by fax to officials of North Lanarkshire council who were present at the control team meeting on Wednesday 27 November and my officials were told by the council that details of the network of outlets should be described as confidential. The initiative to restrict the availability of the list of outlets appended to the food hazard warning in that way did not come from the Scottish Office, as I have already told the House and I hope that Opposition Members now accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second food hazard warning notice was issued on Thursday 28 November, asking enforcement officers to take action to remind butchers and other premises selling or processing raw and cooked meats of the need for them to implement the highest level of hygiene on their premises and to follow the published advice contained in the document, "Safer Cooked Meat Production Guidelines".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, officials have met with senior representatives of the Scottish Federation of Meat Traders Associations to advise them of the details of the outbreak
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
and to encourage a campaign of good hygiene practice. The federation, in conjunction with the Meat and livestock Commission, is offering all independent butchers in Scotland a free advisory visit to assist them in identifying the points that are critical in the control of food safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I announced on 29 November, I have invited Professor Pennington to lead an expert group. The expert group's remit is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to examine the circumstances which led to the outbreak in the central belt of Scotland and to advise me on the implications for food safety and the general lessons to be learned."</p></blockquote>
I have asked Professor Pennington to let me have any priority recommendations he wishes to make by the end of this year. I have also asked the chief medical officer to prepare an advertising campaign to inform the public, shopkeepers, the catering trade and those responsible for processing food, of good practice designed to minimise the risk of food poisoning. As members of the Committee will have seen, that campaign, costing more than £600,000, has begun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate announced on Thursday a public inquiry under the Fatal Accident and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 to investigate the circumstances and causes of deaths caused by the outbreak. The inquiry is public, has a wide-ranging remit and is entitled to explore and determine the reasonable precautions, if any, whereby the deaths might have been avoided; the defects, if any, of any system of working which contributed to the deaths; and, any other facts that are relevant to the circumstances of the deaths. The sheriff conducting the inquiry will have extensive powers to call witnesses and order the recovery of documents. All interested parties, including the families of the deceased, will have the right to give evidence and be represented by lawyers at the inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must emphasise that, contrary to what we have heard in recent days, a fatal accident inquiry is as powerful a means of investigating an incident such as this as any other public inquiry. It has been able to handle incidents as significant and diverse as Lockerbie and the Ibrox disaster and is commonly used in medical cases. The Committee should have every confidence that it is entirely appropriate to tackle the circumstances of this outbreak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any such outbreak involving illness and death is harrowing for those directly affected and their relatives and, indeed, for all those involved. It is with sadness that I must tell the Committee that, even as I speak, the number of deaths has increased by one—unfortunately, another person has died at Stobhill hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I close by reminding the committee not to lose sight of the immense effort made by many dedicated people in dealing with the consequences of the outbreak and tracking down its causes. They deserve our thanks and support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that further, lengthy statement on E. coli food poisoning in central Scotland and for supplying me with a copy of it in advance. I join him in expressing our profound and sincere condolences to the bereaved and their families and our sympathy and good wishes to those who have fallen ill with this foul bacteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, offer my gratitude and admiration to all those in Monklands, Law and all the other hospitals who have been overwhelmed in recent days and to all the health
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
service staff, the Lanarkshire health board, North Lanarkshire council, Forth Valley health board, the general practitioners, community health staff and all the emergency services, which have been stretched to almost superhuman levels in dealing with the human consequences of the awful outbreak. We owe them all, and those like them, very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the Secretary of State that in this part of the world—in Lanarkshire—there is still confusion, worry and anxiety. There is also a real and genuine anger about how the affliction came about and critical aspects of how it was handled. It is not point scoring to demand to know whether E. coli research is adequate or whether it was cut when it was needed. It is not party politicking to ask who was in charge of a crisis that moved so fast, so lethally and so far into the communities of central Scotland. It is not scapegoating to expect Ministers to accept or to share responsibility for handling a food-poisoning outbreak of proportions unprecedented in recent times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may bridle at every criticism that is made of him and blame everyone else for what has happened, but heaping all responsibility on local agencies when, as he says his Department was involved right from the beginning is undignified, improper and scarcely convincing, so I ask him some detailed and critical questions on what he said today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Scottish Office was informed on Friday 22 November of an impending crisis. Was the Scottish Office Minister responsible for health told on that day and if not, why not? Secondly, on the Saturday and Sunday, it was clear that an emergency was developing, stretching well beyond North Lanarkshire. Scotmid stores in Bonnybridge had been identified by the 	<i>Sunday Mail.</i> On the Monday, Forth Valley health board had contacted that company and, bizarrely, told them in the afternoon to send out a press release, but only to the 	<i>Daily Express.</i> As it was obvious then that E. coli was not confined within one local council or health board boundary, why was the Scottish Office not represented on the outbreak control team until the Tuesday evening?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, why was the Scottish office Minister responsible for health not officially told of the calamitous spread of the illness until the Monday morning—three days after it had started? Had he not read any newspapers, heard any broadcasts or watched television during that weekend. Did he not hear that Monklands hospital had been preparing since the Saturday for hundreds of cases, including possible fatalities? Did Minister consider it simply a local issue, and not one of great concern nationally?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the Minister told me in a letter that I received late on Friday night that he was fully briefed early on the Monday morning and on each day after about what was happening in the E. coli crisis. He must, therefore, have known about the agonised debate among members of the outbreak control team on whether to release the list of affected outlets and how the Scottish Office guidelines under the Food Safety Act 1990 were placing a restraint on what the authorities could say. What ministerial advice did he give? Did he agree with officials about keeping from the public the information about where affected meat might be on sale?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the daily briefings given to the Minister of State and the growing storm from Members of Parliament and the press, why did not the Secretary of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
State become aware of the row about releasing the outlet information until 7 o'clock on the Wednesday evening, five days after the crisis began? Did he not read a newspaper, hear a radio programme or watch television during the whole week? Given that the Health Minister was being briefed in detail from the Monday morning, that officials were in touch from the Friday on which the outbreak began, and that the Scottish Office itself sent out the food hazard warning on 26 November, how is it that when I asked the Secretary of State in the House of Commons,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Was the Scottish Office behind the decision to withhold information about outlets?"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 28 	<i>November 1996; Vol. 286, c.467.</i>]</p></blockquote>
he replied "No, it was not"? Was not that answer implausible and indefensible now that we know what he has told us today? Why does the Secretary of State insist on hiding behind the role of the local council when the outbreak was so serious and responsibility had, by definition, to be, and was, being shared by all the authorities, including his Dept?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has set up two inquiries. Professor Pennington has an expert group investigating all the circumstances and we wish it well. But does he not recognised that if Mr. Stephen Rook from the Scottish Office—the signatory to the food hazard warning issued on 26 November—is to be a full member of that inquiry, there will be a credibility problem that will affect the public's attitude to the inquiry's outcome? Is the right hon. Gentleman genuinely satisfied that a conventional fatal accident inquiry that is unlikely to begin its deliberations until January is sufficient to tackle an outbreak that is still claiming casualties, at a time when public confidence has urgently to be restored, and cannot be until the people know whom they can trust? It is critical that confidence in all agencies concerned with food safety and public health be restored, but this cannot properly happen if the public do not know all the facts and are confused about responsibilities. The public in this and the wider area have the right to have their health and safety protected. Public confidence must therefore have priority over all other considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that we should have used our default powers to take over responsibility from the North Lanarkshire authority and substitute for the environmental health officer and Scottish Office officials. I do not believe that that would have been appropriate and I see no evidence that the local environmental health officer and his team have done anything other than an excellent job in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about E. coli research. We are spending approximately £2.4 million. There are four projects in Scotland. If Professor Pennington, who is the foremost authority on this bacterium, recommends further research, I shall certainly ensure that that is carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked who was in charge. The 1990 Act and the code of practice make it absolutely clear that in these circumstances the local authority is in charge, together with the local outbreak control team, which was established on Saturday. He also asked about the involvement of the Scottish Office and why an announcement was delayed. The Scottish Office becomes involved, as the hon. Gentleman will realise, only when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
it is apparent that the outbreak has spread beyond a given area. The hon. Gentleman has made the same point twice. He will not accept that we did not decide not to reveal the names of the outlets and keep that confidential. I suggest that I make available to members of the Committee the correspondence with the Lanarkshire authority, including the faxes and the drafts. He will see that the original drafts do not contain a confidentiality requirement: this was added subsequently, as a result of consulting the local authority. I shall also make available the letter sent to the local authority by Mr. Rook informing it that he had failed to contact its officials by telephone and that they had not responded to his fax, and pointing out the duties that lay on the local authority to inform the Scottish Office as soon as the outbreak spread. I make no criticism of that delay because I realise that the local authority had to deal with the crisis and that its officials had contacted the other groups independently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about the position of Mr. Rook in the group of experts. It is unacceptable for the hon. Gentleman to attack the integrity and trustworthiness of officials. Mr. Rook is an expert whose presence among the group was requested by Professor Pennington, who is independent and thinks that he should be there. I see no reason why the hon. Gentleman should be involved. When he has seen the correspondence, I hope that he will have the grace to apologise for some of his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman described the fatal accident inquiry as a conventional fatal accident inquiry. I do not know what that means. One of the glories of Scotland's law is the fatal accident inquiry procedure, because of its flexibility. The Lord Advocate, as the senior Law Officer in Scotland, has said that that procedure will enable us to do everything that any other form of public inquiry can do. I therefore think that it is appropriate to proceed. Police investigations will lead to proceedings. Professor Pennington's review will be carried out with urgency and there will be the fatal accident inquiry. A further public inquiry would add unnecessarily to the burden on the people who will have to prepare and give evidence. We must, of course, get to the bottom of what happened, but this is not a subject for now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about restoring public confidence. I have complete confidence in the North Lanarkshire local authority and its work and in the Lanarkshire health board. The best way of ensuring public confidence would be for the hon. Gentleman to stop issuing press releases that snipe at people who are trying to do their best in extremely difficult circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Jeremy Bray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State may not be aware that Mr. Jim Davidson, the minister of the Wishaw Old Parish Church spoke for the majority of people in Wishaw when he told me yesterday that the one thing that we could do today was ask for a public inquiry. The public are familiar with the fatal accident inquiry procedures because there have been all too many of them recently in Motherwell and Wishaw. But is such an inquiry as relevant and effective as is necessary to probe the extraordinarily personal and complex explanations behind what happened?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that at no stage in the investigation into the outbreak had anyone asked him to use his overriding powers. I believe that that is correct.
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The right hon. Gentleman will recall, however, that I spoke to his office on the afternoon of Wednesday 27 November asking that the outlets be named and that the Scottish Office intervene because I had spoken to local authority and health board officials and was aware of their attitude. He is aware that his letter, for which I am grateful, made no mention of disclosure of names of outlets. After reading it, I spoke to his principal private secretary, asking that overriding statutory powers not be used because they seemed simply irrelevant in the urgency of what was facing us, but that the outlets be named forthwith. The names were released at 10 o'clock that evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, the important issues are not who said what to whom at what time, but the underlying problems in food hygiene in Lanarkshire and far more widely in Scotland and providing an explanation of what happened and how to avoid a recurrence. That will help to show whether there has been a massive breakdown in public confidence in the food hygiene system, and whether the initiative taken by the Lanarkshire health board in issuing a leaflet on Saturday, and the publication of a statement—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am reluctant in the circumstances to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but several hon. Members wish to ask questions. I should be grateful if he would keep his questions brief. I make the same plea to other hon. Members whom I may call.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Maxton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is such that important questions must be asked. What food is safe to eat? Where can we obtain it? How can we be reassured about outlets? Understanding the answers will require a major public education campaign. Is the Secretary of State prepared to ensure that that comes about because the problem has not yet been tackled on the scale called for, given the long-term and large-scale nature of the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his last point the hon. Gentleman made a positive suggestion, which I am happy to take on board in the light of Professor Pennington's recommendation and will draw to the professor's attention. I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for the courteous way in which he has maintained contact with my office. I hope that we have responded positively. He did indeed contact my office on the Wednesday. As I said, I was first made aware by officials through my private office at 7 o'clock that evening that the list of names being kept confidential. I responded by stating that I was not at all happy about that. I asked whose decision it was and was informed that it had been taken locally. I inquired whether I had powers to intervene and asked for advice. The hon. Gentleman is aware that we have draconian powers, which involve substituting completely for a local authority in some circumstances, or acting when a local authority is in default. Neither circumstances applied. The local authority made a judgment on the basis of guidelines. We may need to reconsider them and their interpretation. They were consulted on and laid before the House and no one objected to them, but they certainly should be looked at again. There is no question but that lessons need to be learnt; the expert group and the fatal accident inquiry will examine this issue.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of the minister in Wishaw calling for a public inquiry. I understand that. The FAI is a public inquiry. I do not know what I can say to the hon. Gentleman other than that the Law Officers have assured me that the public inquiry will be able to deal with all these matters in detail. At the end of the process, it may be thought that further action is required. If it is, we shall consider that at the time. The FAI will provide the means of examining the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about conversations with my office and the change made later that evening. The advice given to me was that my own expression of concern had no bearing whatever on the decision taken locally subsequently to publish the list. I had no influence of any kind there—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In view of the fact that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) is not standing, I call the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As at least three people from the Bonnybridge and Banknock areas in my constituency have died from the E. coli infection, may I express my deepest sympathy to the bereaved families and wish a speedy recovery to those still being treated in hospital or at home? I also pay tribute to the excellent work of the staff at Falkirk and District royal infirmary, where about one-third of the hospitalised patients are being treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does not the Secretary of State accept that growing public concern demands the highest form of public judicial inquiry with the power to summon witnesses—including Scottish Office Ministers and officials, if necessary—and investigate all the circumstances of this fatal outbreak? It should be able to investigate reports that, by Saturday 23 November, health officials had a list of Scotmid shops in the Bonnybridge area that John Barr's supplied. Scotmid was, however, not officially told of that until the following Monday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman cannot reply. If he could however, tell me what a public inquiry could do that a fatal accident inquiry could not, I would be prepared to reconsider the position. He mentioned two specific issues. The first was the power to summon witnesses, including Ministers, but the fatal accident inquiry will have that power. The second was the power to investigate all the circumstances, but the inquiry will have that power, too. Victims' families and others will be able to guarantee the cross-examination and investigation of all aspects of the case through their lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Dunblane, we established a public inquiry procedure under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921. The only difference between such procedures and the fatal accident inquiry procedure that will be required in this case is that a High Court judge would chair an inquiry under the 1921 Act, while the sheriff principal would chair the fatal accident inquiry. That is the only distinction that I have found, and it would not justify a further inquiry given that the matter can be dealt with under the FAI procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that people are still ill as a result of this serious outbreak and that it is, therefore, unwise to spread
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
stories that have little factual basis? Three members of my family have been very ill with food poisoning in the past two weeks. I know, therefore, that people are terribly worried by the misinformation that has been spread by those who do not respect the facts and that we must tackle the problem if we are to restore public confidence. The fatal accident inquiry, with all the powers that it has, will produce the answers. Only when we have those can we assess and judge the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are legitimate reasons for concern. People have made judgments that, with the benefit of hindsight, may not have been the best. We should, however, recognise that everyone involved has done their best in unprecedentedly difficult circumstances. When we rake over the background to these events, we will find that there are lessons to be learnt. The Committee and the House will have to consider whether we need to amend legislation, regulations or procedures, but that is something for the future. I am sure that such decisions are best taken with a full and certain knowledge of the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Reid 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I offer my condolences to the families of the bereaved and my thanks to the local health board and local authorities for their action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does not the Secretary of State realise that, for two reasons, public fears will be allayed only by a full public inquiry? First, such an inquiry would benefit from the status of a High Court judge. Secondly, the two other inquiries will concentrate on the medical causes of the outbreak and fatalities. Public concern has, however, been expressed about the handling of the crisis after the outbreak. People recognise that local health officials do not work in a vacuum, but under Government guidelines, regulations and specific instructions. There is a widespread feeling about the public that the guidelines have placed commercial interests above the public's interests and right to information. We need, therefore, to examine whether producer and consumer interests should be separated, whether we need a food standards agency and whether the present guidelines overemphasise the interests of the producer at the expense of those of the public. Those issues and questions can be dealt with only after an investigation into the handling of the crisis and a full and open public inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat the challenge that I gave to the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan)—will the hon. Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid) say what a public inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 could do that a fatal accident inquiry could not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has picked up the information that I gave to members of the Committee about the sheriff principal and the High Court judge. He made a specific assertion that an inquiry under the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 would not be able to investigate the other circumstances in terms of procedures. If he cares to check 	<i>Hansard,</i> he will see that I said that a fatal accident inquiry would be able to consider the defects, if any, of any system of working that contributed to the deaths and any other facts which are relevant to the circumstances of the deaths. It would be essential for the FAI to examine all those factors, for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman set out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I join with the hon. Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid) in expressing sympathy for the growing number of bereaved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Secretary of State confirm that even before the tragedy in Lanarkshire and the Forth valley, Scotland had the highest incidence of E. coli 0157 in Europe? We have a particular problem in Scotland, which seems to be based on the behaviour of the bacterium in its natural reservoir in the animal herd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, is not it extraordinary that the total research funding over the past six years in Scotland from the Secretary of State's Department is just over £500,000 and that one of the research teams that was turned down for funding was that of Professor Pennington's team in Aberdeen? That amount is half of a week's national lottery jackpot—a very small amount of money. It is less than the amount about which the Secretary of State made a welcome announcement today in response to this outbreak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will he assure us that, after the outbreak, in future, research teams in Scotland, which has some of the finest bacteriologists in the world, will be given the funding required to eliminate that deadly bacterium from the Scottish food chain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman left out the research that has been commissioned by Government Departments other than the Scottish Office, which have the lead role in commissioning research. If he had included that, he would have told the Committee that the amount being spent on research was more then £2 million. I know that that was an oversight on his part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether projects in Scotland are funded is determined on advice from experts who consider the merits of a project as well as the overall resources available for budgeting. As the hon. Gentleman will know, after the controversy over Torry, which I inherited when I arrived at the Scottish Office, I insisted on research jobs being maintained here in Scotland through the research consortium rather than being transferred to York, which had been the position. I repeat what I said: if Professor Pennington comes forward with research that is relevant to the E. coli situation and makes recommendations for public health as a result of his inquiry, I will make it my business to see that they are supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 18 projects in train, of which five are in Scotland. They cover the broad range of research needs that are related to E. coli 0157. The hon. Gentleman is right—there is a higher incidence of E. coli in Scotland. No one knows why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the research?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked my officials whether we should commission a research project to find out the answer. The professional advice that I received was that the other on-going work will enable us to make some progress with the answer to that question, and that what the hon. Gentleman and I might see as a commonsense approach is rather naive. There is no one who does not want to find an answer to the question, and it would be wrong for the hon. Gentleman to misrepresent—although I know that he did not intend to do so—the scale of research that is going on throughout Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend's statement is both comprehensive and welcome. I join with the condolences to the bereaved that have been expressed, and with the tributes to the many people who have worked so hard after the appalling outbreak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend has, rightly and properly, announced two inquiries: the fatal accident inquiry and Professor Pennington's inquiry. There is a clear need to restore public confidence. I realise that my right hon. Friend cannot give a definitive answer, but can he tell us the likely time scale before the two inquiries report and hon. Members are able to consider the results of their deliberations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend asks me a rather difficult question. I have asked Professor Pennington to let me have any key or urgent recommendations before the end of the year—a matter of weeks. I expect to have his full report early in the new year and I know that he and his colleagues will move as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the fatal accident inquiry—which is a matter for the Lord Advocate—is held may be influenced by whether there are any criminal proceedings, and that is not a matter on which I can comment. The same would apply to any public inquiry under any legislation. Criminal proceedings may delay an inquiry, but that would be a matter for the Lord Advocate. I know that he fully understands the public interest in this matter. Professor Pennington's group will, meanwhile, proceed at a pace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Public Expenditure</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>11.17 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With permission, Mr. Maxton, I wish to make a statement about public expenditure in Scotland. Copies of my statement are available in the Members' Room. A table summarising my decisions will also be available and will appear in the 	<i>Official Report.</i> Full details will be published in March in my departmental report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have set the control total for public expenditure next year at £266 billion. Our success in controlling inflation has enabled us to release savings from previous plans. At the same time, we will sustain and improve public services at reduced cost to the taxpayer. The block and formula arrangements remain in place and will continue to maintain Scotland's favourable position in the Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office budget of £14.3 billion for next year represents more than £2,700 for every person in Scotland. That is a third higher than in England. It is my task under the block arrangements to allocate Scottish expenditure according to Scottish needs. To do that most effectively I have consulted a wide range of interested bodies. I had particularly useful discussions with the Scottish Economic Council. As a result of those deliberations I have decided that my priorities this year will be the health of the people of Scotland, their protection from crime, their education and the encouragement of enterprise to create jobs and the wealth needed to underpin these essential services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Not on a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good try.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Support for health and for local government are the two biggest block programmes. I make no apology for favouring health. The NHS is achieving efficiency savings of more than 2 per cent. year after year, and will reduce management and administration costs this year by 5 per cent. realising £18 million for patient care. Further savings in management costs of health boards should bring a reduction of 33 per cent. over the next two years. We have yet to see a similar shift in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am adding £148 million to planned expenditure on health. That means that for next year the health budget will be almost £4.4 billion—a real-terms increase of 1.5 per cent. That builds on the successive real-terms increases of previous years. Since 1979, The Government have increased spending on health in Scotland by more than 57 per cent. in real terms—153 per cent. in cash terms—and are committed to maintaining those real increases over the next three years and, indeed, for the whole of the next Parliament. I look forward to the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) giving the same commitment this morning, for the Leader of the Opposition indicated that he would match any spending commitment on health which the Government made. Those increases have led to concrete improvements. Treatment of patients in acute specialities has increased by 3.5 per cent. per year over the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Next year, spending on health will amount to a record £850 per person in Scotland, which is 22 per cent. higher than in England. Each health board will receive a real terms increase in funding. That will allow an extra 40,000 patients to be treated in hospital. The health service will continue to make progress on all our health priorities, targeting the major problem areas of heart disease, cancer and mental health. Over the next three years, I expect more than £500 million of private money to be invested in health projects through the private finance initiative, notably in four major hospitals in Lothian and in Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service must prepare carefully for the increased demand in winter. I have been assured that it has done so, but am today releasing a further £15 million to support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My budget for law and order next year is £478 million. That is £20 million higher than expected this year. I am determined to go on backing the fight against crime. The police are in the front line of our efforts. My commitment last year to put 500 extra police officers on the beat should now be fulfilled a year earlier than planned, with 187 new officers on front-line duty next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
High technology is the key to the prevention and detection of serious crime. I am providing more funding for projects such as the National Criminal Intelligence Service and research and development on handwriting analysis. The fight against terrorism must also continue and I am strengthening the police presence at ferry terminals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Funding for the Scottish Prison Service will increase by more than 5 per cent. next year to enable it to meet the demands placed upon it. I have also allowed specifically for £12 million to introduce mandatory drug testing in prisons, to improve rehabilitation and to tackle offending behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further increases in the fire service capital programme will enable a number of significant projects to proceed, including major works at Falkirk, Lothian and the Borders. I am pleased to announce that I have also made more than £1 million available to improve facilities at the Scottish fire services training school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have provided for an increase of £6.6 million over the next three years for social work in support of the criminal justice system. That will allow nationwide coverage of schemes to keep fine defaulters out of prison and the establishment of a new bail hostel in Dundee by next summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For education, planned spending next year is more than £1.4 billion. In higher education, the trends for Scotland are very encouraging. Since 1979, the number of publicly funded students in our universities and colleges has almost doubled. Unit costs have been reduced by about a third. Yet the institutions have maintained the quality of their teaching and research. I am therefore backing them and responding to requests I have received from that sector by providing an extra £10 million next year. That will maintain the real value of their funding for teaching and research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere in education I have provided new funds for capital in further education colleges, particularly for information technology. I am setting aside additional
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
funds for the completion of the higher still programme, and for full implementation of our major and very popular initiative on nursery education. Pilot schemes have proved successful—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] Well, parents think so. More than 97 per cent. of eligible parents have claimed vouchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have allocated nearly £600 million for industry, enterprise and training next year. Scottish Enterprise has delivered on its commitment to maintain its outputs this year with lower resources. Indeed, this has been a year of record achievements. I have been able to meet its request and increase its gross budget by £30 million—£10 million this year and £20 million next—so that it can attract yet further inward investment, and maintain its programmes of assistance for indigenous businesses. I have also been able to meet Highlands and Island Enterprise's request for a 2 per cent. real increase in its budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On housing, I have for the second year running left unchanged the net provision for local authorities' capital spending on their housing stock. That provides significant resources for local authority housing and councils will be able to spend substantially more per council house next year than is the case in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must pay off Scottish Homes debt of £390 million over the next four years, using its receipts from disposals. I have made an additional £43 million available to Scottish Homes over the next 16 months, including £20 million in the current year. That will allow a substantial development programmed to be maintained in 1997–98. It will also be sufficient to ensure the completion of about 8,000 new and improved units in that year. Public resources are not, of course, the only input in securing improvement to the housing stock. Private finance is an increasingly important element, contributing some £180 million this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the extent of rough sleeping in Scotland and I am putting £15 million over the next three years into a new challenge fund to tackle the problem. There should be no need for anyone to sleep rough in this country and this initiative will go a long way to help some of the most disadvantaged people in our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had to make reductions in my trunk road programme. Nevertheless, over the next years we plan for central Government to invest some £560 million in Scotland's transport infrastructure, and that is only part of the picture. We expect the private finance initiative to allow a further £260 million to be spent on major roads in the same period by the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We plan to use private finance to upgrade the final sections of the A74 to motorway standard. I am also pleased to announce that tenders will be invited shortly to complete the M8 motorway between Baillieston and Newhouse. Plans for the next three years incorporate a further private finance scheme, on the final section of the M80 and four publicly funded major schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I announced on Budget day my plans for local government. Government supported expenditure will increase by £132 million and aggregate external finance by £60 million, next year. Let us not hear any talk of cuts. These are increases. This year is a generous settlement at a time when local government spends 30 per cent. more per head than in England, with central Government support 42 per cent. higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am giving particular priority to school security. I following the Cullen report seventy-five per cent. of that expenditure will be covered by a specific grant from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Scottish Office. In addition whatever funds are needed to refurbish Dunblane primary school will be made available, as the Prime Minister promised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the rest of the block I have maintained provision for the natural and built heritage, and expect the bodies involved to deliver the output demanded of them. My budget for arts and libraries is more than £80 million—an increase of £2.6 million on this year. Most of the increase will go to the Scottish Arts Council to allow implementation of the national companies' working group's recommendations. After years of uncertainty, I have secured the future of Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, the Royal Scottish National orchestra and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, provided that they implement promptly the group's recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To govern is to choose, Mr. Maxton. I have set out my priorities. I commend our proposals to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call hon. Members to speak I remind the Committee that proceeding on the statement finish at 11.45 am, so I ask that questions be brief. There is a debate on the statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that we have only limited time and that we shall have a detailed debate on Wednesday. Nevertheless, the Scottish budget outlined today in Scotland for the first time is nothing more than an elaborate con—a mixture of fake generosity and genuine pain: more tax, fewer public services, more vain promises and less credibility. It is not truly a statement, but a confession of failure after 17 years of Government mismanagement of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the heart of the Secretary of State's statement is a scandal. I cite his own words from the end of his statement when he said that to govern was to choose and that he had set out his priorities. In Scotland today, we are hearing one man's priorities and that same man's choices. He is the man who makes all the priority decisions; he even leaked them to the press on the day before he put them to the Scottish Grand Committee. He now simply seeks to defend them to the outside world—a world whose inhabitants have no chance to influence his decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that the Secretary of State and the Scottish Office are planning to reduce public spending in Scotland by more than £800 million in real terms over the next three years. That is bound to impact on services throughout Scotland. There may be priorities—in education, health, law and order and industry—with which no one would quibble. However, what is the truth behind the statistics? We have received the tables and detailed statistics only today. By Wednesday, though, we will know the stark truth hidden behind the Government statistical sleight of hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned an extra £148 million for health, but that is greatly reduced by inflation. The Labour party, of course, will honour its commitment to the health service. Tory promises about year-on-year increases in the future have as much credibility as the many other Government promises that have been broken so often in the past. The health service still carries the huge burden of red tape that was created by the internal market. We, the Labour party, will make savings and plough them back into investment in the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The Secretary of State also promised more on education, but we are hearing only about central Government expenditure. An extra £10 million for further education has suffered cuts over the past three years of 29 per cent. If local authorities have their budgets cut, education expenditure will also suffer at the local level. Provision is made in the Budget statement for a £500,000 sweetener to one individual tiny, opted-out school, which just happens to be in the Secretary of State's own constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State also promises more for industry. He is returning to Scottish Enterprise—he claims over the next two years—the money that he stole from its budget last year. That represents a humiliating U-turn on what he said last year. More money is promised for law and order and for the homeless. That is necessary to deal with the crises that the Government have created over the past 17 years. It amounts to a token effort for the homeless and massive cuts in the housing budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed figures put to us today show that £20 million is being taken out of next year's housing budget. On top of that is a draconian claw back of 75 per cent. of all council house receipts to deal with the debt burden that the Government have allowed to develop over the years. It will have a massive impact on what councils can achieve for the homeless and for repairs. It will also have a devastating effect on the building industry in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are getting more of the same: more promises that nobody believes. It is the last dying gasp of a Government who are out of time. No wonder that the people of Scotland are saying that enough is enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can debate the issues at length later so I shall not respond at length now. However, the hon. Gentleman referred to £37.5 million which he claimed was money that I stolen from Scottish Enterprise. It has maintained its output and I used that £37.5 million to support local Government, so I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should criticise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also told the Committee that a Labour Government would honour their promises and that we can all now rest because there will be a real increase in health spending year after year, throughout the whole of the PES period, because that is what I provided for. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that commitment on behalf of the opposition. [Hon. Members: "The hon. Gentleman is shaking his head." Perhaps I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman. He can clarify the point on Wednesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to planning to reduce expenditure, parties that do not vote against tax cuts cannot complain about reductions in public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is concerned about the efficient use and deployment of money in the health service. Why does not he become more innovative and allow the health trusts in negotiation with the health boards to go for roll-over budgeting? They will not then find, as has been the case in the highlands and elsewhere in Scotland, that a trust is well into the financial year before a contract is agreed and false economies have to be inflicted on staff and patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a specific plea to the Secretary of State about the disproportionate impact on all rural authorities in Scotland of his decision on capital receipts. We are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
already hearing horror about the small construction firms in the private sector that are overly dependent on local authority contracts. When they dry up, it is not just the disabled and the elderly and the elderly and other vulnerable groups that need improvements to their homes who suffer, but those in the construction section sector who find themselves out of work. These pleas come from a party that is prepared to make the case for this type of public investment by opposition in the House of Commons to Short-term, cynical and counter-productive income tax cuts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are provisions that allow roll-over funding at present, but if there is a particular problem, I shall be happy to discuss it with the hon. Gentleman, as I have some sympathy with his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to changes in receipt rules and the problems that they might cause for some authorities in respect of their existing programmes, I am happy to look at the matter. The principle of repaying the debt, which is growing inexorably and which will have an impact on future housing programmes and on rent, is one that we must take on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to consider the difficulties in the hon. Gentleman's constituency and in the highlands to see whether we can assist. The general principle must apply because we must repay some of the debt in the long-term interests of a sustainable housing programme. We have invested £11.5 billion in housing since 1979; the results are there for people to see. Of course, there is more to do, but it must e done on a sound basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend will recall opening the new section of the A77-M77 link road on Friday, which was much appreciated by my constituents and those of other Ayrshire Members. Will my right hon. Friend say when the public inquiry into the A77 upgrade between Malletshough and Fenwick will report and the upgrade will be funded, as was suggested in the past, given the suggestion of cuts in the road programme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does he also agree that the city has special needs resulting from it being Scotland's metropolitan area? In view of the serious crisis affecting the people of Glasgow, will he allocate additional resources to the city as a special case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position "the social work staff'. The extraordinary position is that a local authority was unsure how many staff it employed and overspent on that budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it the case that in 1997–98, the clawback of capital receipts from Scottish Homes will mean that it has some £74 million less to spend on housing compared with 1996–97, which will mean only 1,500 new starts? There were 4,000 in 1996–97 and 6,000 in 1995–96. Is not that a savage cut in housing? Does not it make a mockery of the grand statements made earlier about care and concern for the homeless?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right. Scottish Homes' assets do not reflect its liabilities. There is a debt of about £378 million, which must be repaid. We have suggested that it should be repaid through receipts, over a four-year period. However, as the hon. Lady may not have picked up from my statement, I am making resources available from within my block to compensate for the loss of receipts which will arise from paying off the debt. I cannot do it in full, as to do so I would have to take more money from elsewhere. There has been a substantial programme, and we will maintain a good programme in the coming years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State regards health as one of his priorities, why is he imposing an 11 per cent. cut in housing and forcing people to live longer in damp and unfit accommodation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the hon. Lady's figures. I hope that she gives us credit for having spent almost £12 billion on improving council housing and housing association housing throughout Scotland. The Government have transformed housing in Scotland; the last Labour Government were the only Government whom I can recall who made deep and substantial capital cuts, not just in housing but in health. We have delivered what we promised and I want to do more. I have a level baseline; the hon. Lady was among those who did not vote against the tax cut that supported public finance. She is, I believe, a devoted follower of new Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend my right hon. Friend for the real increases in health, education and the police service, which are all very valuable, and for the continuation of the M74 through my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As there is a real increase of more than 2 per cent., why has there been a ritual scream from all local authorities that it is not enough? Have they grossly over-budgeted for the future or is it just bad housekeeping?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The picture is mixed; £750,000 million in uncollected council tax and community charge could be obtained by the local authorities. There are also enormous opportunities for local authorities to make savings through competitive tendering and to do what Scottish Enterprise, the health service and others have done to reduce the cost of administration and bureaucracy and get more money into front-line services. Whoever forms a Government after the election will have to tackle that problem. It is costing every household in Scotland £50 a week simply to meet the grant that central Government give to local

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey (Kilmarnock and Loudon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Secretary of State answers the question of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) about the delay in the public inquiry and the extensive course of the A77, will he do me the courtesy of sending me a letter about it, as half the road is in my constituency.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to see the hon. Gentleman at the opening of the road, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr referred, in conditions of extreme cold. We wanted the hon. Gentleman to assist us in his capacity as chairman of the all-party whisky group, but he had disappeared before we could be given sustaining warmth. I am happy to write to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has any funding been allocated for the replacement of the Kincardine bridge, which everyone agrees needs to be replaced in the next three years? Does the Secretary of State, agree that his main motive in making his statement is to force councils to cut and privatise services and to offer some sweeties to the Scottish electorate? It is insulting to their intelligence if the right hon. Gentleman thinks for one moment that they will forget what his Government have done over the past 17 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is unduly cynical. She well knows the position regarding Kincardine bridge.

I wonder whether you could use your good offices to allow us to reconsider how the Committee handles statements. The first statement took three quarters of an hour and that left only 20 minutes for questions, which is unacceptable considering their importance. If we hare to have a fixed time limit for questions, should we not have a fixed time limit for statements? If not, surely the time limit should be much more flexible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the House authorities will take that into account when they consider the way in which these proceedings are organised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. In answer to a question on the Floor of the House, the Secretary of State stressed to me that local authorities in Scotland—and especially Glasgow—had not provided the figures regarding staffing for social work. After further investigation, I discovered that Mary Hartnoll's office for social work in Glasgow had supplied the Scottish Office with the relevant details. The Secretary of State was wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was not a point of order; the hon. Gentleman was making a political statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. On the time allowed for statements, Mr. Maxton, do you realise, that if we include the Secretary of State's answers, he spoke for well over half the time allowed? That is very good for the Secretary of State, but the rest of us find it rather tiresome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Do we interpret your answer to mean that you, as Chairman, will raise the issue with Madam Speaker and with the Chairman's Panel?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my Clerk points out, we are working under the order that was laid before and passed by the House last week. It is up to the House of Commons to take decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton. These matters were discussed through the usual channels. My understanding was that the Opposition wished to have less time for the statement and wanted to concentrate on a debate on Wednesday. That is what was agreed. It is rather extraordinary to hear hon. Members repudiating that arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we can now come to the main debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton. I wish to put the matter in context. There was an agreement on the time limits to be allowed here and in the important debate initiated by the Opposition that has still to be held. The time limits of three quarters of an hour and half an hours, as will be the case on Wednesday, for debating public expenditure are adequate enough. However, hon. Members have a right to expect that, when the Secretary of State makes statements, he will take into account the limited time that is available for cross-examination afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton. The Secretary of State suggested that the usual channels had agreed the time limits.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None of these points of order—or anything that happens in the usual channels—has anything to do with the Chairman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to tell the truth about the local government settlement. The Conservative party, which secured its fourth term of office by telling lies about tax and public finances, is seeking to deceive the Scottish people about the local government settlement in the Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would be better if the hon. Gentleman did not use the word "lies".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a rotten settlement, and the Government know it. It is based on 17 years of low growth, boom-bust instability and economic failure. However, the Conservative party seeks to play politics with the settlement in the desperate hope that local Labour councils will be blamed for the council tax rises and service cuts that must follow it as night follows day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are placing their trust on the inherent complexities of local government finance and on the creative accounting or new genre fiction that they will present soon. We trust the facts and the good sense of the Scottish people, who will see through the smokescreen of Government propaganda and throw out those few hon. Members on the Conservative Benches at the earliest possible opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first fact that can be seen from the statement is the cash cut of £34 million in Government support for local authorities this year. If we add in the non-block aggregate external finance, that cut becomes £26 million. As that is the figure that the Government are using, I will use it to be scrupulously fair to them. The second fact is that, last year, £45 million of special grants were given. They comprise the £38 million given at Kilmarnock following the magnificent campaign conducted last year and the £7 million special community care grant—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is it in order for the hon. Member speaking not to address the Chair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not in order, but I thought that the hon. Gentleman was directing his remarks to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hogg. Of course, I am addressing you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special grants of £45 million last year have been reduced to £18 million, which is a cash cut of about £27 million. We must take that fact into account when we consider Government support for local authorities. Therefore, in total, the cash cut is £53 million this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not want to admit that, so they do two things. First, they forget all about the special grants and pretend that they do not exist. That brings the cash cut down to £26 million. They then subtract £86 million of what they regard as old burdens that are disappearing. That methodology is legitimate, but only on two conditions. First, the old burdens must be genuinely old
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
and be disappearing. Secondly, and even more fundamentally, if old burdens are subtracted from the cut, new burdens must be added to it. Otherwise, the whole procedure is totally illogical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the Government's work of fiction. They start by saying that £60 million worth of savings will be made from local government reorganisation next year. That is the difference between what has been spent this year and what will be spent next. In fact, the Government say that there will be savings next year. However, nobody agrees with the Government except the Government. A recent detailed study by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities pointed out that the costs of local government reorganisation would be four times the Government's estimate and that, next year, they will be only £10 million less than this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are withholding £60 million for local government reorganisation costs next year, and £50 million of that will have to be paid for by council taxpayers. Every council taxpayer in Scotland will have to bear an average 5 per cent. increase in council tax just to pay for the costs of local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next thing that the Government do is subtract £26 million because nursery education will not be paid for by local authorities next year. That is the third fact: I concede that it is a fact. It is a Government fact—even they must sometimes tell the truth, but it is true only in a limited sense because when Labour is returned to power, we will scrap the nursery voucher scheme and given the money back to local authorities. In the meantime, it is true that £26 million will be saved. But to balance that, there will be £98 million of new burdens on local councils next year—that is even accepted by the Scottish Office. There will be extra community care responsibilities, extra police, a landfill tax and various other items. If we take away those old burdens and add on the new burden we have a £53 million cut balanced by £36 million of savings from the disappearing old burden and £98 million of new burden. If all that is added up we have a cut next year of £115 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that, after a similar announcement last year, his predecessor pledged that the Labour party would restore the cuts of £350 million if it was every to achieve power. Despite the hon. Gentleman's hand wringing, is he now saying that if the Labour party gained power it would immediately uprate contributions to local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing the Conservative Scottish Office budget for 1997 although I know that we would rather be discussing the Labour Scottish Office budget for 1998. We will obviously have to deal with a great crisis when we get into office. We will inevitably do so gradually: because of the mess that has been generated by the present Government, there is no magic solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having established the cut, let us move on to the Council tax. The fourth fact is that a reduction in Government grant gives rise to a correspondingly greater increase in the council tax. A cut in Government grant of about 1 per cent. will lead to a 5 or 6 per cent. increase in the council tax. The second chapter of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Government's novel tells us that the council tax is nothing to do with them and that it is up to local councils to decide how much money to put on council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the case. Whatever money is held back in Government grant must be extracted from local people. When the council tax bill with which the Conservatives hope to reap some great electoral dividend falls through people's letter boxes, people in Scotland will know that it is the 23rd Tory tax rise since the last general election. What they give with one hand in income tax cuts, they take away with the other in council tax increases. It is not just council tax increases: there was an overall increase in taxation in the so-called tax-cutting Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third chapter of the Government's novel tells us that services are also a matter for local councils; if services are cut, it is the local councils' fault. But two factors determine the level of services. The primary factor is the overall amount that councils are allowed to spend on services, which is determined to the last penny by the Government. The second factor is whether any individual council can impose a council tax in order to meet the cap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much money will the Minister allow local councils to spend on services next year? The figure for this year is £5,616 million and we want to know precisely how much he will allow them to spend next year. He has indicated an increase of 0.5 per cent., but I hope that he will allow certain new items beyond the capping limit. We need to know the figure so that we have some idea of service levels for next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, local authority expenditure per head in Scotland is 30 per cent. higher than England. Does he think that figure is too high or too low?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many reasons for that figure and studies are being carried out by the Government and by COSLA. One factor is the debt charges in Scotland. Another more significant factor is the level of deprivation and poverty. Many factors must be taken into account before facile statements like that are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an extra problem with services this year—that of mismatch. Some councils will be allowed to make only a small increase in council tax to cope with their large cut in services. Other councils will introduce a large increase in council tax and still have a large cut in services because of the problem of mismatch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow is the best-known council with that problem: there is talk of making cuts of £78 million in order to fall below the cap, but still having a council tax increase of 30 per cent. Clearly it is a particular problem for Glasgow, but it is also a problem for other councils that have lost out in the mismatch. That might be bearable if councils were having cuts for the first time next year. But this year £410 million has been taken out of councils in Scotland and 10,000 jobs have gone. Since the Conservatives ultimately control the service level we must ask them how many more jobs they will snatch from local government. How high will they force up charges for essential services? How many more old people's homes and other facilities will they demand be closed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just local authority services for which local authorities are now being blamed; they are now being blamed for bed blocking. They are beginning to be blamed for the crisis in the health service as well as the crisis in
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
local government. At a recent meeting between the NHS management executive and chairs of trusts and chief executives of trusts, the health officials were told to blame local authorities if there was blocking of acute beds in hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities do not have the money to provide more nursing home and residential care places, yet the Government are beginning to blame local authorities for a problem that is not their fault.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, just as the Labour party is abandoning its attempt to abolish competitive tendering in local government, local authorities will have to take on board the fact that it costs £200 per week more to look after old people in local authority homes on Tayside than in private sector homes, and they both provide an equal service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Party and Labour councillors accept a mixed economy of care, but the reality in Dundee and Tayside is, first, that people want to go to council homes. Secondly, the principal reason for the difference in charging is the low wage rate in private homes. That may appear to be a saving, but account must be taken of the family credit bills and other money that has to be paid to people who work in those low-wage nursing homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the subject of bed blocking—in his statement, the Secretary of State wanted to appear to be putting the health service before local authorities. I do not accept all his claims about the health service. We can doubtless deal with that on Wednesday. I would be out of order if I dealt with it today. There cannot be a separation between the health service and local authorities because local authorities are crucially involved in the delivery of health care through community care. Apart from the general local authority budget cuts today, we have also had the appalling cut to the housing budget which affects local government services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that the Secretary of State said specifically that he was adding an extra £15 million to health boards in order to prepare for any particular pressures this winter. The hon. Gentleman should take that properly into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister invites me to discuss health. He made an announcement at the Conservative party conference that there would be a £30 million increase in capital expenditure in the NHS. On investigation, we found that the money was taken from next year's budget. Where is the £15 million coming from? Of course, there is a crisis this winter; of course there is an election coming up and the Government do not want bad news in the health service now. But there is no use just looking at the figures for this winter; we must look at the figures over the past few years, at the projected figures and, in particular, at the waste that the Government have created through the internal market. Their claims about cutting health administration come a bit late in the day. Like arsonists, they are trying to damp down the fire that they created through their internal market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Housing is crucially involved with health, as we are now on that subject. The Minister and the Secretary of State cannot put health in a box and say, "Local government has nothing to do with health; housing has nothing to do with health." The reality is that people who live in cold, damp houses are far more likely to end up ill. The cuts in the housing budget today have been staggering and unbelievable—the local authority housing budget has been cut by one third. That means that my constituents who are waiting to get central heating systems or new windows will have to wait longer and longer. The Minister responsible for housing will no doubt say, "Oh well, all these councils should transfer their stock." He does not want anyone to live in council houses—he wants them all transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Edinburgh, steps are being taken to get additional investment by transferring a limited amount of stock from one estate to set up a local housing company, which the Government officially support, although their idea of local housing companies is slightly different from ours. But in Edinburgh, that local housing company cannot be set up unless there is an element of public subsidy. I have been told by the chair of housing in Edinburgh that the local housing company is under threat because of the vicious and draconian cuts to council housing budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, Scottish Homes has suffered too. Although it gets some of the money back, it will still lose out and the number of new builds and new starts in housing via housing associations will be way down next year from what it is this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I want to ask him a similar question to that asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). Is he aware that we will spend 26 per cent. more per council house in Scotland than in England? Does he think that that figure is too high or too low?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should get out and go round the council estates in his own and other people's constituencies and look at the state of the housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all know about the state of housing because there is a survey on the issue, in which the Scottish Office is involved. A quarter of Scottish houses are affected by damp, condensation or mould. We know all the other figures about the state of housing in Scotland as well. There is a desperate need, first, to improve the quality of Scottish houses and, secondly, to provide more houses. We all know about the homelessness problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am answering the question. It is obvious that there is not enough housing investment in Scotland, when we consider the quality of the stock and the problem of homelessness—more than 40,000 families are on council house waiting lists and an estimated 1,000 people sleep on the streets each night. It is all very well
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
the Secretary of State coming along like Father Christmas and saying, "Here's some money for the rough sleepers initiative," but it is about time too. He has been sitting on the research for months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Is he aware that Shelter has just worked out that for every £1 the Government have promised in their rough sleeper initiative, they are taking £35 away from every homeless person and from other people who live in appalling housing conditions throughout Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that point—it is absolutely true. At last, we have a rough sleepers initiative. It has existed in various English cities for a long time, although the need in Glasgow and other places has been shown to be greater than that in England. Okay, better late than never, but it is not enough. The Government created the problem and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) says, the money has come from somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My time is soon up, because I have to stick to 20 minutes, but I want to say in passing that outwith the local government settlement that has been announced in the last couple of weeks, there is the whole issue of urban regeneration. That is money that also goes to local authorities for particular areas of deprivation and that budget has also been cut from £86 million to £73 million in a three-year period. That will have a damaging effect on the most deprived areas of our cities as well. I think that there will be an Adjournment debate on that topic either today or on Wednesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, this will be the Government's last public expenditure statement. I am sure that we are glad about that. As the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) said, it will not be easy to sort out the crisis in local government, which is the result of fundamental economic failure. Redressing that balance will be a gradual process, but we shall begin to do it in government. Before very long, we shall begin to do it through the Scottish Parliament. That will bring to an end the type of decisions that have been announced today—decisions made by one man because of his arbitrary whim about what should get money and what should not. All decisions will be transparent and will be openly debated. In that way, issues such as housing and local government will move up the political agenda—they will be debated and decided on in a democratic manner by a democratic Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm), I am glad to have an opportunity to put the record straight and to reiterate the Government's approach to Scottish local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We very much value local government. We have devolved significant new powers to it and we want to work with it in a constructive partnership, but the interests of council tax payers and their families must come first and foremost. The Opposition have different priorities. Opposition Members refuse to face up to the financial and managerial realities that confront Scottish local

	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
government—rather, they utter meaningless generalities about what they would do if they had the opportunity. Their objective is to create more tiers of government, to take decisions further from people, add to bureaucracy and hike up taxation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I seek your guidance.

We are committed to devolving power downwards through local authorities, school boards, housing associations and companies, community councils, families and individuals. If local authorities want to play a constructive part in the new civic culture, they must learn to see themselves not as universal providers but as having an enabling role. Only by making that transformation can they remain relevant in a fats-changing society whose citizens increasingly expect to exercise choice through personal decision-making in every area of their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government accept that role. We are, for example, withdrawing from most day-to-day decisions affecting local authority capital spending. We shall distribute available resources through a formula rather than through consideration of councils' individual bids. At the same time, we shall allow innovation and creativity to be rewarded through challenge funding. Similarly, we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
planning to remove, or we have already removed, many minor and detailed controls. In return, we expect councils to devolve and decentralise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does local government expect from the Opposition? Money, obviously, and local government officials are not too fussy about where it comes from. I shall give Labour councillors credit by assuming that not all of them subscribe to the so-called McAllion doctrine—that thou shalt plunder the health service to keep local government happy. There is a new doctrine—the McAllion doctrine mark two—which the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) expounded to me in a recent discussion on television about Labour's spending plans. Of course, it was not much of a discussion—Opposition Members are notoriously coy about their spending plans. It emerged that the hon. Gentleman now believes that he could get £100 million for his friends in local government by shelving the measures in the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill, which he dislikes because it is horrid to criminals and would keep them in prison. The hon. Gentleman believes that they should be let out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we combine that with the hon. Gentleman's earlier scheme for pillaging the health service, we have his ideal civic society; while councillors tuck into free lunches, the streets outside are crowded with unhospitalised patients struggling towards their general practitioner's surgeries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does local government expect from the Labour party? Saturday's edition of 	<i>The Courier and Advertiser</i> in Dundee contained an article by Andy Nichol, the Scottish political editor, who stated that the party's Scottish spokesman on local government, the hon. Member for Leith, had made it crystal clear to a weekend conference of councillors that the coming election campaign would contain no detail and no commitments from Labour. The hon. Gentleman told the Conference that it could question the strategy, but that was the strategy. He said that there could be tactical difficulties if a spending commitment was turned into a tax bill and that that could mean losing the general election. That summarises the position in a nutshell. The hon. Member for Dundee, East is the former Labour party spokesman on local government, but the hon. Member for Leith is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
the current Labour spokesman; he will not promise anything and he will not tell local government what the Labour party intends to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair, Labour has spelt out clearly its intentions—a tax-raising Scottish Parliament. That would be the end of local government in Scotland except for a token ceremonial presence with no more powers than the surviving trade guilds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have often highlighted the disastrous bickering there would between Parliaments in Edinburgh and Westminster. Labour's tax-raising Parliament would try not just to wrest power from Westminster, but to grab all the responsibilities currently and increasingly vested in Scottish local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already got the Labour party's programme on devolution totally wrong. How can people trust statements from the Government telling us that we are wrong about trying to give folk an opportunity to have devolution when the Secretary of State for Scotland cannot even get information from his officials? They told him clearly that Glasgow social work staff did know how many people are employed as social workers. If the Minister cannot get that right, what chance has he got of telling the people of Scotland that the Labour party is wrong? We shall have a devolved Parliament in Scotland to stop the rogues and rascals in the Tory party running Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. gentleman must check his facts. The joint staffing watch survey that was carried out jointly between the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Office had great difficulty in publishing the information because certain authorities—in particular, Glasgow—had difficulty in telling us how many people they employed. COSLA will confirm that the social work numbers in Glasgow were in great doubt. The joint staffing watch survey, which was to have been published in July, could not be published until November because of the difficulty experienced with local authorities in getting figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has not answered the question that I should perhaps put to him—will he guarantee that his tax-raising Parliament would not take power from local government? My argument is that it would grab all the responsibility currently and increasingly vested in Scottish local government—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Those remarks are not terribly helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think, perhaps, that because I am making a sensitive point, the hon. Gentleman is growing restless. Any Labour councillor who believes that Parliament on Calton hill would not insist on taking over responsibility for Scottish education, for example, probably believes in Santa Claus too. However, that is not the only respect in which COSLA shows signs of confusion. When its annual poker game for local
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
government funding began, it demanded an extra £480 million—a triumph of aspiration over reality, but everyone loves a trier. The demand quickly dwindled to a more modest £180 million. The Government have allocated an increase of £132 million or 2.2 per cent. However, last week, COSLA's temperature soared again as it claimed a shortfall of £350 million and threatened council tax increases as high as 33 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister carefully avoids talking about the Government's spending policy, but does he admit that the Scottish budget will fall in cash terms in the next three years? No extra cash is available. Instead, filtering between different spending categories, on Government recommendations, will take place. How much money is being made available for pay and prices in next year's local authority budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows the Government's policy only too well; it is that pay increases should be funded through efficiency improvements. The hon. Gentleman's party has a much larger question to answer because it would, by going the independent route, face a significant deficit in Scotland. That deficit would be something in the order of £8 billion. That figure has been confirmed by the Fraser of Allander Institute. The hon. Gentleman should be careful about the claims that he makes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the heart of the debate. The Minister keeps referring to £132 million extra for Government-supported expenditure and £60 million extra for aggregate external finance. Those figures are obtained only by subtracting the £86 million of old burdens. How can that calculation logically be justified without the adding on of the £98 million of new burdens that will exist next year? Does the Minister accept that the £60 million savings from local government reorganisation are totally imaginery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not, during his entire speech, discuss what Labour would do.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating the Scottish Office budget for 1997. The Ministry has an obligation to explain how he can use phoney, fiddled figures and tell the people of Scotland that he is increasing grant and Government-supported expenditure when everyone knows that they are being cut. His logic is flawed. We will deal with the mess; it will not be easy. We have had 17 years of economic failure.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
I am not surprised at the claims of £350 million being short in local government finance, which I take with a pinch of salt. I remember Councillor Geddes of COSLA predicting that his Edinburgh administration would be £8 million in the red at the end of the year. That forecast turned, a few weeks later, into a reality of an £800,000 surplus. That hectic fluctuation in Councillor Geddes's arithmetic lends a stimulating unpredictability to COSLA's utterances. However, at least Councillor Geddes may know how many social workers he employs, unlike his colleagues in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal robustly with the suggestion that the Government can demonstrate a belief in a genuine partnership with local government only by allowing yearly increases in spending. Scottish local government is already the most generously funded in Great Britain. Spending levels are 30 per cent. higher than in England and 22 per cent. higher than in Wales. The wild claims that are made that restricting the growth of local government spending and expecting local government to finance pay rises by increased efficiency are approaches that cut deeply into essential services are nonsense. Local government already enjoys exceptionally generous funding. We must remember that there is an unusually difficult expenditure background to this year's settlement. That is further evidence of the extent to which the Government are prepared to put their money where their mouth is in supporting local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not accept that the money that we are dealing with is not Government money, but taxpayers' money. We all have an obligation to ensure that that is spent wisely. For the second successive year, we have improved on the previous year's plans. The level of Government support of expenditure, which is our view of what local authorities need to spend on loan and leasing charges and on providing services, has increased by 2.2 per cent., nearly £132 million. If local authorities would come to terms with the fact that our public expenditure policy is here to stay, and applies to them just as much as it does to the rest of the public sector, they too might appreciate that the Government are indeed generous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is it in order for the Government to use figures that I have proved conclusively to be fiddled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows the answer to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That simply shows that the hon. Gentleman is not fit to deliberate on local government finance matters. I am sorry, Mr. Hogg—the hon. Gentleman, not I, made the comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of aggregate external finance has increased by 1.1 per cent. or £60 million. That is £45 million more than local authorities expected from examining last year's plans for this year. That has happened against a background of spending levels for Scottish local authorities that will, in the coming year, be 30 per cent., higher per head of population than those of England. The grant that we provide to support that level of expenditure will be no less than 42 per cent. higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish local authorities have financial problems, but they are self inflicted. Debts are at such high levels—4.6 times higher than in England—that £793 million has
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
to be to be sliced from the settlement to service them. That sum of nearly £800 million might otherwise be available to spend on crucial, front-line services. The Government give high priority to vital services. We have increased the fire service grant-aided expenditure assessment by more than 11 per cent. and that for the police service by almost 10 per cent. We have also provided additional resources for education and social work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was claimed in the statement that £1 million had been made available to improve facilities at the Scottish fire service's training school. I went to see Colin Cranston, Lothian's fire master, and I realise what problems the fire service has. What is the relationship between the grant with respect to the Scottish fire service's training and the money that some of the fire masters want to be paid to the very impressive United Kingdom establishment at Moreton-in-Marsh? What is the settlement as between those two institutions? That is a matter of great concern to Lothian fire service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As that is a specific question, I will write to the honourable Gentleman with details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have honoured the commitment that we made last year to continue the supplementary mis-match scheme and the district equalisation scheme. I hope that the authorities concerned have used the breathing space that they have been offered to cut their spending and avoid over-burdening their taxpayers. Last week, I wrote to Councillor Bob Gould, the leader of Glasgow city council, to ask him whether he had stuck to his side of the arrangement by which he was to use this year as extra breathing space for bringing funding into line with the formula. The interests of council tax payers and their families are paramount. It is to safeguard local taxpayers' interests that we have retained capping; it is essential protection. The Labour party wants to remove capping on council tax, to impose the tartan tax and to level a crippling trade tax by returning business rates to local government. It will be a case of new Labour, new taxes. It is outrageous of COSLA to engage in sabre rattling about a 33 per cent. increase in council tax. The response of any local electorate to such a threat should be to reason that an administration that cannot conduct its affairs without such a grotesque increase should be voted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unreasonable burdens on council taxpayers fall only on people who pay their dues. As I said earlier, we have a scandalous total of £721 million of uncollected local government revenue. That is more than Councillor Geddes and COSLA asked for in their most ambitious moments. The money is there. It has already been allocated to local authorities. They simply refuse to collect it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that the bulk of the problem was caused by the poll tax, which was notoriously difficult to collect and which cost taxpayers 4p on income tax, according to Lord Lawson? Does he accept that sheriff officers are now responsible for collecting the tax and that, even if it was collected, it would make no difference to service levels? Perhaps he could also explain why £3,778 million of income and other taxes are uncollected by central Government, according to a parliamentary question of 26 April.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman believes that the uncollected local government revenue would make no difference to council tax payers, but it would reduce the council tax. The problem goes back to 1989. Therefore, local authorities have had plenty of time to collect the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider the council tax, £278 million remains outstanding. The community charge has been dead and buried for several years. If local authorities are committed to their paying council tax payers, they should have been able to collect the outstanding sum. At present, those who do not pay are enjoying services at the expense of others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To follow up the point that the honourable Minister for Leith made, senior Liberal Democrat councillors in Glasgow and Edinburgh told me that poll tax arrears were in the hands of sheriff officers. Therefore, what more could local authorities legally do? Sheriff officers are legally responsible for the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the arrears date from 1989; they are currently in the hands of sheriff officers. If that had happened sooner, local authorities would now have the tax revenue. In Glasgow £62 million of council tax is uncollected. Local authorities must deal with the problem and ensure that they collect their taxes. However, the Labour party has created an environment in Scotland in which some people regarded the council tax as a voluntary donation, which they need pay only if they feel like it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend referred to uncollected rents in Glasgow. Is not it the case that in Glasgow, as in south Ayrshire, 80 per cent. of local authority rents are funded by housing benefit? If that is the case, why are so many rents uncollected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend mentioned a point to which I had not referred. I am sure that he is right and that he will speak about it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government faces key challenges. They include providing better value for money to taxpayers and service users, demonstrating the highest standards of probity and conduct; discharging responsibility openly and being properly accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider value for money. Substantial improvements in services and reductions in cost have resulted from compulsory competitive tendering. The scope for greater benefit is apparent. Too many authorities have attempted to close off opportunities to competitive private sector providers and maintain in-house provision for its own sake. I hope that those days are behind us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compulsory competitive tendering for building and work services will be reintroduced in July next year—earlier for some small contracts. That is an excellent opportunity for local authorities to improve value for money. They do not have to wait that long. They could reintroduce CCT voluntarily before July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to read in 	<i>The Courier and Advertiser</i> that according to the honourable Member for Leith, the Labour party has shelved its plans to abolish CCT for council contracts. The honourable Gentleman may shake his head. The Labour party does yet another U-turn. On Friday, it was going to shelve its policy to abolish CCT, but today, it wants to abolish it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
It is vital that local government meets the highest standards of probity and is seen to act only in the public interest. Anxiety about that led the Government to establish a task force on local government conduct. I am glad that it has made substantial progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that councils are accountable to their electorate. The new, single-tier system of local government facilitates that. The scope for confusion and buck passing between two tiers of local government no longer exists. Voters can hold councillors accountable only if they have reliable information about their councils' performance. Some notable progress has been made, including the publication of comparative performance indicators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to extend that, so that even more information is in the public domain. If councillors do not know what is going on, it is difficult to understand how they can make predictions, especially the reckless predictions that the Opposition make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a long way to go. I am worried that new councils do not have sufficient management and financial information to give councillors a proper knowledge of services and expenditure. We should do something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public pay special attention to the allowances that councillors pay themselves. The Government set basic minimum rates, but, as a constituency Members of Parliament and as a Minister, I often hear expressions of anxiety about the growth in councillors' allowances. In Clackmannanshire, Scotland's smallest local authority, people wonder why some councillors earn as much as £20,000 in special responsibility allowances, which are normally awarded to committee chairmen, when there are no committees in that council. Councils must show accountability. I anticipate with interest the results of our study on comparative local authority spending north and south of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He complains that the economy is out of control, but he does not vote against our tax cuts. The Opposition are at sixes and sevens and do not know what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government faces many challenges, but has many opportunities, which the Government created, especially through reorganisation. We have simplified and cut the overhead cost of the unwieldy two-tier system. Where possible, we have removed unnecessary central Government control. We shall make further progress in future. Despite our critics' claims, we have provided steadily increasing resources for local government, even at a time of great pressure on public spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, we respect the rights and interests of electors and council tax payers. We shall continue to protect them through capping, unlike the Opposition,

As one who has been immersed in a previous E. coli incident, I can say that it is agony for everyone. I am reluctant to scatter blame through the agony of E. coli to understand how awful it can be—for all concerned. I should hope that the Hastons and the council will be consulted.

Before that, I am sure that he will put his mind to the problem of winter maintenance and the burden that will fall, in particular, on West Lothian—following the breaking up of Lothian regional council—because of the high ground around Whitburn and Fauldhouse. There are several reasons for allowing councils in the same position as West Lothian to have not favourable, but more equitable, treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there are real problems over care in the community for some of the successor authorities to Lothian and Strathclyde regions. I hope that the Government will consider those problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall address the Chair, not the audience, whom we do not admit exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Leith, but I put some of his comments down to his lack of Front-Bench experience. He was not, in my judgment, addressing the Chair properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one questions the facts. The fact is that council debt in Scotland is much higher per head of population. No one doubts that. It is not questioned. The cost of servicing the debt in Scotland is about four and a half times higher than in England. Obviously, that is a structural deficiency. Why do we have that debt problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one disputes that we spend more public money per head of population in Scotland, as measured by the combination of central Government funding and locally raised council tax revenue. As we spend more money and have a larger debt, something is obviously structurally wrong with how councils have been run. If one considers the housing situation carefully, one must realise—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman leave me alone? He has had ample opportunity to make his points. I want to address structural problems. If he intervened less and listened more, the hon. Gentleman might learn something.

Since the second world war, public funds have been spent on a massive scale throughout Scotland. Thousands of millions of pounds have been spent on building and renovating houses and bringing city centres up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. JOHN MAXTON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Glasgow, a new estate was built, was never lived in and was knocked down. Obviously, that was a colossal mistake. In other instances, unsuitable types of housing were built or repairs and renovations were not regularly carried out to maintain the stock's value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councils claimed that they could not do those things because they lacked funds. I return to my main point; we spend more per head and have a bigger debt. What prevented the councils from having the necessary housing funds? One must consider their rent policies. The councils should have set rents that would provide adequate funds for repair, maintenance and renewal. The sensible way to tackle any investment is to look after existing investment and service it properly. But that would have meant far higher rents than were set by the majority—if not all—of Scottish councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How did that affect the councils? If they had had realistic rents, they could have serviced debt and maintained stock as well as getting back increases in housing benefit. That benefit is paid to the individual, through the council's housing coffers. Scotland's councils have deprived themselves of hundreds of millions—possibly thousands of millions—of pounds that could have gone into the coffers to deal with the debt problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is shaking his head. He cannot dispute that large sectors of the private sector obtained housing benefit and have been able to renew stock. He cannot deny that vast grants—taxpayers' money; public money—have been paid. There is ample evidence in the city of Dundee of tenements that have been restored, brought back to life and made fit to live in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every time the hon. Gentleman opens his mouth, he shows his ignorance about Scottish housing. Does not he realise that 60 to 70 per cent. of local authority tenants in most areas rely on housing benefit to pay the very high rents that councils have been forced to levy because of Government rules? Its costs the Government in excess of £900 million a year in housing benefit when that money could be invested in housing stock and tackling homelessness. The hon. Gentleman should address his remarks to those issues, rather than making bogus arguments that make no sense anywhere in the real world, although they might make some sense in the rarefied atmosphere of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that I gave way to the hon. Gentleman, as it shows clearly that one set of mathematic rules apply effectively in one area but not in another. The sad truth is that councils in Scotland have themselves to blame for their level of debt. Such debts would have been substantially lower-probably non-existent—if councils had had realistic levels of rent. There is no point in members of the Committee shaking their heads. I know
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
first that when realistic rents have been properly levied, the situation is less acute than in areas where councils have massive housing debts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks about the level of debt. Can he explain logically something that the Minister did not explain? Why should there be one rule for all councils if the purpose is to bring down debts to an acceptable level? Why should my council—Falkirk—with a debt of just over £4,000 per household have to spend 75 per cent. of its money from the sale of council houses to reduce its debt when it is already well below the Scottish average? It is important to realise that council tenants pay all the charges on to debt and all the income charges on housing. Councils should be allowed to decide what level of debt they want and the level of charges to put on rents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is an economist and well knows that one cannot buck the market over a long period. That is never more true than in borrowing and using borrowed money. I am willing to concede that a certain council may have been prudent in handling its council house rents and there may be a case for considering it separately. However, the principle that I am talking about is substantially valid across Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East and it may be worth considering. I do not want him or anyone else to think that I am blinkered. I am addressing the acute and massive problem of debts, which councils have created for themselves. Councils providing similar services south of the border do not have those debts, so there must be a structural fault that should be examined. The charge must be laid fairly on the Labour Party because it has largely run councils in Scotland for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another structural matter, which I mentioned earlier when I referred to the inquiry in Tayside. It found that there was a difference of £200 a week between the private sector and local authorities for the same quality of service. The inquiry said that there was nothing to pick between the services; but a difference of £200 per individual per week means millions of pounds across Scotland. Local authorities should look carefully at being enablers, not providers of service. There is no doubt that the private sector can provide such services more effectively and efficiently. I say that not dogmatically, but practically. When one hears how council bodies are run compared with competitive tendering for services, one realises how better value can be obtained by tendering for such services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My message to the Committee and to the next Conservative Government is to address those structural problems. I have been trying to persuade my colleagues on the Front Bench that, just as we introduced legislation to address the structural problems in employment, we must look carefully at ways of allowing local authorities to become enablers rather than providers. They are not good providers; they are expensive and create massive debts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.55 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow the hon. Gentleman, because I disagree with just about everything he said. Our debate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
has, not unnaturally, focused on some of the financial implications of the earlier statement, which is right and proper in its way. However, I hope that we shall not lose sight of the fact that the debate is about local government as a whole—it is not about local government finance in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liberal Democrats want to examine local government in the round and from the more fundamental view of its future. The Committee should be asking, "What is local government for?" The hon. Member for North Tayside made a case, which came as no surprise, that local government should be about enabling. The council should have an annual meeting to award contracts and then it should go on holiday and come back in 12 months to award more contracts for the following year. That is an arguable option, but, in the Scottish context, that is not how local government should be organised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are different models that could be used to develop and promote local government in Scotland, but I think that it should be more about providing a local voice than anything else. If local people believe that services should be provided by their local authority, good for them. Let them elect people who will do that, and hold them to account. For the past 17 years, the Government have assumed in a rather arrogant way that they can control what local authorities do. They assume that they are better than local electors at determining what happens at the hands of local government. That balance is out of kilter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there has to be some sort of constructive interface with central Government because both central and local government are largely doing the same thing at different levels. However, we have had the bruising experience of reorganisation in the past 17 years, and there are still arguments about the residual cost of that reorganisation. It cost local authorities far more than was estimated by the Government either at the time or even now. There is a constant war of financial attrition between central and local government. I would argue that in the past 17 years, we have seen a massive and unacceptable level of centralisation. Local authority powers have been moved into the hands of central Government. Perhaps that is what the Conservative party wanted to achieve and what the hon. Member for North Tayside wants to intervene to defend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that the hon. Gentleman is not in any doubt about my position, I make it clear that I want local decisions to be made locally. I want the structures changed so that local authorities can be held accountable for those decisions. I do not want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for mistakes made because of the current structures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not have the confidence to allow the electorate to decide that? There is no possibility of doing that in the present electoral system. Since William Ewart Gladstone was a boy, we have been trying to advocate a much more sensitive system of proportional representation. Rotten boroughs, which become locked into party majorities for both parties over a period, are inimical to local electors' control of the local government process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that his party is advocating an extra tier of government, in which it is almost inevitable that power will be taken away from
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
the people and centralised, through a tax-raising Parliament? At least, his party is being more honest than the official Opposition about the fact that it will raise taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would, if necessary, raise taxes, especially to prioritise the important needs of the education service. In terms of establishing a Scottish Parliament, I agree that there would also be a role for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be diminished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. The role of local authorities would not be diminished; it would be augmented, because we would give them the powers of general competence. That is a mile away from what the hon. Member for North Tayside said when he talked about restricting the role of local authorities to that of enablers. In my opinion and that of my party, the powers of general competence would have to be protected by giving the electors more control—the way to do that would be to change the electoral system. Electors should be given much more control over how their local authorities are spending council tax revenues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was taken aback by the Minister's speech, when he began by saying how much he valued local government and how he had been generating a partnership with local authorities over the past 17 years. Let him tell that to COSLA and see what response he gets. It defeats the use of the English language to talk about a relationship being a partnership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman probably did not hear my croaking, but I completed the sentence by saying that the interests of the council tax payers and their families are paramount. Most of the disagreement between the Government and local government has arisen over funding and the fact that local authorities in Scotland are being funded 42 per cent. higher per head of population than in England and are spending 30 per cent. higher per head of population. Therefore, I look forward to local authorities having a meaningful dialogue about better value for money for the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right. I shall ask the Minister about resources. Why have the Government been loading legal responsibility on the shoulders of local authorities without giving them the resources to pay for it? For example, the Children Act 1989, the landfill tax, the recognition of carers and the assessment provision have placed on local authorities layer upon layer of new statutory duties and responsibilities. Have they received a brass farthing for those additional responsibilities? No. Is the Minister surprised that local authorities are squealing that they are not being given the necessary resources to carry out such important jobs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about efficiency saving? For the fourth consecutive year, local authorities have been asked to try to save enough money to pay for salary and inflationary increases. They can do it once; they might be able to do it twice; it is doubtful whether they can do it successfully thrice. But, after four years in a row, they are not cutting bureaucratic excesses, but cutting deeply into the level of services in the next financial year, resulting in professional redundancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ensure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that, had local authorities done what they should have done over those years and funded the services through efficiency improvement instead of taking the money from reserves, they would not be facing some of their present problems. Many who serve on the local authorities are the same councillors and executives who served on the old authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister said, but the authorities are not entirely masters of their own resources in other respects. Some health service budgets have suffered severe cuts, which have had an impact on social work departments and requirements in respect of community care. We, in the Borders, have suffered severe cuts in the Benefits Agency budget. Furthermore, the capital expenditure made available to housing associations for housing has been reduced, which has had a severe impact locally. Local authorities are fighting on several fronts. They cannot afford the service levels and the professional staff that they consider necessary. Central Government do not understand what is going on in some local authority areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a local point before I finish my remarks. I say squarely to the Minister that the way in which rural authorities must cope with the current capping regulations is unfair. The regulations reflect on the track record of those authorities that were the predecessors of the current unitary authorities. In south-east Scotland, our record of raising and spending money was prudent. It was right and proper. It was what local people wanted and the local authority was discharging its duty properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, against the background to the changes that have occurred since the creation of unitary authorities, that track record has been frozen into the system so that previously high-spending authorities have more capacity and flexibility in terms of the caps that are applied to them than rural authorities in south-east Scotland, for example, which have low budgets and track records of low expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again. Given that he is firmly in a Lib-Lab pact these days, does he agree with the Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), who recently visited Glasgow and said that the city had got a raw deal and that, in fact, money was being diverted away from it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes my point for me. There are vastly different circumstances between local authorities in the central, industrial belt and those elsewhere. He should not be asking me such questions; they should be addressed to those with responsibilities for such matters. The analysis of the hon. Member for Leith, who spoke for the official Opposition, was spot on. It would have been more convincing, however, if he had had the courage to vote against the tax cuts in the Budget and put forward a case for tackling the shortfalls in local authority expenditure. I shall leave the subject of capping with the Minister in the hope that he will consider it carefully, because rural authorities are being treated unfairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make a plea on behalf of a constituency bid that has been made for the capital challenge funding. I am a little nervous about top slicing capital funds, although
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
we have been lucky in that Kelso bridge is to receive the necessary finance under the roads budget. The Borders council has made an important bid for social and economic regeneration in Hawick, which is going through some difficulties. The textile industry in the town is in decline and several other factors are operating against it in respect of its economic position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health board is considering plans for a cottage hospital that could transform the central part of Hawick and would present a unique opportunity for the town. If we can put together the health fund project with the capital bid, it could regenerate the town centre. It is the biggest town in my constituency and it is under social and economic pressure. Will the Minister carefully consider the possibility of that bid finding favour?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the subject of the debate, local government is an essential part of our democratic process and it should be an effective local voice for the area that it serves. The Government's record has been to denigrate, diminish and divert powers away from local authorities. It would take a new Government after the forthcoming election to redress the balance and to restore the role of local government to its rightful place in our democratic system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.8 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, when I intervened, the Secretary of State said that he did not accept my figures. However, the appendix that he handed to me this morning shows that £236 million was spent on housing this year, but that next year the planned expenditure allocation is £210 million. If that is not a cut of 11 per cent., I should like to know what is. I noted this morning that Shelter has taken over all housing cuts in general, affecting both local authorities and Scottish Homes. The housing budget in Scotland will be cut, in total, by 28 per cent. When the Secretary of State was correcting me, perhaps he meant to say that the position was even worse than I had at first through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that members of the Committee will forgive me for concentrating on Glasgow this morning. Its position for the forthcoming year is dire. Its capital resources for housing revenue account will decrease from about £70 million this year to approximately £50 next year. The Secretary of State has said that he is cutting spending on local government to put more money into health and education. It seems remarkable that he does not realise that dry, damp-free homes contribute to good health and that forcing people to live in unhealthy homes means that more people need to use the health services, costing the NHS yet more money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Never a week goes by at my surgery without a mother telling me that she has one or more child with asthma or bronchitis and that one of her bedrooms is unusable because of severe dampness and cold. This cut will mean that window replacement programmes suffer even more in coming years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The outstanding debt that the council owes on the HRA is about £1.119 billion, but the housing stock now stands at 107,943 homes so the average debt per property is more than £10,000. Tenants carry the burden of that debt in their rents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
about the debt burden on tenants, does she agree that tackling the problem of escalating housing debt—about £4 billion throughout Scotland—must become a priority to protect the people who come to our surgeries week after week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has intervened at a useful point—I was about to deal with that matter. Surely, he would agree that the more properties that are transferred from council control and the more that are demolished, the more the debt burden falls on council tenants, and therefore, rents increase yet again. Council tenants have to bear the entire burden of that debt, yet central Government create the impetus for transferring properties. Lack of capital makes transfer attractive to tenants because, when their council homes are not improved or repaired, it is attractive to transfer to a housing association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should those who do not transfer take the burden of the capital debt of all the housing stock, which was built to provide public sector housing? I had assumed that the Government knew who would bear the burden when they created the policy, but I read in the 	<i>Daily Mail</i> of 6 December that Michael Hirst, the chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, believes that the council tax payer carries the can. Is it too much to hope that Government at least know whom they are making suffer for their local government policies? Michael Hirst expressed some sympathy with council tenants, but he was not so concerned about them as about council tax payers, even though tenants pay council tax as well as rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow faced a 19 per cent. increase in council tax in 1996–97. Because of swingeing cuts in grants, council tax payers will have to find an additional £23 million this year—equivalent to a £126, or 16 per cent., increase on each bill. One-off measures taken to restrict the increase in 1996–97 cannot be repeated, so the council faces a substantial rise in council tax levied, even without inflation or increased spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the public face a £78 million cut in services because of the Government's estimates of assumed savings under local government reorganisation and the introduction of the nursery voucher scheme. If that is not sleight of hand, the Government should be able to show the details on which their estimates are based to the council's elected members and finance officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to be brief because other hon. Members want to contribute to the debate, but people in Glasgow feel abandoned by the Government. They are saying that they are being punished financially and economically for their refusal to support the Government politically. If that is not so, what is the reason for such policies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.14 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must begin by telling the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that I am sympathetic to what he said about capping. I regret that the Government did not introduce capping when they introduced the community charge. Perhaps if they had done so, it would have been a different story. As local government has just been consolidated and its budgets established after major change, perhaps capping could be phased out, so that local authorities could take responsibility for their actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
On the comment about devolved power for local authorities made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, during the past 10 to 15 years the Government have been responsive to the idea of devolving power. It is ironic that the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) suggested that the Scottish Office should have overridden North Lanarkshire environmental health department. That demonstrates some of the confusion that there is within politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, I wear with pride the tie of Cunninghame district council. I served on that council for four years and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was obliged to step down, much to my regret as I had one of the largest majorities there, which I am sure I would have increased if work had allowed me to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that Cunninghame district council no longer exists. Instead, there is the North Ayrshire authority, along with those in south and east Ayrshire. Those authorities have come about because of the demise of Strathclyde regional council. I shall take up a point made by an old colleague who is a former chairman of the Scottish Labour party, a former convenor of planning at Cunninghame district council and, today, convenor of the Ayrshire structure plan committee—a joint committee set up between the three new authorities. He welcomed the fact that control now lies in Ayrshire—control has been taken away from Strathclyde, which failed to identify with the detailed needs of Ayrshire—and he got it absolutely right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The demise of Strathclyde and the change to single local authorities was absolutely correct. Opposition Members objected to it and fought hard in Committee, but they were wrong. Sam Gooding's words today demonstrate that we were right and the Opposition were wrong and I am delighted that he spoke out in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith spoke about community care. As far as I am concerned, he insulted private nursing homes by suggesting that they underpaid their staff and did not come up to the standards of public sector homes—he should know better than that. One of the problems of the management of local authority nursing homes is their bureaucratic structure. Opposition Members say that the management structure of health boards is bureaucratic, but a local authority residential home has a manager, an assistant manager, a financial manager and shift managers—a top-heavy organisation, which adds to costs. The private sector certainly could not afford that structure, which explains one of the differences in costings between the private and public sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are great concerns about community care. It is totally wrong to make the providers the paymasters, as is done in social work departments. There is an overlap in the use of cash in the community care sector and that is bad news. Social work departments take account of the amount of cash spent on each individual, but they do so within their own remit. They fail to address the fact that health boards and trusts also have added costs. So the financing of community care is totally out of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on Scottish Affairs is considering that matter, so there might be recognition of the fact that health care providers as well as social work providers must be involved to ensure that the public's needs continue to be met fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the weekend, I picked up a document on private finance initiatives, which commended the fact that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
Ferryfield house in Edinburgh has opened 60 beds to accommodate elderly patients and those suffering from dementia. The beds are provided through the national health service trust, but it would have been more appropriate for them to be in the community-care sector, under the responsibility of social work departments. Will my hon. Friend the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, in my area, there was full consultation on community care? The health board will provide some money, but there is still talk of the wholesale shutting of hospitals. People who should be cared for in hospital are being turned out; the health authority is desperately pushing to save money by throwing folk out and I shall give examples later. The system is supposed to be tripartite, but the consultation failed miserably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is the reverse. In south Ayrshire in my constituency, the health board is keeping in hospital people who want to go into private nursing homes, because there is no funding through the social work system. People are being kept in hospital beds and provided with health care at a cost of £1,000 a time. If they went into the private sector nursing homes of their choice, the cost to the state would be £303 per week overall. That is the mix-up that must be dealt with in the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not concentrate on community care, as other hon. Members want to speak, so I move on to housing—another key local authority issue. Opposition Members have failed to recognise the changes that have been made over the years. It is no longer the case that local authorities are the only public sector providers; now, Scottish Homes and housing associations also provide housing. The Government have tried to meet public aspirations in Scotland. Opinion polls tell us that 80 per cent. of Scottish people want to be private home owners. When the Government came into power, less than 40 per cent. of people in Scotland owned their own homes; 63 or 64 per cent. of people lived in houses supplied by public authorities. That situation has changed beyond recognition. Far less than 50 per cent. of people live in local authority homes and 58 per cent. of people own their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members fail to recognise the amount of money that have been injected into the housing system through that change. People have dug into their pockets to improve their homes—that has been a tremendous boost. Scottish Homes has involved the private sector; we are told that the level of capital expenditure is falling, but last year Scottish Homes received £250 million from the Government and £150 million from the private sector. That is all good stuff—it is going into the fabric of our land, and people can enjoy the benefits. I cannot understand why Opposition Members constantly carp and bicker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Reid 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent an area in Lanarkshire similar to Hamilton and I welcome the fact that there has been the vast change in direction described by the hon. Gentleman. Local councils still have enormous public housing problems to deal with, however.
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that, rather than having £555 per house, South Lanarkshire council has only £333 per house in allocated resources to spend, despite the fact that a hugh housing debt was inherited from Glasgow? The area now deals with council housing from four former district councils, with the same budget that one of them—Hamilton district—had? That is the reality facing South Lanarkshire council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister may reply to that, but, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, each local authority area is different. In the future, we should not expect one rule to suit the whole of Scotland; we should be more specific. To that extent, I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider investment in housing, the failed programmes in Scotland, and the fact that councils have been allowed to reinvest that cash. I pay tribute to the former Tory-led Kyle and Carrick district council, which, over the past four or five years, invested one heck of a lot of cash into improving its housing stock and did a very good job. It recognised, however, that to achieve that, it had to put rents up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That relates to another major change. The hon. Member for Dundee, East talked about housing benefit; he rightly said that £900 million of central Government money was spent on the housing stock. The Government have spent that amount of public money, not on bricks and mortar, but on funding the individuals who needed support, and I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman, like me, would applaud that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that, on Wednesday, the Committee will debate the public expenditure survey at Westminster, but I point out to Opposition Members that the aggregate external finance allocations are 42 per cent. higher per head in Scotland than in England. I am happy to give way to any Opposition Member who wants to intervene on that. The hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham) talked about devolution, but if Opposition Members get their way—Liberal Democrat Members want Labour Members to be bidie-ins on the issue—and there is devolution and a Scottish Parliament, they must realise that the voice of the Secretary of State for Scotland in Cabinet would be lost. What would happen to the AEF then? Would the Scottish differential be maintained? I guarantee that it would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On local authority spending and Cabinets, I remind the Committee of what my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) said about the visit of the right hon. Member for Sedgefield to Glasgow last week. The Leader of the Opposition said in last Thursday's 	<i>Glasgow Evening Times</i> that funding for Glasgow was not as high as it should be. He said that Glasgow was being treated unfairly in the division of local authority funding across Scotland. Last year, however, COSLA and the Scottish Office agreed to disaggregate finances. On that basis, South Ayrshire council lost out while Glasgow gained. When the right hon. Member for Sedgefield visited Ayr on Friday, I bet that he did not say much to local authority members who took him round the town; if he had, he would have had a flea in his ear. He gave then another story—another place, another day, another story. That is why the reputation of the right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
Member for Sedgefield among Scottish people is as low as was suggested in the findings of the Labour party's canvassing of the public, which were published last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enough of that—[HON. MEMBERS: "No. More, more."' No. You, Mr. Maxton, will take me to task, as other hon. members want to speak. I want to raise other matters. I am disappointed that the Government have decided to delay until July 1997 the insistence that local authorities adopt compulsory competitive tendering. There are small contractors in my constituency who have supplied excellent services to local authorities for years, but who are being taken off the list and are not being offered the work that they did before. That work is going to direct labour organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I have received significant representations from small contractors all round the country. As a result of one consultation exercise, we have reintroduced compulsory competitive tendering for contracts up to £25,000, with effect from 1 April, rather than 1 July next year. Like my hon. Friend and unlike the opposition, I am totally committed to passing on the benefits of CCT to the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that. The Conservative party will follow that line, although I am not sure that the Opposition will—should they ever get their hands on government. I therefore welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Leith has suggested in several media articles—I have not checked their authenticity—that CCT would be part of future Labour party thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be fitting to refer to North Lanarkshire council. It has just received £500,000 of lottery funds—another source of funding—for a golf leisure complex in Airdrie. That is great news. The council has used its initiative, done what a local authority should do and achieved something worth while. However, I want to make an appeal to North Lanarkshire council because I had great difficulty finding my way here today: for goodness sake, do something about your road signs—they are abysmal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to change my tone and register my sympathy and thanks to North Lanarkshire for the way in which it has dealt with recent tragedies. Its environmental health department has risen to the occasion and dealt with major events. I await with interest the findings of the fatal accident inquiries. I would hate to have been in the shoes of the individuals who had to deal with the recent huge problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Today's debate is, however, one of the most important that we could have
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
and its results will affect every man, woman and child in Scotland because they rely day in, day out on local authority services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An anti-Scottish Tory party is waging war on local authorities in Scotland. It feels free to do so because it controls none of them—the Scottish electorate had the sense to chase it from every authority in scotland. We are witnessing a total Tory defeat and an attempt to shuffle political blame onto local councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's settlement means that all Scottish councillors will face horrendous choices, but the public know who is to blame. Today's statement does not represent budgeting—it simply shuffles money between Scottish Office budget headings, constantly robbing Peter to pay Paul. Increases in any service can come only from cutbacks in other services, and vital daily local government services will take the biggest hit because of today's statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, 10,000 jobs were lost; next year, thousands more Scots will be thrown onto the dole queues. The settlement will result in poorer services and higher council taxes and rents. The Tories cannot provide a proper Scottish local government service. Indeed, under this anti-Scottish Tory party, we no longer have local government—we have only local administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Budget statement, the Secretary of State tried to pull the wool over the eyes of the Scottish people and suggested that overall expenditure would increase by 2.2 per cent., with a 1.1 per cent. increase in Government grant. That is dishonest and inaccurate. The reality is not an increase in funding, but a substantial cut. Neither of the supposed increases takes account of inflation. The presentation of the figures in cash terms is a deliberate and shameful attempt to mislead. The convention has always been to present the figures net of the effects of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The claim of £60 million in so-called savings due to the Government's reorganisation is unfounded and is nothing like the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy's estimate of £281 million in real costs. Independent analysts insist that any adjustment made to take local government reorganisation into account should not exceed £10 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So what is the justification for the Scottish Office's assumption of £60 million in savings? That is an important question, as the difference of £50 million in that sector alone accounts for about half of the apparent 2.2 per cent. increase and almost all of the claimed increase in Government grant. Increases in pay and prices mean that £130 million is needed to meet them, yet for the fourth year in a row Government grant and expenditure limits have failed to take into account wage increases, and all pay rises will again have to be self-financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cumulative strain on councils will mean inevitable pay freezes and job cuts, as the Minister admitted this morning. There will be extra strain on local authorities: local services will be hit, as will what local authorities can do on behalf of their populations. The COSLA-Scottish Office working party on local Government finance identified a requirement of £284 million to meet new burdens and pressures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
COSLA has identified what it calls inescapable costs of £180 million from the working party's list. That would represent an increase of only 3 per cent. and cover only essentials in key services. However, even that much-needed sum has not been met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central Government have implemented a string of public promises, such as care in the community and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, but they have failed to provide adequate additional funding for the new obligations that they have placed on local authorities. Legislation alone cannot meet people's needs. The Government must not be allowed to absolve themselves of responsibility after the legislative process has been completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Care in the community can in fact mean no care at all when a lack of resources denies some of our most vulnerable citizens the care and support that they need. Implementing the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will cost £15 million, but the Government appear not to have provided the additional expenditure that would enable local authorities to fulfil their obligations under the legislation. Local Government spending and borrowing are so tightly controlled by central Government that inevitably it falls to council tax payers to finance the extra costs—if central Government allow them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish National party is the only party to have fully costed policy commitments. Above and beyond the shortfall imposed by Tory cuts, we have ensured that the policy commitments in our programme for Government are backed with an additional £1.4 billion to enable local authorities to meet local need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State today has declared his intention financially to strangle local authorities. Let me tell Ministers that only independence will allow Scottish local authorities to be funded properly. A Scottish Assembly would face the same problem with pocket money that exists now because the London Exchequer has complete control over central Government. Only independence will allow all of Scotland's resources to be available for all Scotland's people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite protests from ground level, New Labour's leadership has made it clear that little will be done to restore the cuts if the Labour party wins the general election. In July, the Leader of the Opposition said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the future of local councils will not be based on spending an increased share of the national cake, but on improving efficiency and ensuring that every council sees its aim as matching the performance of the best".</p></blockquote>
No wonder the hon. Member for Hamilton looked so embarrassed last week when he refused to say whether the cuts, which have so devastated local government and local democracy, will be restored by New Labour. I repeat the question asked earlier: will Labour restore the budget and housing cuts? I agree with the comments from Labour Front-Bench Members that the cuts will be devastating. I seek a commitment that they would restore those cuts, but we have not heard one and it does not seem that we will hear one now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with so many of the Government's actions, inevitably it is the Scottish people who will be forced to pay the bill. We face a bitter mixture of job losses, service cuts and dramatic hikes in council tax. Council tax in England is set to rise between 6 and 7 per cent., but the
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has calculated that the average increase in Scotland will be about 13 per cent., or £92 for average band D tax. Council taxpayers in Scotland are having to foot the bill for the Tory tax bribe to buy votes in middle England. Income tax cuts for the well-off have gone hand in hand with council tax increases and service cuts for those in need. That has been the pattern in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing sector, without doubt, is suffering the worst cuts. There has been a deplorable lack of investment in Scotland's housing and we hear today that there will be cuts of about 30 per cent. in local authority housing and about 26 per cent. in Scottish Homes. We are now facing nothing short of a housing crisis. About 500 to 1,000 people sleep rough every night while too many people are compelled to live in housing that is cold, damp and overcrowded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of taking steps to deal with that deepening crisis, the Secretary of State has significantly exacerbated it by imposing the worst every housing settlement. Indeed, it is a Christmas kick in the teeth to those most in need. The £5 million a year for the rough sleepers initiative is simply a thinly disguised sugar coating for that bitter pill. It is a death-bed confession of 17 years of Tory failure to address this important problem, which is a disgrace and a black mark on our society. It is no surprise that there is a coming election that allows the Government to take this action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year's announcement cuts deep into the bone, leaving local authorities powerless to meet housing need. Seventy-five per cent. of capital receipts set aside for debt repayment represents £170 million that would otherwise be spent on housing investment, leaving little or no money for modernisation and new builds. That affects about 30,000 local authority households across Scotland. It can only add to the problems of decline in housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tories say that their policies are to create employment, lower taxes, reduce social security spending and help small businesses, but their anti-Scottish policies are producing exactly the opposite results. For example, the redemption rates on capital receipts will destroy local businesses, raise council taxes and council rents, create unemployment and raise social security spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Angus council is a financially prudent and sensible authority, which has the second lowest capital debt in Scotland and the second lowest rents in Scotland. However, because of this measure, it will lose about £3 million for its housing budget at a stroke of the Government's pen. That will prevent the building of 40 sheltered housing developments—Angus is one of the few councils that continue to build sheltered housing—and 170 house modernisations. It will delay window, door and heating replacements and other house updating, and cause a possible 17 per cent. rise in rents. That is all due to Government policy and is against the wishes of that prudent local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I point out to the Minister that all of Angus council's building and maintenance work is carried out by private contractors, so the effect of the cut on local businesses and employment will be catastrophic. The Government have succeeded in uniting against their policies all political parties, the trade unions and employers' organisations in Angus. Even the two surviving Tory Angus councillors have publicly come out against these anti-Scottish, Tory policies. When the local council sneezes, the local economy catches cold.

	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
The Secretary of State cited health as a priority in this year's expenditure, but there is abundant evidence that investing in housing generates substantial health savings. It would also produce energy savings and go some way towards eradicating fuel poverty which, as the coming months will testify, contributes to thousands of excess winter illnesses and deaths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in previous years, this year's housing and general local government settlements have underlined the need for a Scottish Parliament, not a Mickey Mouse Assembly which would have to go cap in hand to Westminster each year, as the Scottish Office does. A real Scottish Parliament which was accountable to the Scottish people and working in partnership with local authorities to make and implement policies would ensure that adequate resources were made available to meet real need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government has been chronically underfunded for years. There is precious little that those involved can do about it. Central Government, however, cannot wash their hands of responsibility and certainly cannot expect to get away with it. The Secretary of State has expressed his concern at the level of housing capital debt; indeed, more than half the rent paid by local authority tenants now goes on servicing that debt. But instead of imposing those staggering debt repayments, which punish the homeless and poorly housed for the Government's failure, a wiser move would be to transfer that debt to central Government. At current prices, that would free £945 million over four years to tackle housing problems and meet housing need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transferring housing capital debt would be a priority for an SNP Government and the first step to a comprehensive programme to invest in Scotland's housing. The SNP believes that a warm, secure and affordable house is a fundamental human right. That the Government can impose such drastic cuts when so many people in Scotland lack even the most basic shelter is a disgrace. The cuts are Tory in conception, Tory in execution and anti-Scottish in their attack on the living standards of the people of our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last April, 40,000 parents, teachers and pupils marched through the streets of Edinburgh to protest against education cuts. It was the Secretary of State to whom they directed their anger. The cuts in local government present grim prospects for the coming year—job losses, council tax rises and cuts in essential services are inevitable. If the Secretary of State intends to continue punishing the Scottish people for not voting Tory he should remember that they are well aware of who is to blame. The hour of the general election is at hand. The Government will not escape the judgment of the Scottish people and we all look forward to that day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise a few brief points. First, we have listened all morning to lectures from Conservative Members about the level of debt of local authorities. That is from a Government who have doubled the national debt over the past five years. It took about 300 years to reach the 1992 level of debt. It took those people in the Government five years to double it, but they have the nerve to lecture local authorities in Scotland about their levels of debt. No one can take the Government seriously. I am reminded of being lectured by the late Robert Maxwell about how to
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
run pension funds—that is what it has been like listening to those people telling us how local authorities should deal with their debts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we heard nonsense from the hon. Members for North Tayside and for Ayr—the hon. Members for Ayr has now sneaked out—about how the Government are committed to housing benefit and to funding the individual to ensure that people can afford local authority rents. Has the hon. Gentleman been sleeping for the past year? Does not he know about the statutory instruments which have been passed in the House of Commons denying under-25-year-olds the right to accommodation other than single-person accommodation? They are not allowed the use of their own kitchen or bathroom. That is not enough—the Government have extended that to all single people up to the age of 60. Then, they have the nerve to tell us that they are funding the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are depriving individuals of the most basic of human rights, which they have in every other country in western Europe but are not allowed here because the Government are obsessed with cutting public spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister—I believe that he attacked me in my absence, so I will attack him in his presence—has the nerve to say that he is concerned that money is being diverted from front-line services. What have we been dealing with all morning on the capital receipts rules? Capital receipts are money that councils got from the sale of assets. They could then spend it on front-line services. What did the Government do? They brought in a rule for the general fund which states that 25 per cent. this year has to be diverted from front-line services, 50 per cent. next year and 75 per cent. the year after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worse for housing—the figure is 25 per cent. this year and 75 per cent.—immediately—next year. Those people are diverting public expenditure form front-line services to reduce levels of national debt. Why? Most assets can be paid off over 60 years. They are in a rush to get rid of the housing debt before the general election in order—they hope—to handicap the Labour Government. They know that they have not a hope in hell of being re-elected to government and everyone else here knows that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister stood here and said that he was bringing in capping levels to save council tax payers across Scotland. He should come to Dundee and tell people that. Dundee plans to spend exactly at the capping level that the Government have imposed on the city. That means more than £8 million worth of cuts and a council tax increase of 25 per cent. Where is the saving for council tax payers in Dundee? The claim is bogus, and the Minister knows it. Nobody takes the Government seriously. Honourable Members are trying to sneak in in the last five minutes, but I just want to finish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The social work department in Dundee and Tayside has the never to tell us that there is no difference between local authority residential homes and private nursing homes. The nine local authority homes in Dundee have a waiting list. People are queuing up to get in, and yet the private nursing homes around the city are half-empty—no one wants to go into them. People are desperate to get
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
into local authority homes because the staff are better paid and there is a better quality of service. People in Scotland believe in public spending on public services—that is why Conservative Members are in the minority and Labour Members in the majority. The sooner they learn that, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was interesting to note that the Minister spent nearly all his speech attacking Opposition Members and virtually none defending his Government's record. That indicates that even the Government's Front-Bench Members realise that there is little they can defend. They recognise, as we and people outside do, that the blame for the increase in council tax will fall on the Government's shoulders, as will the blame for the increases in rents and cuts in services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere will the situation be worse than in my own city of Glasgow, where the local government settlement clearly does not reflect need. The city bears an unfair burden when compared to other parts of the country, yet that is not reflected by its local authority settlement. Glasgow's central position and its status as a metropolitan city mean that it has burdens that are not shared by other authorities. It provides theatres, art galleries, concert halls, shopping facilities, restaurants and hotels for which the cost falls, directly or indirectly, on the people of Glasgow, and yet those facilities are used by those from outside the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, because the city serves as a tourist centre and a centre for business and commerce, many people come in to play and to work and the cost of cleansing and parking services, for example, falls on the council tax payers of Glasgow, rather than on those from other areas. There are also enormous environmental pressures on Glasgow and, again, the cost is borne by people in the city, rather than by those who travel in from outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Government and the next must change their attitude to cities and accept that they are crucial to the Scottish economy. Central Government must encourage the improvement of Scottish cities by making adequate provision in their grant-awarding mechanism. Similarly, there must be a recognition through urban aid policies—my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) will speak about that later—that here is greater need and deprivation in cities than anywhere else in Scotland. The current award of urban aid grants does not adequately reflect that; it has been deliberately skewed by the Secretary of State and his acolytes for party political reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one area where the city receives more than its fair share of provision. It is related to the expansion of the Shieldhall sewage works in my constituency. Glasgow has all the deprivation and little of the current council tax payment from central Government, but it gets virtually all the you know what from the entire west of Scotland. We get the smell without the resources. When a toilet is flushed in Eastwood, the sewage ends up in my constituency. When the M77 commuters travel from the leafy suburbs into the city centre, they park their cars and disgorge their noxious fumes in my constituency. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
honourable Member for Eastwood's constituents receive the benefit and mine the detriment. The next Government must address those problems directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my final 30 seconds, I should like to respond to the cruel point that was made about payment to councillors. Councillors are in the front line of providing services to the public throughout Scotland. They are daily forced to face up to the reality of life under the Tories whereby demands on services are greater than the resources to meet them. Taking an unfair slap at councillors is typical of the Government who are concerned only with passing blame on to someone else. People in Scotland are not daft: they realise that the Government, not councillors, are to blame for tax rises and rent increases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In summing up for the Opposition, I should like to say belatedly, "welcome to South Lanarkshire". We meet in the constituency of my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the Secretary of State in his place and I should like to say something nice about him at the start of my speech. I applaud his initiative in inviting the blood transfusion unit to Hamilton today. It is ironic that such initiative is shown by a man who is sucking the life blood out of Scottish local government. I am delighted that, after making my contribution to the debate, I shall have the opportunity to go down and offer a pint of my own good blood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard figures and statistics today, but they can confuse and baffle. I am reminded of the saying that figures can lie and liars can figure.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government-supported expenditure for local government councils has increased in cash terms by only £46 million-0.7 per cent., or 2 per cent. behind the rate of inflation. That shows that we are grossly underfunded. It amounts to only 25 per cent. of what is required merely to stand still on resources, and we must not lose sight of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only last week, I received a letter from the leader of my local council in South Lanarkshire, telling me that the bid for priority partnership areas had been denied, despite the fact that the area is the fifth most needy in Scotland. Yet 12 PPAs were awarded-three to Glasgow, two to Edinburgh, one to North Lanarkshire, and others to South Ayrshire, to West Dumbarton, Dundee, Renfrewshire and, surprise, surprise, Aberdeen—with no detailed explanation of the decisions that were taken by the Scottish Office. It is easy to be suspicious in looking at the state of South Lanarkshire and comparing it with other areas that are looked after more favourably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having spoken to officers and senior politicians, it seems that South Lanarkshire is facing something in the region of £17.5 million in cuts. Council tax, with a capping figure, will be in the region of 8 per cent. The

Council has an excellent pre-five education policy and was looking forward to expanding it, but that is now under threat and may be seriously damaged. With such cuts we are no longer considering voluntary redundancies, but major compulsory redundancies. The effect of that will be alarming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of debt, about which we have heard a lot this morning. The Secretary of State said that he is concerned at the level of local authority debt. We know that all borrowing is subjected to extensive Government control. All debt repayments are strictly directed by law, and that was the case prior to the set-aside rules being put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the effects of this so-called crisis, which has been manufactured by the Government? When hon. Members are relaxing on a train or a plane while travelling to London, they should read the horror story in the South Lanarkshire press about how South Lanarkshire housing department has been deprived of millions of pounds—it has been given £343 per house compared with a national average of £555.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about the problems of my hon. Friends from Glasgow. When South Lanarkshire was formed it took a considerable amount of housing stock out of Glasgow—about 8,000 houses in the area are not wind and watertight. The hon. Member for Ayr was bragging about the new housing era through which we are living, but it is a national disgrace that politicians are still talking about an area of Scotland where 8,000 homes are not protected from wind and water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter has told us in the past few days that £60 million was spent in the national health service because of illnesses brought about by damp and inadequate housing. Therefore, it is a false economy to deprive councils of housing investment. By taking out that investment—we have seen crocodile tears from the Minister and from the hon. Member for Ayr about local contractors—local businesses, which are outwith local authorities, will feel the pinch. They will continue to suffer and many thousands of jobs will be lost in that sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in a time when questions about how we are governed and who governs us are climbing up the political agenda. For 17 years we have been governed by a Government who have centralised power to themselves and deprived local government and local communities of it. We hear the argument about Europe. They want to decentralise powers from Brussels under subsidiarity,
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
which means taking decisions as near to the member state—as locally—as possible. We should all applaud and support that but, tragically, the same Government who asked to decentralise from Europe, centralise into themselves in their own country. We are now moving into an era of new politics, where we devolve power from the centre to the regions and nations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Scottish Parliament is an important part of that decentralisation. We will decentralise with a Scottish Parliament and do the same for Wales with a Welsh Assembly. We will also have a London authority; the next Labour Government are committed to 30 per cent. of the population being covered by a devolved system of Parliament. That catalyst will create the demand throughout the rest of the United Kingdom for more decentralised government. That is what we mean when we talk about a new democracy. The Secretary of State cannot even begin to consider that. By decentralising power to the people, we will protect the democratic state that the Government have been destroying for the past 17 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I am delighted to take part in this debate in Lanarkshire, where I was born, raised and educated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating local government at the behest of the official Opposition, but given the contributions of those on the Opposition Front Bench, those who have watched our proceedings and those who will read the account of them will wonder why the Opposition chose this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate we have been given a snapshot of the conflicting attitudes of the Government and the Opposition to local government. We believe that local government has a significant role to play in the life of our nation: binding communities together and providing them with vital services. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, that is an empowering role. We have devolved significant amounts of power to local authorities, but not as an end in itself—decision making must be passed down the line to communities and eventually to individuals. Sadly, that is not the Opposition's view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strangely, for a party that poses as the champion of local government, the Opposition's policies represent a threat to local democracy. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said in his opening speech, a tax-raising Parliament in Edinburgh would hoover up the powers from local authorities. That Parliament would have a tendency to suck up power from below. Those are not my words, but those of Jean McFadden, a former Labour president of COSLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What service do we do to local communities, councils and town halls such as those here in Hamilton by taking away powers and responsibilities from local councillors to send to Calton hill? Add to that the tartan tax, escalating council tax and a trade tax that would result in returning the business rate to local authorities, and there is the seedcorn of the destruction of local democracy in our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
The right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), the Leader of the Opposition, said that one could tell the character of a political party only by its conduct in Government. Well, Labour is in government in Scotland—local government. In many places, it has been in power for decades, and we should look at the results. The Government have made a massive and in many instances successful effort to work with local government. Our positive response last year to COSLA's wish list of additional powers is only one example. There are many fine, dedicated people from all parties in local government, but some of the continuing excesses of local authorities approach caricature and discredit the whole system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, police were called to quell disturbances in the Renfrew council chamber. The Labour leader of neighbouring North Lanarkshire council installed a bidet in his office as part of a £600,000 refurbishment of the civic centre in Motherwell—Clochemerle come to Lanarkshire. Eleanor McLoughlin, the former lord provost of Edinburgh, who refused to pay her community charge, is to be commemorated by Edinburgh council in a £4,000 stained glass window—canonised, presumably, for defying the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people and many like them are making local government an expensive laughing stock and a municipal Disneyland, but the laugh—it is not funny—is on the hapless council tax payers. That is why we support capping and the Labour Party does not. The Labour party wants to be the biggest landlord in the country and retain every possible council house under local authority control. Remember how fanatically they opposed our plans to give sitting tenants the right to buy? They now take the same attitude to local government divesting itself of housing stock in favour of housing associations and local housing companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe in value for money in both central and local government—we have a moral obligation to be misers with taxpayers' money. The Labour party, however, believes in the sanctity of the in-house provision of services and the freezing out of private-sector competitive tenderers. Where we see a vehicle for empowerment, it sees nothing short of a gravy train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith spoke for almost 20 minutes when he opened the debate, but not once did he give us an insight into what any future Labour Government, of which he might be a member, would spend. The hon. Gentleman seemed to criticise the plans that were announced today by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, which allow for 30 per cent. higher spending by local authorities in Scotland than in England and 27 per cent, more than in Wales. He said time and time again that that was not enough. I shall now give him the opportunity to put the record straight here in Hamilton. If 30 per cent. more than in England and 27 per cent. more than in Wales is not enough, by how much would he increase spending where he in the position of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State? I give him the Floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered that question about four times today, but the Government have not answered my question—why are they fiddling the
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
figures for this year? We are dealing with the Conservative Scottish Office budget of 1997, not the Labour Scottish Office budget of 1998, when we will have to clear up the mess left by the Government and sort out their economic failures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the fifth time, the hon. Gentleman has not answered the question. Surely if we are to have a reasoned and rational debate about funding, it has to be about not only what the Government are doing, but what the Labour party would do, were they in our position. We have firmly and fairly said what we believe to be the right settlement for local government to be able to provide the services that our people need in the next financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have set out our stall. Is it too much to ask the Opposition local government spokesman to set out his party's stall? I am asking him for the sixth time; if spending 30 per cent. per head more than in England and 27 per cent. more than in Wales is not enough—the hon. Gentleman seemed to imply that it was not—how much more would a Labour Government spend? I would give way to the hon. Gentlemen for the sixth time, but I shall carry on speaking because the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) is obviously giving the hon. Gentleman his lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about Emma Bonino.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not respond. The official Opposition chose the subject for debate—local government—on the day when my hon. Friend the Secretary of State made his public expenditure statement. We have set out our plans. We have said where we believe money should be spent and how much should be spent, but Labour Members are sitting quiet. What kind of one-sided debate is this?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members carp and criticise, but the shadow Chancellor will not allow his party's spokesmen to speak; they have been gagged. They are asking the Scottish people to vote blindly, because they will not say how much more they will spend. They will not say how they disagree with the spending plans of my right hon. Friend and where they would make alterations. We must therefore take it that either the Labour party is conning the Scottish people deliberately, or it has not got a clue. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said that both statements are true, but the Scottish people will be the judges, come the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important fact to emerge from the debate is that the differences between the Government and the Opposition go far deeper than wrangling over finances. There is a deep philosophical gulf between us. The hon. Member for Hamilton has returned and is muttering from a sedentary position. The Labour party remains stubbornly imbued with the arrogant notion that local government exists for the benefit of those who run it. We believe that its purpose is to serve taxpayers—councillors are elected to public service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
In Scotland today, a new perception of local government is emerging, slowly but inevitably. People want to make decisions for themselves, and to be told by councillors in what shade of what colour they should paint the front door of their council house. Those days are gone, thanks to the Government. We will have increased owner occupation in Scotland from 35 per cent. to 60 per cent. by the end of this Parliament. In the teeth of furious opposition from the Labour party, we have given our people access to owning their own home. That is one of the great social reforms of this century and has made a huge difference to the quality of life of Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
Many more reforms are necessary to complete the liberation of our people on the threshold of a new millennium. We shall overcome Labour's opposition to them as well. In doing so, we shall liberate local government from the straitjacket of town hall Leninism and make it what it deserves to be: a great motor of individual empowerment and community responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman and Commissioner for Local Administration in Scotland Bill</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman and Commissioner for Local Administration in Scotland Bill in relation to its principle.</p></blockquote>
The Bill amends the provisions relating to the Scottish legal services ombudsman contained in the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990, and the provisions relating to the commissioner for local administration contained in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill implements a proposal made by the present Scottish legal services ombudsman, Mr. Garry Watson, in his 1994 annual report to the Secretary of State. He proposed that he should have the power to recommend that a professional organisation—that is, the Law Society of Scotland, the Faculty of Advocates and shortly the Scottish Conveyancing and Executry Services Board—should pay compensation of up to £1,000 to complainers who have suffered loss or distress because of the organisation's poor handling of their complaint about the conduct of a solicitor, advocate or, shortly, a qualified conveyancer or executory practitioner. The opportunity is also taken to clarify the Ombudsman's existing powers and to bring them broadly into line with those of the legal services ombudsman in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this point, it would be convenient to clarify a point raided about costs by the Law Society of Scotland. The society wants clarification of the definition of "costs" in clause 2, new section 34A(3) (f), so that it relates only to out-of-pocket expenses. The central point is that the person making the complaint would not have a greater right to costs than the pursuer in court action. Can the Ministry shed any light on that definition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can say that the experience south of the border has been that the costs recommended to be paid usually have not exceeded £500 and often have been less than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member asked me about clause 2, which requires the ombudsman to make a report at the end of his investigation and send it to the complainer, the professional organisation and the practitioner. The report can include one or more of a range of recommendations, with the ombudsman's reasons. The recommendations are as follows: first, that the professional organisation provide a better explanation to the complainer; secondly, that the professional organisation reconsider the complaint or investigate it further; thirdly, that the professional organisation consider exercising its powers in relation to the practitioner; fourthly, that the professional organisation pay compensation of up to £1,000 for poor complaint handling; finally, where such compensation is recommended, that the professional organisation reimburse the complainer's cost in making the handling complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
The professional organisation must have regard to the report's conclusions and recommendations and notify the ombudsman and complainer within three months of the action that it has taken or proposes to take to comply. Where it fails to comply with a recommendation, it must publicise the failure and any reasons for it. That is of particular importance and, if the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) is willing to volunteer to join the Standing Committee scrutinising the Bill, we can go into the matter in greater detail then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the power of the Scottish local government ombudsman to ensure the highest standards of local government conduct, and of redress for the citizen, by enabling him to investigate maladministration arising from the actions of individual members of authorities within his jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision arises from the report of the joint Scottish Office—COSLA task force on local government conduct which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set up in July 1995. It corrects an anomaly in the law, which has meant that the Scottish local government ombudsman, unlike his counterparts south of the border, has been unable to investigate maladministration that arises from the actions of individual members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will, therefore, improve consumer protection for members of the public who use legal services in Scotland or obtain services from a local council or similar body. The Law Society and the Faculty of Advocates have been consulted on, and are content with, the compensation provision that the ombudsman recommended. Scottish local government supports the new powers for the commissioner for local administration in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, the reimbursement of costs is at the ombudsman's discretion. He may, however, make only a are recommendation, which the Law Society does not need necessarily to accept. The ombudsman can recommend the reimbursement of costs only in the case complaints of mishandling. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman. I strongly commend the Bill to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Law Society would be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has sat down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.21 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>((Edinburgh, Leith))</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition do not oppose for the sake of opposing. We largely welcome the Bill and particularly the provisions that allow the legal ombudsman to recommend compensation. The Opposition argued for such provisions in 1990 in the Committee that considered the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had two questions on legal matters, but my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow has already asked one of them. My other question was raised by the Law Society and concerns clause 1. It is worried that questions of confidentiality may arise in respect of material in a solicitor's file. It recommends
	<br><blockquote><p>"that clause 1(5) be amended to provide for the production by the Law Society to the Ombudsman only of such material as it is entitled in law to produce."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
I would welcome the Ministry's comments, as a lawyer, on that. I am not a lawyer, so I shall say nothing more on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My areas of responsibility do, however, cover the Bill's relatively simple proposals in regard to the commissioner for local administration. There is one major proposal, which we welcome. Most complaints concern alleged breaches of the national code of conduct for councillors and it is, therefore, right that the ombudsman should have the power to investigate councillors. The Opposition take the strongest view of standards of probity in local government and thoroughly welcome the provisions that deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.23 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>((Fife, North-East))</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) asked about the effects of new section 34A(3) (f), but the Ministry did not provide an adequate answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a slightly Scottish point. The use of the word "cost" or "costs" is an import from south of the border. When we in Scotland deal with matters such as those in the Bill we conventionally use the word "expenses". That aside, the Bill offers no criteria against which the ombudsman should determine the level of costs or expenses. He is not even enjoined to act reasonably and it would be open to him to make a substantial recommendation that was far in excess of the £500 that customary south of the border. This part of the Bill is unspecific and poorly drafted and will have to be remedied in Committee—if not before—to ensure that there is a proper limit on the ombudsman's exercise of discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) referred to clause 1(5), which requires,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the professional organisation concerned to provide such information, or produce such documents,"</p></blockquote>
as the ombudsman considers relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "require" has a specific and important meaning in law: it means that there is no alternative to producing documents if they are sought by the ombudsman who has the power to make a requirement. I hope that the Government will recognise that there is a danger of failing to understand that documents may be in the possession of the Faculty of Advocates or the Law Society of Scotland for purposes other than those related to the complaint or, indeed, that documents have been provided on a confidential basis. The provision would require those bodies to offer up the documents, notwithstanding the fact that they had been accepted confidentially. That is inappropriate and the provision therefore requires amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Leith said a moment ago, the extent of the requirement should be based on an obligation on the two bodies to provide only such material as they are entitled to provide in law. Unless that provision is introduced, the legislation will confer a draconian power, which will give rise to continuing dispute between the ombudsman and the two bodies as to whether particular documents should be provided in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is recognised as important by the Law Society. It deals with new section 34A (2) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the ombudsman decides to make a complaint about the practitioner concerned to the appropriate disciplinary body he may include in the report…a statement to that effect."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
At present, under section 51 of the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980, the ombudsman has the power to make a complaint to the discipline tribunal about the conduct of a practitioner. Proceedings before the discipline tribunal may be in private or in public, at the tribunal's discretion. Until such proceedings are commenced, however, the ombudsman cannot assume that they will be public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ombudsman's opinion is not a private document. There have been cases in the past—and doubtless will be in future—in which the ombudsman's opinion has been made public. It is therefore possible that publicity could be given to an intention by the ombudsman to refer a solicitor, or a firm of solicitors, to a discipline tribunal. That intention may not proceed further, either because the ombudsman abandons his intention or because the tribunal decides that the information on which to base the complaint is inadequate. Alternatively, a complaint having been lodged, a prosecutor appointed for the purpose of conducting the proceedings before the tribunal may decide that there is inadequate evidence on which to support the prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, individuals or firms of solicitors could find themselves subject of publicity in relation to an intention by the ombudsman which is never carried through to the point of prosecution. That is wholly inappropriate. I do not know whether that is English practice. If it is, I certainly believe that it should not be adopted in Scotland. Otherwise, the Bill has much to recommend it. The matters to which I have drawn attention are of significance and should be properly considered when the details can be debated more thoroughly in a Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps improperly, I have failed to declare an interest. It is well known that I am a member of the Faculty of Advocates and that, from time to time, I practise in that capacity. The Bill should not be rejected, but it requires revision before it can properly reflect the system that is desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested and delighted too hear the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) and I look forward to hearing his contribution in Committee when we shall get down to the detail. We always welcome those who sit in Committee with a background in the legal profession. By speaking, I imagine that the hon. and learned Gentleman is volunteering for the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill because many years ago I served on the Select Committee which dealt with the ombudsman and other relevant matters. Everyone in Scotland will benefit from the legislation when it goes through its parliamentary stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's proceedings are another splendid example of the Scottish Grand Committee dealing with Scottish legislation in Scotland. They demonstrate very clearly how that can be done. We can deal with all stages provided, of course, that the party which wants the Bill to become law has a majority in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that were there a hint of controversy about the Bill, it would not be dealt with by the Scottish Grand Committee.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
Member for Fife, North-East on confidentiality. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond when he sums up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ombudsman system is now an established part of our governmental system and, while I regret that the United Kingdom version of the parliamentary and local government ombudsman is not like the original Scandinavian predecessors, such ombudsmen provide a valuable court of last resort when maladministration is alleged to have taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from my constituency mailbag that today's citizens feel vulnerable in the face of large corporations, Government systems and, in some cases, the Law Society, especially when such organisations are self-policing and control their own discipline and complaints. The ombudsman can act as a valuable friend in court neutrally to investigate the complaints of individual citizens. Therefore, I broadly welcome the measure as an extension of the present system—giving powers to obtain information and documents, to make recommendations and to be notified of the outcome of adjudications as well as extending jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is to be broadly welcomed, but I look forward to the Minister's reply to the very specific points raised by the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I heard the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East speak, I could hear the grinding of the wheels to close the gate in front of one of the biggest closed shops remaining in our society—the legal profession. I welcome the Bill as it deals with what is, in the opinion of many of my constituents and of many other people in Scotland, one of the professions most protected from its own maladministration. It is difficult to get a feeling from the public that there is any way to get redress against lawyers through lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was concerned to discover whether the Bill mentioned appointing a true ombudsman or just another complaints commissioner. I sit on the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and we have expressed anxieties that, for example, the prisons ombudsman in England and Wales is no ombudsman at all. As we saw recently, he was subject to interference from a political force, although an ombudsman should be capable of scrutinising politicians' behaviour, right up to ministerial level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the Bill held out some hope that this would be a true ombudsman, but the debate has suggested many things that would negate that purpose—the person would cease to be an ombudsman and become merely a complaints commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of access to all information was a recent subject of debate in the Select Committee when we recommended that there should be freedom of information Act. One of the debates between the Home Secretary, Cabinet members and the ombudsman was whether the ombudsman—the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration—should have access to all papers including Cabinet papers. The Select Committee felt very strongly, despite the Government's response, that the ombudsman should have access to all papers. That is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
only way in which an ombudsman can properly carry out the role. The ombudsman must have access to all papers and be treated with the respect that he would give to the papers—they would be treated in a confidential manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To hear arguments from the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East against access to papers because of confidentiality within his profession is to say that the ombudsman would not be able to act properly as an ombudsman. Ombudsmen must have access to all available papers to examine the case properly and to scrutinise all the information. We must rely on the ombudsman system, in which this ombudsman would be included, to treat those papers with proper respect and not allow them to be seen by third parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "costs" was mentioned and there was a reference to expenses. Perhaps there is an issue to examine in that. In every case that I have come across in which the ombudsman wants to put the position clearly, it comes down to whether he believes that there should be some redress. Whether that is called costs expenses is for the Committee to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An ombudsman should have the right and the power to award compensation to someone who suffers as a result of maladministration. However, we should not run away from the fact that the public expect an ombudsman to be independent, to consider every relevant fact—including all the relevant documents—and, if necessary, to award compensation to anyone who is proved to be rightly aggrieved as a result of maladministration by a professional body or department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.35 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that all of us who are constituency Members of Parliament have different experiences. However, I am bound to say that I am very impressed by the level of knowledge that is shown by solicitors who are involved in cases about which I have been approached. I make it a rule never to get involved in a case of tort or in which a lawyer is involved without talking to the solicitor first. If one does not, one may well be doing a disservice to the constituent who approached one. If one rings up the solicitor, he almost always knows straightaway about the case and can explain its background without having to refer to his papers. The solicitors' profession in Scotland does many creditable things. Although solicitors take a great deal of flak, I must say that my constituency experience of their work is very favourable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one or two questions to ask. My first question arises from a letter that I received from Lynne MacMillan of the Scottish Consumer Council. She wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If they fail to respond within 3 months then they must publicise that failure. If the professional body decides not to comply with the recommendation, they must give reasons for this failure to comply, and can be required to publicise this."</p></blockquote>
Are the Government happy about that situation? Is the three-month rule realistic in relation to day-to-day practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I must reiterate—without fully going over the matter again—the important question about clause 2 and new section 34A(2), which was raised by the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East. When I was at the Law Society of Scotland last Friday, its representatives laid great emphasis on a query about section 51. They are seriously concerned about that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
provision. I understood the Minister to say earlier—I tried to interrupt him before he finished his speech—that the Law Society of Scotland was content. It is not my impression that it is content about the matter. When he winds up, he might like to clarify what he thinks the Law Society of Scotland is content about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 34A will give the ombudsman the power to recommend to the professional organisation that it should consider exercising its powers. The provision changes the role of the ombudsman from that of adjudicating over the handling of a complaint to exercising an adjudication function with regard to the merits of a complaint. The statutory responsibility for determining the merits of a complaint against a solicitor rests with the Law Society of Scotland and the Scottish solicitors' discipline tribunal. Such a fundamental change in the role of the ombudsman is inappropriate. That is inconsistent with the remit of the ombudsman, which is to investigate only the handling of complaints; the proposal conflicts with the statutory duties of the professional body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's attitude towards handling as opposed to merits? From time to time, I have been turned down when I have asked for a case to be considered, perhaps because a question of merit rather than of handling was involved—I suspect that my colleagues may also have found that to be the case. Is not there some scope for giving the ombudsman greater flexibility—and the opportunity to use his judgment—in relation to those cases about which he feels that morally he should conduct an investigation, when legally he is prevented from doing so? The ombudsman should be given more discretion in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to new section 34(A)5, the Law Society of Scotland says that it is inappropriate for the ombudsman's report to be accorded absolute privilege. It feels that such privilege is of a high order and generally reserved only for special circumstances such as proceedings in Parliament; the court or tribunals have the attributes of a court. It says that that should not be extended to cover the reports of an appointed official. Do the Government have any sympathy with the Law Society's qualms—I put it no more strongly than that—about that matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Bill contains no provisions requiring the ombudsman to exercise his powers in a reasonable manner. The Law Society says that it is essential for the ombudsman to have an obligation of reasonableness in relation to the exercise of any of the Bill's provisions. What is the Government's view of the concept of reasonableness? This is an important Bill, and I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Leith, who welcomed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.41 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Committee for the general welcome that it has given the Bill. I shall answer briefly the various points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) asked about the handling of complaints. We believe that the ombudsman should consider the handling of a complaint by the Law Society of Scotland, but that he should not
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
consider the merits of a case. It is right for the profession to be self-regulatory. He also asked about absolute privilege. It is right for the ombudsman's report to be absolutely privileged in Scotland, as it is in England and Wales. To give the reports qualified privilege would involve those who consider themselves to be defamed trying to prove that the ombudsman had acted with malice when he was fulfilling a statutory role. We consider that to be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Law Society's views on costs, it is content with the power to recommend compensation. It has not responded to the Bill's general provisions. If it wishes to send in representations, I should be interested to read them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When do the representations have to be in by?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sooner that is done the better. Only a few days ago, I met the president of the Law Society to discuss other matters, but I do not recall him making any reference to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we support self-regulation. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) asked whether the proposals involved a watchdog without teeth. I have to say no, they do not. Of the 109 opinions that were issued by the ombudsman in relation to Law Society cases for 1995, only 38 were critical—they contained recommendations that more should be done. By the end of the year, the Law Society had responded to 33 of those cases and it had accepted the ombudsman's view or taken further action in 28 cases. That does not suggest to me that the ombudsman is lacking effective teeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) asked about confidential papers. The ombudsman can require bodies to produce such information only if he considers it to be relevant—that is the position south of the border. The ombudsman is concerned only with the Law Society's handling of a case—confidential papers from solicitors' offices are not relevant. The hon. and learned Gentleman was also concerned about the costs to a complainer of handling a complaint. The ombudsman can recommend costs only if the relevant complaint is made; he cannot do so in every case. That situation works well in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister understand that the question of relevance is for the ombudsman—and for him alone—to determine? He said that if papers were confidential, they would not be relevant. The power that is given to the ombudsman does not make that distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member will appreciate that I am a lawyer, as he is.

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—[	<i>Mr. McLoughlin.</i>]</p>
	<p>2.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to have obtained the Adjournment debate today because it provides the sole opportunity for Glasgow's case to be aired in the Scottish Grand Committee and to obtain a reply from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow is shouldering all the cuts in the urban programme. The annual spend will fall by £10 million from 1996–97 to 1998–99. In the current year the spend is £31 million; next year it will be down to £24 million; the year after that, it will be down to £20.4 million. The total Scottish spend on the urban programme will fall from £81.6 million in 1996–97 to £73 million in 1998–99.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even with priority partnership areas, Glasgow has been short changed. It has 51 per cent. of the need within the designated priority partnership areas across Scotland, but receives only 31 per cent. of the three-year budget. Glasgow has 55 per cent. of the need in the regeneration programme areas across Scotland, but has received only 20 per cent. of the three-year budget. Voluntary projects which could have expected an extension in previous circumstances are facing extinction with a maximum of four months' notice and substantial job losses in deprived areas. The three-year cost of the extension alone is approximately £9 million, but Scottish Office funds for extensions and new projects is £2.1 million—a cut of 76 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That cut in the regeneration programme money for Glasgow from £14.6 million in 1996–97 to £5.3 million in 1998–99 gives us 73 per cent. of total Scottish moneys, yet the Glasgow regeneration programme contains 24 per cent. of the worst 10 per cent EDs in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the decisions were based on need and the quality of the submissions. The Scottish Office has admitted that Glasgow's submissions do not fail on quality grounds and the need is demonstrable. Why has Glasgow been starved of funds and unfairly denied a share that reflects its needs? Hundreds of projects in Drumchapel, Easterhouse, Castlemilk, Govan, Pollok, Shettleston, Royston, Bridgeton, Maryhill and elsewhere across the city. The list runs for several pages in the note that I received from the council. Hundreds of projects are awaiting their fate and many of those districts are well known for their level of unemployment and poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, 23 projects are hanging on from month to month, and it is not known whether they will survive beyond January. They include respite care, day care, mental health, disability, child care, out-of-school care and community groups of various types. They include the women's centre in Maryhill where the new building has only been up a few years. If that well-used project falls, the capital costs will also have been wasted. There may well be similar cases of capital costs being thrown aside as if they were of no account in other constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such programmes in poverty-stricken areas across the city have the task of tackling poverty, developing disadvantaged communities and providing community facilities. Several undertake work related to alcohol and drug addiction. What is the point of going to war on drugs if the Scottish Office does not back up the people who
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
are dealing with the problem in our communities, day in, day out and who do not simply hold press conferences about it? Some programmes deal with young offenders and with alternatives to custody or with victim support. Everyone agrees that we should do more about such objectives, but those programmes are likely to be terminated as well. Support for the elderly and for care-in-the-community projects saves the Government money by making it possible for people not to live in long-stay care, but those projects also face closure. All of that is on top of the mainstream budget cuts that were discussed earlier today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in Glasgow are saying that the Government have just decided not to help Glasgow. Before the Minister predictably asks me from whom the money should be taken, let me tell him that Glasgow does not want to rob anyone else of their rightful due, but we demand equitable treatment, which glasgow is not getting. If the Minister cannot explain on what grounds Glasgow's needs are being spurned, leading to many desirable and much needed projects being forced to close down, he will be duty bound as a man of honesty and integrity to stop the juggernaut that is laying waste to our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is convinced that the Scottish Office figures are justified and that it is right to close down all those projects because Glasgow is getting its fair share of the money, will he at least come to Glasgow and discuss the figures with Glasgow councillors before matters proceed any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.52 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) on securing the Adjournment debate. I shall endeavour to answer the points she raised. It would be useful at the outset, however, if I explain the changes that have taken place this year in the method of making urban programme allocations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The urban regeneration policies that we are now implementing have been arrived at after extensive consultation going back to late 1993. Throughout that period, there has been overwhelming support for the policy changes from local authorities and other consulted bodies. Until this financial year, urban programme funds were allocated on the basis of individual project applications made to the Scottish Office by local authorities. That approach had a number of deficiencies. Decisions on which projects to support were taken centrally by the Scottish Office. Moreover, decisions were taken only once a year in an annual competition. The process also lacked a strategic focus at local level. Local authorities, local communities and other partner agencies such as Scottish Homes and local enterprise companies which were responsible for drafting and implementing a local regeneration strategy, could have no certainty about which projects would be selected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the considerable effort made by community groups at local level in working out detailed project applications, submitting them to the local authority and then to the Scottish Office was often wasted since the competition was invariably significantly oversubscribed. Finally, some of the eligibility criteria for the urban programme, such as the requirement for projects to be innovative, made it unhelpfully inflexible, not necessarily addressing local needs on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
As well as rectifying some of those deficiencies in the urban programme, in formulating a new urban regeneration strategy we were keen to build on the success of the four experimental Scottish Office-led urban partnerships in Castlemilk in Glasgow, Ferguslie Park in Paisley, Wester Hailes in Edinburgh and Whitfield in Dundee. Since they began in 1988, the partnerships have demonstrated considerable achievements as a result of their strategic, comprehensive, multi-agency approaches to regeneration. Indeed, with the involvement of all the appropriate bodies, including the local communities and the private sector, the partnerships broke new ground and were widely admired. Their achievements include the following: unemployment has been cut in half; more than 11,000 people have been placed in jobs; the private sector has invested some £60 million; up to one in five houses are now owned by their occupiers; crime is down by 41 per cent. in Wester Hailes, 25 per cent. in Castlemilk and more than 20 per cent. in Whitfield. More children are attending school and attaining qualifications in Ferguslie Park and Castlemilk. Far more people are now satisfied with the area in which they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our new policy, programme for partnership, brought together the two strands-seeking to replicate the partnership's successes more widely across Scotland and making better use of the urban programme. Under programme for partnership, we invited the main regeneration agencies to form partnerships with the private sector and representatives of their local communities to bid in competition with each other in areas to be designated priority partnership areas or PPAs where deprivation is most concentrated. In addition, we invited authorities to bid for regeneration programmes for those areas eligible for urban programme resources but outside the worst concentrations of deprivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our prime intention in implementing that policy was to ensure that all the relevant public agencies, together with local communities and the private sector, focused resources on the selected areas and, by working in partnership, made the best possible use of the available resources. The urban programme funds would be allocated in a block to authorities on the basis of strategic aims agreed with the Scottish Office. That meant that decisions on which particular projects to support to achieve those aims would be devolved to the local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of June this year, we received bids from authorities on behalf of them and their regeneration partners for urban programme funds under programme for partnership. In total, we received 29 bids for PPA status and 21 bids for regeneration programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those bids covered areas eligible for urban programme funds—that is, they fell within the most deprived 10 per cent. of urban areas in Scotland as measured by analysis of the census results. In assessing the bids, the relative deprivation of the areas was taken into account, as were other factors—for example, how clearly the area's problems were identified and analysed,
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
how appropriate the strategy was and whether all partners, including the private sector and local community, were fully involved and committed to it. Because of those additional factors, the league table recently produced by the Poverty Alliance is misleading because it shows the resources allocated only in relation to the extent of deprivation in each council area and not in each PPA area. As a result, I was pleased to announce on 11 November the designation of 12 new priority partnership areas and 11 regeneration programmes. The selected PPAS were those with the best strategies for the most deprived areas. In total, I was able to announce the allocation of almost £60 million of urban programme funds over the next three years. As you would expect, Mr. Maxton, Glasgow featured prominently in my announcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be in danger of misleading us. Although Glasgow featured, he can hardly claim that it featured to the extent that it should have done considering the extent of its needs, which I described earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady allows me to continue, I shall develop the point that I have just made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have designated three new priority partnership areas in Glasgow city: Glasgow north, the east end and greater Easterhouse. That selection coincided with the first three priorities put to us by the council and its partners. I know that the Ruchill and Possilpark areas of the hon. Lady's constituency form part of the Glasgow north PPA and I hope that in time, she will see the benefits from that. I know that the exclusion of Milton in the hon. Lady's constituency is a matter of concern to her, but that decision was taken by those submitting the bids from Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The resources allocated to the three new PPAs in Glasgow total £14.1 million over the three years to 1998-99. That consists of a firm allocation of £1.2 million for the current financial year and indicative allocations, subject to resources, of £12.9 million in 1997–98 and 1998–99.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures represent 33 per cent. of the total allocation made to the 12 new PPAs. In addition, urban programme resources will continue to be allocated over that period to Castlemilk during the remainder of its life as a partnership area. The sum of £2.1 million of new resources has been allocated to Glasgow's regeneration programme. Added to the £14.1 million allocated to the new PPSAs that makes a total allocation of £16.2 million of new resources to Glasgow. Some £59 million has already been committed to urban programme projects in Glasgow for 1996–97, 1997–98, and 1998–99. Over three years, Glasgow will receive total urban programme expenditure of around £77 million. That is 36 per cent. of the total projected urban programme spend in Scotland and is comparable with Glasgow's urban programme share in recent years. I hope that the hon. Lady will acknowledge that that is a considerable commitment to Glasgow's deprived areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear that existing funding commitments, including for projects run by the voluntary sector, will be honoured. The funding periods agreed for those projects are unaffected by the funding allocation that I announced in November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
Hard choices need to be made in regeneration programme areas about which projects will continue to be funded after their initial periods. That is an inevitable consequence of the focusing of resources that has always been a key aspect of the programme for partnership. We have never sought to conceal that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have identified around 50 voluntary sector projects for Glasgow that terminate in 1996–97 and would have been eligible for further funding under previous urban programme allocation arrangements. Another 55 or so programmes would have been eligible during the following two years for extension funding, making around 105 such projects that will terminate during those three financial years and will compete for available funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of those will fall within the PPAs and must be eligible for funding through the allocations to those areas. The three new PPAs and the city's top regeneration priorities and £14 million of new urban programme expenditure has been allocated to them for the next three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister sits down, will he say something about areas that do not fall within the PPAs, whose funding will be spread extremely thinly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady seems to forget that the money that I announced last November is not the only source of funds for such areas. For example, Glasgow
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
Development Agency has spent £316 million since 1991 to regenerate the city's industrial base and improve skills. It has also levered in £411 from the private sector. Glasgow's funding situation is not nearly as bleak as the hon. Lady has painted it. Glasgow has an urban programme allocation of £16.2 million for new expenditure between now and March 1999. The council and its partners in the Glasgow regeneration alliance will be able to decide at local level which projects to support, provided those are consistent with the strategic aims and outputs agreed with the Scottish Office. Glasgow's total share of the urban programme in that period will remain significant, at 36 per cent. of total Scottish provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I repeat that existing funding commitments will be honoured. No project need to be terminated before the end of the agreed funding period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
